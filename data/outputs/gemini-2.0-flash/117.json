Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure is composed of 5 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure has 3 distinct layers.\n    *   Layer 1 (bottom): Arch block, two sloped blocks.\n    *   Layer 2 (middle): Rectangular block\n    *   Layer 3 (top): Square block\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The arch block is at the bottom, supporting the entire structure.\n    *   Two sloped blocks are placed on either side of the arch block, partially supporting the green rectangular block above.\n    *   The green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the arch and sloped blocks.\n    *   The square block is placed on top of the green rectangular block.\n\n**2. Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the target image, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Arch block (orange): Index 1\n*   Sloped blocks (orange, oriented as facing outward and down): Index 11 and 12\n*   Rectangular block (green, horizontal): Index 6\n*   Square block (orange): Index 9\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Assembly Order:**\n\n1.  Start with the arch block (index 1) as it forms the base.\n2.  Place the sloped blocks (index 11 and 12) on either side of the arch.\n3.  Place the green rectangular block (index 6) on top of the arch and sloped blocks.\n4.  Finally, place the square block (index 9) on top of the green rectangular block.\n"

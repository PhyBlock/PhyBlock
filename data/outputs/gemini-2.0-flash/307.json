Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n    *   **Block Count:** 7\n    *   **Layers:** 5\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   Two red arch blocks (1st layer) act as the foundation, oriented with their arches facing each other.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block (2nd layer) sits atop the arches.\n        *   A green rectangular block (3rd layer) stands vertically on the yellow block.\n        *   Another yellow rectangular block (4th layer) is positioned on top of the green block.\n        *   An orange triangular prism block (5th layer) forms the top of the structure.\n*   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n    *   **Block Count:** 3\n    *   **Layers:** 3\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   Two red arch blocks (1st and 3rd layers) are stacked one on top of the other, oriented with their arches facing each other.\n        *   A blue cube and green cube (2nd layer) are placed between the arches. The green cube is below the blue cube.\n\n**2. Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n    *   Red Arch (Bottom): Block 1 (x2)\n    *   Yellow Rectangle (2nd layer): Block 9\n    *   Green Rectangle (Vertical): Block 7\n    *   Yellow Rectangle (4th layer): Block 9\n    *   Orange Triangle: Block 12\n*   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n    *   Red Arch (Bottom): Block 1 (x2)\n    *   Blue Cube: Block 5\n    *   Green Cube: Block 6\n\n**3. Determining the Assembly Order and Outputting Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```"

Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure consists of 7 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** It has four layers. The first layer has four orange cylinders. The second layer has two yellow rectangular cuboids laid side by side. The third layer is made with one cylinder and the top layer is made with one yellow arch.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer has four orange cylinders forming the \"legs\" of the structure.\n    *   Two yellow cuboids are placed on top of the four cylinders, forming a rectangular platform.\n    *   Another orange cylinder stands vertically on top of the platform.\n    *   A yellow semi-cylindrical block (arch) is placed on top of the vertical orange cylinder.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Based on the analysis, we need:\n    *   Four orange cylinders. (Block 7)\n    *   Two horizontal yellow rectangular cuboids (Block 2)\n    *   One vertical orange cylinder (Block 3)\n    *   One yellow arch (Block 11)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 2, 3, 11\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the spatial relationships and the selected blocks, the assembly order is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n\"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n\"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n\"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n\"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n\"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n\"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n\"Step7\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n\"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```"

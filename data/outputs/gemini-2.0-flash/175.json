            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the target image and construct the assembly instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image contains two separate structures: a \"giraffe\" and a \"house.\"\n\n*   **Giraffe Structure:**\n    *   Number of Blocks: 10\n    *   Number of Layers (Rough Estimate): 6\n    *   Spatial Relationships:\n        *   The base is made of four orange cylinders.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block rests on top of the cylinders.\n        *   A blue cube is placed on the yellow block, offset to one side.\n        *   An orange triangle block is placed on the blue cube, angled to one side.\n        *   Another yellow rectangular block sits above the lower yellow block.\n        *   An orange triangle block sits on the upper yellow rectangular block.\n        *   A yellow curved block is on top of the last orange triangle block.\n\n*   **House Structure:**\n    *   Number of Blocks: 7\n    *   Number of Layers: 4\n    *   Spatial Relationships:\n        *   The base is made of two orange cubes, two blue cubes.\n        *   A green rectangular block rests on top of the lower cubes.\n        *   Two orange triangle blocks form the roof.\n\n**2. Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nHere's a list of the block indices needed, based on the Block Dictionary image, to match the target structure's blocks:\n\n*   **Giraffe:**\n    *   Cylinders (4): 10 (4 times)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Blocks (2): 9 (2 times)\n    *   Blue Cube (1): 1\n    *   Orange Triangle Blocks (2): 14 (2 times)\n    *   Yellow Curved Block (1): 11\n\n*   **House:**\n    *   Orange Cubes (2): 3 (2 times)\n    *   Blue Cubes (2): 1 (2 times)\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (1): 6\n    *   Orange Triangle Blocks (2): 14 (2 times)\n\n**3. Determining the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the proposed assembly order based on the selected blocks, presented in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step17\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Assembly Order:**\n\n1.  Steps 1-4: Place the four orange cylinders for the giraffe's legs.\n2.  Step 5: Place the first yellow rectangular block on top of the cylinders.\n3.  Step 6: Place the blue cube on the yellow rectangular block.\n4.  Step 7: Place the first orange triangle block on the blue cube.\n5.  Step 8: Place the second yellow rectangular block on top of the lower yellow rectangular block.\n6.  Step 9: Place the second orange triangle block on the upper yellow rectangular block.\n7.  Step 10: Place the yellow curved block on top of the last orange triangle block to form the head.\n8.  Steps 11-14: Place the two orange and two blue cubes as the base of the house.\n9.  Step 15: Place the green rectangular block on the cubes.\n10. Steps 16-17: Place the two orange triangle blocks on the green rectangular block to form the roof.\n"

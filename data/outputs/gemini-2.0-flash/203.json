            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and create the assembly instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure is composed of 11 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** There are essentially 4-5 layers if you consider the two separate structures and the topmost pyramid as a layer.\n\n    *   **Left Structure:** has a tower of 5 blocks, with a rectangular base and two shorter rectangular blocks on top.\n    *   **Right Structure:** consists of 6 blocks. It has a base with an arch, a yellow block on top, another arch, and finally a pyramid roof.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   **Left Structure:** The base is three orange cylinders stacked vertically. On top of those are two yellow rectangular blocks that form a horizontal extension.\n    *   **Right Structure:** Red arch block on the bottom, yellow rectangular block horizontally oriented placed above, then a red arch block oriented the same way as the bottom one. Finally the red triangle rests on the last arch to complete the structure.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Indices:**\n\n    *   Red Arch Base: 1\n    *   Yellow Rectangle (Horizontal): 6\n    *   Red Arch Top: 1\n    *   Red Triangle (roof): 11\n    *   Orange Cylinder: 7\n    *   Orange Cylinder: 7\n    *   Orange Cylinder: 7\n    *   Yellow Rectangle (Horizontal): 6\n    *   Yellow Rectangle (Horizontal): 6\n    *   Red Arch Base: 1\n    *   Red Triangle (roof): 11\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```\n**Explanation of the assembly order**\n\n* First three steps: Put together the tower of three orange cylinders.\n* Fourth and Fifth steps: Add the two yellow rectangles to the orange tower.\n* Sixth step: Add the Red Arch Base.\n* Seventh step: Add the yellow block.\n* Eighth step: Add another Red Arch Base\n* Ninth step: Add a red triangle as the roof.\n* Tenth step: We add the orange cylinder to make the tower higher.\n* Eleventh step: Place the roof of triangle red as last element.\n"

Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure consists of 5 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** It appears to have 3 layers:\n    *   Layer 1: Two wedge-shaped blocks on the bottom.\n    *   Layer 2: A cylindrical block in the middle.\n    *   Layer 3: A U-shaped block on top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two wedge blocks are placed on either side of the cylindrical block, with their flat, wider sides facing the ground and angled upwards towards the cylinder.\n    *   The cylindrical block is placed directly on top of the imaginary line joining the two flat surfaces of the two wedge blocks.\n    *   The U-shaped block is placed on top of the cylindrical block.\n\n**2. Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the target image, the following blocks are required from the dictionary:\n\n*   Two wedge blocks that are tilted. Based on the available options, these are most closely represented by index 13 and 16.\n*   One cylindrical block in a vertical orientation, represented by index 7.\n*   One U-shaped block, with the open side facing down. This is best represented by index 2.\n\n**3. Determining the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a possible assembly order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Assembly Order:**\n\n1.  Place the first wedge block (index 13) on the ground.\n2.  Place the second wedge block (index 16) on the ground, mirroring the first one.\n3.  Place the cylindrical block (index 7) on top of the wedge blocks, centering it between them.\n4.  Place the U-shaped block (index 2) on top of the cylindrical block.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```"

            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Overall Structure:** The main target image shows two distinct structures, a house and a taller, more abstract building, both made of colored blocks.\n*   **House Structure:** The house consists of 4 layers. The bottom layer is a red rectangular block. The second layer is a yellow rectangular block. The third layer is a green rectangular block. The top layer is two orange triangular blocks forming a roof.\n*   **Abstract Structure:** The abstract building is composed of 7 blocks, arranged in 3 main layers (with blocks stacked within those layers). The bottom layer consists of two red arch blocks. The second layer consists of a yellow rectangular block bridging the two arches. On top of the yellow rectangle is a blue cube. To the right, also on top of the yellow rectangle is a green rectangular block. On top of the blue cube is an orange triangle. On top of the green rectangular block is an orange triangle.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The red arch blocks are adjacent to each other. The yellow rectangle bridges them. The blue cube and green rectangle are adjacent on top of the yellow rectangle.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Blocks Needed for the House:**\n    *   Red rectangular block: Index 5\n    *   Yellow rectangular block: Index 9\n    *   Green rectangular block: Index 7\n    *   Orange triangular block: Index 13 (x2)\n*   **Blocks Needed for the Abstract Structure:**\n    *   Red arch block: Index 1 (x2)\n    *   Yellow rectangular block: Index 9\n    *   Blue cube: Index 3\n    *   Green rectangular block: Index 8\n    *   Orange triangular block: Index 13 (x2)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I'll construct the assembly instructions. The order is determined by what blocks are on the bottom and work my way up.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** There are 11 blocks in the structure.\n*   **Layers:** The tallest structure has 5 layers. The structure to the left has 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**  A red arch (oriented horizontally with the opening facing down) is the base. An orange triangular block is on top of the arch.\n    *   **Right Structure:** The base consists of two orange cylinders standing vertically side-by-side.  A yellow rectangular block (oriented horizontally) is placed on top of the cylinders. On top of the yellow block, there is a single orange cylinder, another orange cylinder, and a small orange triangle on top. The red arch is placed with the opening facing down, and the yellow semi-circle is placed on top of the arch and cylinder, then topped by the orange triangle block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices and Counts:**\n    *   Block 1: 1 (Red Arch)\n    *   Block 2: 1 (Red Arch)\n    *   Block 6: 1 (Yellow Horizontal Rectangle)\n    *   Block 9: 4 (Orange Vertical Cylinder)\n    *   Block 11: 1 (Yellow Semi-Circle)\n    *   Block 14: 2 (Orange Triangle)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere is the step-by-step assembly sequence based on the selected blocks:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

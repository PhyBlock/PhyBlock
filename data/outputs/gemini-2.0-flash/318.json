Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure is composed of 13 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** There are approximately 3-4 layers in different parts of the structure.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   **Left Structure:** A green triangular block (left) and a green rectangular block (right) form the base layer. An orange cylinder sits on these blocks.  An orange triangular block rests on the right green rectangular block. A red rectangular block with a half-cylinder cut out is on top of the cylinder. Another orange triangular block rests on the top of the red block.\n    *   **Right Structure:** It consists of 3 red rectangular blocks with half-cylinder cutouts and a blue cube in the middle. There is a green cube below it.\n\n**2. Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the image and the analysis, here are the block indices needed from the dictionary:\n\n*   Red rectangular block with half-cylinder cutout (top of the left structure): Block 1\n*   Red rectangular blocks with half-cylinder cutout (right structure): Block 1, Block 1\n*   Blue cube: Block 4\n*   Green cube: Block 5\n*   Green rectangular block: Block 9\n*   Orange cylinder: Block 10\n*   Orange triangle block: Block 13, Block 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step instruction set to assemble the structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

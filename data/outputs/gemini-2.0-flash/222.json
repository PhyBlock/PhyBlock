Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure is composed of 9 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** We can identify 4 layers in the combined structure, but two separate structures. The first structure (left) has 2 layers, and the second structure (right) has 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   **Left Structure:** A red block (with a curved top) is on the bottom layer, and a blue cube is on top of it. There are two red curved blocks laying side-by-side.\n    *   **Right Structure:** A yellow rectangular block is on the bottom. Two orange cylindrical blocks are on top of it. Another yellow rectangular block is on top of the cylinders. A red arch block is on top of the yellow block. An orange triangular prism block is on top of the red arch block.\n\n**2. Selection of Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the target image, we need the following blocks and their indices:\n\n*   Red curved block (horizontal): Index 2 (used twice)\n*   Blue cube: Index 6\n*   Yellow rectangular block (horizontal): Index 9 (used twice)\n*   Orange Cylinder (vertical): Index 12 (used twice)\n*   Red arch block: Index 2\n*   Orange triangular prism: Index 14\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere are the step-by-step instructions to build the structure, starting with the left, and moving to the right structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n"

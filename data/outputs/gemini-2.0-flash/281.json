Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure is composed of 21 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** It appears to have a maximum of 5 layers in the left part and 4 layers in the right part.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:** The leftmost section looks like a small house. It has a base of 4 blocks: two orange triangle blocks (left and right) and a yellow and a circle block in the middle. Above this base is a layer of orange triangle blocks angled toward the middle above the yellow block, an orange flat block above the left orange triangle and a blue square block on top. On top of the blue block is an orange triangle block.\n    *   **Right Structure:** The right section is a tower atop an archway base. The base consists of three red arches next to each other and then two green blocks above them. Above that is a green arch block rotated 90 degrees so that it is vertical. On top are two yellow blocks and an orange triangle on top.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the list of block indices needed, with repetitions as required:\n\n*   Block 1: 3 times (Red arch)\n*   Block 4: 1 time (Blue Cube)\n*   Block 5: 2 times (Green Cube)\n*   Block 7: 2 times (Yellow Cube)\n*   Block 10: 1 time (Green Arch)\n*   Block 11: 1 time (Yellow Rectangle)\n*   Block 13: 4 times (Orange Triangle - Left side)\n*   Block 14: 2 times (Orange Block)\n*   Block 15: 1 time (Orange Triangle - Top Right)\n*   Block 2: 1 time (Red Circle)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a possible assembly sequence:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step17\": \"Move block with index 7\"\n}\n```"

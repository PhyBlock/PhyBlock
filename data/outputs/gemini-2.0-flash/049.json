Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks and appears to have 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two green rectangular blocks placed vertically.\n    *   The middle layer has two yellow rectangular blocks placed vertically, with a red cube in between.\n    *   The top layer has one green rectangular block placed horizontally.\n    *   The vertical yellow rectangular blocks are placed on top of the two green rectangular blocks.\n    *   The horizontal green rectangular block is placed on top of the two yellow rectangular blocks.\n    *   The red cube is inside of the opening created by the green and yellow blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Based on the image, we need the following blocks:\n    *   Green rectangular block (Vertical orientation): Block index 9 (x2)\n    *   Yellow rectangular block (Vertical orientation): Block index 13 (x2)\n    *   Red cube: Block index 4 (x1)\n    *   Green rectangular block (Horizontal orientation): Block index 6 (x1)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the selected blocks, here's a possible assembly sequence:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Assembly Order:**\n\n1.  Place the first vertical green rectangular block (index 9) to form the base.\n2.  Place the second vertical green rectangular block (index 9) next to the first, completing the base.\n3.  Place the first vertical yellow rectangular block (index 13) on top of one of the green blocks.\n4.  Place the second vertical yellow rectangular block (index 13) on top of the other green block.\n5.  Place the red cube (index 4) in between the two yellow blocks.\n6.  Place the horizontal green rectangular block (index 6) on top of the two yellow blocks to complete the structure.\n"

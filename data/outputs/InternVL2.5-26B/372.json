    "instruction": "<IMG_CONTEXT><IMG_CONTEXT>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

Yellow rectangular block (horizontal) - Index 7\n2. Yellow rectangular block (horizontal) - Index 13\n3. Red rectangular block with arch (horizontal) - Index 1\n4. Red rectangular block with arch (horizontal) - Index 2\n5. Blue rectangular block (horizontal) - Index 5\n6. Red rectangular block (horizontal) - Index 6\n7. Orange triangular block (horizontal) - Index 15\n8. Green rectangular block (horizontal) - Index 9\n9. Green rectangular block (horizontal) - Index 10\n10. Orange triangular block (horizontal) - Index 16\n\n## Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures the structure is built layer by layer, starting from the base and progressing to the top."

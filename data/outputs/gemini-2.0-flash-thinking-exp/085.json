Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **9 blocks** in total.\n    - The structure has **6 layers**.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of a yellow rectangular block laid horizontally at the base. On top of this, two red semi-circular blocks are placed vertically side-by-side forming a cylinder shape.\n    - **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the red semi-circular blocks, perpendicular to the base yellow block. On top of this, two more red semi-circular blocks are placed vertically side-by-side, continuing the cylinder shape upwards.\n    - **Layer 3:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the second layer of red semi-circular blocks, aligned in the same direction as the yellow block in Layer 1.\n    - **Layer 4:** A blue square block is placed centrally on top of the yellow rectangular block in Layer 3.\n    - **Layer 5:** A green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the blue square block, oriented in the same direction as the yellow blocks in Layers 1 and 3.\n    - **Layer 6 (Top):** An orange triangular roof block is placed centrally on top of the green rectangular block in Layer 5.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the red semi-circular blocks (vertical): **Block 1** (needed 4 times)\n    - For the yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal, thin): **Block 9** (needed 3 times)\n    - For the blue square block: **Block 4** (needed 1 time)\n    - For the green rectangular block (horizontal, thin): **Block 7** (needed 1 time)\n    - For the orange triangular roof block: **Block 14** (needed 1 time)\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 9, 9, 4, 7, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {9}\n    Step2: Move block with index {1}\n    Step3: Move block with index {1}\n    Step4: Move block with index {9}\n    Step5: Move block with index {1}\n    Step6: Move block with index {1}\n    Step7: Move block with index {9}\n    Step8: Move block with index {4}\n    Step9: Move block with index {7}\n    Step10: Move block with index {14}\n }"

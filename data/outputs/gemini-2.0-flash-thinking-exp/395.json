Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 10 blocks and has approximately 7 layers in the tower part and 2 layers in the bridge part if we consider each horizontal level as a layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Tower Structure:** A red block forms the base, followed by a yellow rectangular block. A red cylinder block is placed on top of the yellow block, again followed by a yellow rectangular block. A green rectangular block is placed on the second yellow block, topped by another yellow rectangular block. Finally, an orange triangular prism serves as the roof. All these blocks are stacked vertically in the center.\n    *   **Bridge Structure:** Two red arch-shaped blocks are placed side-by-side to act as supports. A long yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of these two supports, creating a bridge. The bridge structure is located to the right and slightly in front of the tower structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red base block (tower & bridge support): Index 1 (used three times)\n    *   Yellow rectangular block (tower layer 2, 4, 6): Index 8 (used three times)\n    *   Red cylinder block (tower): Index 2 (used once)\n    *   Green rectangular block (tower): Index 5 (used once)\n    *   Orange triangular prism (tower roof): Index 15 (used once)\n    *   Yellow long rectangular block (bridge top): Index 7 (used once)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 8, 2, 8, 5, 8, 15, 1, 1, 7\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {1}\n    Step2: Move block with index {8}\n    Step3: Move block with index {2}\n    Step4: Move block with index {8}\n    Step5: Move block with index {5}\n    Step6: Move block with index {8}\n    Step7: Move block with index {15}\n    Step8: Move block with index {1}\n    Step9: Move block with index {1}\n    Step10: Move block with index {7}\n}"

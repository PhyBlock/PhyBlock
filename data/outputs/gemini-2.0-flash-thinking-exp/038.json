The bottom block is placed on the ground, and the top block is placed directly on top of the bottom block, aligned perfectly to create a cylindrical hole in the center. The semi-circular cut-out of the bottom block faces upwards, and the semi-circular cut-out of the top block faces downwards, creating a complete circle when combined.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks:** We need two blocks with a semi-circular cut-out to form a cylinder when stacked. Both blocks must be red and have the correct orientation.\n- **Block Indices:**\n    - For the **bottom layer**, we need a block with the semi-circular cut-out facing upwards. Looking at the Block Dictionary, **Block 2** matches this description in terms of shape, color, and orientation.\n    - For the **top layer**, we need a block with the semi-circular cut-out facing downwards. Looking at the Block Dictionary, **Block 7** matches this description in terms of shape, color, and orientation.\n- **List Block Indices:** 2, 7\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n- **Inference of Order:** To build the structure, we should first place the bottom block and then place the top block on it.\n- **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\"\n}\n```"

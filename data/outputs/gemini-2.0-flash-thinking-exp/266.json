Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of two separate parts.\n    - **Left Structure:** Consists of 5 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    - **Right Structure:** Consists of 4 blocks and has 2 layers.\n    - **Total Blocks:** 9 blocks in total across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Left Structure:**\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A blue cube forms the base.\n        - **Layer 2 (Middle):** A yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the blue cube, slightly shifted to the right. A green cube is placed adjacent to the yellow block on its left side, on the same layer as the yellow block. A small red rectangular block is placed adjacent to the green cube on its left side, on the same layer.\n        - **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange triangular prism is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, centered.\n\n    - **Right Structure:**\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side to form the base.\n        - **Layer 2 (Top):** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across and on top of the two red arch blocks. Two more red arch blocks are placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, aligned with the base arch blocks below.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the **Left Structure**:\n        - Blue Cube: Index 6\n        - Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal orientation): Index 10\n        - Green Cube: Index 7\n        - Red Small Rectangular Block: Index 8\n        - Orange Triangular Prism: Index 15\n\n    - For the **Right Structure**:\n        - Red Arch Block (wider arch): Index 1 (used four times)\n        - Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal orientation, shorter length): Index 9\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 9\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n}"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **8 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 3 red curved blocks arranged in a row, forming an arch-like base.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 4 blocks: 2 yellow rectangular blocks placed on top of the bottom layer, and 2 red curved blocks placed on top of the yellow blocks, forming a circular opening.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 1 yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the middle layer's red curved blocks.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - The bottom layer acts as a base, with three curved red blocks placed adjacently.\n    - The middle layer is built upon the bottom layer. Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side on top of the base. Two red curved blocks are placed on top of the yellow blocks, positioned facing each other to create a circular hole.\n    - The top layer rests on the middle layer, with a single yellow rectangular block spanning across the red curved blocks of the layer below.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the bottom layer, we need 3 red curved blocks that are oriented like index **2**.\n    - For the middle layer, we need 2 yellow rectangular blocks oriented horizontally like index **10**.\n    - For the middle layer's circular part, we need 1 red curved block oriented like index **5** and 1 red curved block oriented like index **6** to create the circular opening.\n    - For the top layer, we need 1 yellow rectangular block oriented horizontally like index **10**.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 2, 10, 10, 5, 6, 10\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n}"

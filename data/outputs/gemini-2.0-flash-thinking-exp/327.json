Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Structure on the Left:**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 7 blocks and has 2 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):**\n        - A green rectangular prism is placed horizontally at the base.\n        - Two orange rectangular prisms are placed vertically, one on each side of the horizontal green prism.\n    - **Layer 2 (Top Layer):**\n        - A green rectangular prism is placed vertically on top of the central horizontal green prism of the layer below.\n        - Three orange triangular prisms are placed on top, forming a roof shape. Two triangular prisms are placed on the vertical orange rectangular prisms and lean towards the central vertical green prism. The third triangular prism is placed centrally on top of the vertical green prism, connecting the other two triangular prisms.\n\n**Structure on the Right:**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 4 blocks and has 2 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):**\n        - A green rectangular prism is placed horizontally as the base.\n        - An orange cylinder is placed vertically on top of the horizontal green prism.\n    - **Layer 2 (Top Layer):**\n        - A green rectangular prism is placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinder, oriented perpendicularly to the base green prism.\n        - Another orange cylinder is placed vertically between the top green prism and the base green prism, acting as a support.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**For Structure on the Left:**\n- Horizontal Green Rectangular Prism (Bottom Layer Base): **Index 1**\n- Vertical Orange Rectangular Prism (Bottom Layer Sides - x2): **Index 9** (Used twice)\n- Vertical Green Rectangular Prism (Top Layer Middle): **Index 2**\n- Orange Triangular Prism (Roof - x3): **Index 12** (Used three times)\n\n**For Structure on the Right:**\n- Horizontal Green Rectangular Prism (Bottom Layer Base): **Index 5**\n- Vertical Orange Cylinder (Bottom Layer): **Index 6**\n- Horizontal Green Rectangular Prism (Top Layer): **Index 1**\n- Vertical Orange Cylinder (Support): **Index 6**\n\n**List of Block Indices for both structures (in order of appearance from left to right in target image):**\nStructure Left: 1, 9, 9, 2, 12, 12, 12\nStructure Right: 5, 6, 1, 6\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure on the Left:**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure on the Right:**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n}\n```"

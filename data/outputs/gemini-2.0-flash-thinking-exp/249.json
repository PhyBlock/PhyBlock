Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n\n**Description of the structure in the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image displays two distinct structures composed of building blocks.\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- **Block Count:** 3 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n- **Bottom Layer:** A red block with a curved top edge, oriented vertically.\n- **Middle Layer:** A green rectangular block, oriented horizontally, placed directly on top of the red block from the bottom layer.\n- **Top Layer:** A red block with a curved bottom edge, oriented vertically, placed directly on top of the green block from the middle layer.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The green rectangular block is sandwiched between two red blocks. The curved edges of the red blocks face inwards, creating a semi-circular opening in the middle.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Block Count:** 5 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers (considering the base as the first layer)\n- **Bottom Layer:** Two orange cylinder blocks, placed side-by-side horizontally and parallel to each other, forming the base.\n- **Middle Layer:** A yellow rectangular block, oriented horizontally, placed on top of and across the two orange cylinder blocks.\n- **Top Layer (Overlapping Middle Layer):** A yellow curved block, oriented horizontally, placed on the front half of the yellow rectangular block and extending slightly beyond its front edge.\n- **Topmost Layer:** A blue cube block, placed on top of the yellow curved block, towards the front edge.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The orange cylinders form a base. The yellow rectangular block sits on this base. The yellow curved block is positioned on the front part of the rectangular block, and the blue cube is placed on top of the curved block at the front.\n\n## 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**Block Indices for Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Bottom Red Curved Block: Index 2\n- Middle Green Rectangular Block: Index 8\n- Top Red Curved Block: Index 1\n\n**Block Indices for Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Orange Cylinder Block (x2): Index 13 (used twice)\n- Yellow Rectangular Block: Index 11\n- Yellow Curved Block: Index 12\n- Blue Cube Block: Index 6\n\n**List of Block Indices (for both structures):** 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 13\n\n## 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 6\n}"

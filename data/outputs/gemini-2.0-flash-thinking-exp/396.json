Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure on the right in the main target image is composed of **4 blocks** and has **2 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Consists of three blocks: two orange cylinders standing vertically and one yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the cylinders.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Top):** Consists of one orange triangular prism placed on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two orange cylindrical blocks are placed vertically, side-by-side, forming the base supports.\n    *   A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across the top of the two cylinders, connecting them.\n    *   An orange triangular prism is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, roughly in the center.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the two vertical orange cylinders: **Block index 7** (used twice).\n    *   For the horizontal yellow rectangular block: **Block index 4**.\n    *   For the orange triangular prism: **Block index 11**.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 4, 11\n\n*   **Matching Criteria Verification:**\n    *   **Shape:** The shapes (cylinder, rectangular block, triangular prism) are correctly identified and matched to the dictionary.\n    *   **Color:** The colors (orange and yellow) are correctly identified and matched to the dictionary.\n    *   **Rotational Orientation:** The chosen blocks (index 7 for vertical cylinders, index 4 for horizontal rectangle, index 11 for the triangular prism in its shown orientation) from the dictionary match the orientations required in the main target image without any need for rotation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** To build the structure, we should start with the base and move upwards layer by layer. First, place the two cylindrical blocks, then the rectangular block on top, and finally the triangular prism.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```"

The left block is yellow, and the right block is red.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):**  A single, horizontally oriented green rectangular block is placed on top of and spanning across both blocks from the first layer.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Two orange triangular prism blocks form a roof shape on top of the green rectangular block. They are placed adjacent to each other, meeting at the peak of the roof.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - The yellow and red cubic blocks are adjacent to each other on the bottom layer.\n    - The green rectangular block is placed directly above and centered on the yellow and red blocks.\n    - The two orange triangular prisms are placed on top of the green block, forming a roof. One prism is on the left side, and the other is on the right side, creating a sloped roof.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\n\n- For the yellow cube (bottom layer, left): **Block index 4**\n- For the red cube (bottom layer, right): **Block index 3**\n- For the horizontal green rectangular block (middle layer): **Block index 6**\n- For the left orange triangular prism (top layer, left roof): **Block index 14**\n- For the right orange triangular prism (top layer, right roof): **Block index 15**\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```"

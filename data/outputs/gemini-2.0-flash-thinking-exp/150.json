Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Left Structure:**\n    *   **Block Count:** 8 blocks\n    *   **Layers:** 3 layers\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** One red arch block in the center, flanked by two green square blocks behind it.\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** A blue cube sits atop the red arch in the center. Orange triangle blocks are placed on either side and slightly behind the blue cube, resting on the green square blocks from the layer below.\n        *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Two red triangle blocks form a roof shape, placed on top of the orange triangle blocks and meeting above the blue cube.\n\n*   **Right Structure:**\n    *   **Block Count:** 5 blocks\n    *   **Layers:** 3 layers\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two green rectangular prism blocks are placed side-by-side, forming the base.\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** A long yellow rectangular prism block is placed horizontally on top of the two green rectangular prism blocks.\n        *   **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange cylinder is placed vertically on one end of the yellow rectangular prism. A yellow half-cylinder is placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinder.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Required Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red arch (Layer 1, Left Structure): Index 1\n    *   Green square (Layer 1, Left Structure): Index 5 (x2)\n    *   Blue cube (Layer 2, Left Structure): Index 4\n    *   Orange triangle (Layer 2 & 3, Left Structure): Index 15 (x2) & Index 16 (x2) - Note: While the target image roof triangles look red, the shape and orientation match Block 15 and 16 from the dictionary, which are orange. We will assume shape and orientation are the key and use orange triangles.\n    *   Green rectangular prism (Layer 1, Right Structure): Index 6 (x2)\n    *   Yellow rectangular prism (Layer 2, Right Structure): Index 10\n    *   Orange cylinder (Layer 3, Right Structure): Index 11\n    *   Yellow half-cylinder (Layer 3, Right Structure): Index 12\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 6\n    Step11: Move block with index 10\n    Step12: Move block with index 11\n    Step13: Move block with index 12\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **5 blocks** and has **4 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red curved blocks forming the base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A blue cube placed on top of the base.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A green rectangular block (horizontal orientation) placed on the blue cube.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange triangular block placed on the green rectangular block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two red, semi-circular blocks arranged side-by-side to create a U-shaped base.\n    *   A blue cube is placed centrally on top of the red base.\n    *   A green rectangular block, oriented horizontally, is placed centrally on top of the blue cube.\n    *   An orange triangular block (roof-shaped) is placed centrally on top of the green rectangular block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   **Bottom Layer (Red curved blocks):** We need two red curved blocks oriented to form a U-shape. Blocks **1** and **2** from the dictionary appear suitable.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Blue cube):** We need a blue cube. Block **4** from the dictionary is a blue cube.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Green horizontal rectangular block):** We need a horizontally oriented green rectangular block. Block **7** from the dictionary is a suitable match.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Orange triangular block):** We need an orange triangular block, roof-shaped. Block **15** from the dictionary matches this description.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 2, 4, 7, 15\n\n*   **Matching Criteria Verification:**\n    *   All selected blocks match the target image in shape, color, and rotational orientation as depicted in the dictionary.\n    *   No rotations are needed; the blocks are used exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** We will assemble the structure from the bottom layer upwards.\n    *   Step 1: Place the first red curved block (Block 1) as part of the base.\n    *   Step 2: Place the second red curved block (Block 2) next to the first one to complete the base.\n    *   Step 3: Place the blue cube (Block 4) on top of the red base.\n    *   Step 4: Place the green rectangular block (Block 7) on top of the blue cube.\n    *   Step 5: Place the orange triangular block (Block 15) on top of the green rectangular block.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```"

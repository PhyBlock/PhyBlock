A red curved block is placed in the center of this square. A yellow cube is placed adjacent to the right side of the red curved block, within the square base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A green cube is positioned on top of the left side of the red curved block and partially overlapping with the orange trapezoidal blocks of the layer below. A blue cube is positioned on top of the yellow cube and the right side of the red curved block, also partially overlapping with the orange trapezoidal blocks below.\n    *   **Layer 3:** Two orange trapezoidal blocks are placed on top of the green and blue cubes, forming a sloped roof. They are oriented to meet at the top center, creating a peak.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Curved Block (Center Base): Index **1**\n    *   Yellow Cube (Right Base): Index **9**\n    *   Orange Trapezoidal Block (Bottom Right Base): Index **16**\n    *   Orange Trapezoidal Block (Top Right Base): Index **15**\n    *   Orange Trapezoidal Block (Top Left Base): Index **14**\n    *   Orange Trapezoidal Block (Bottom Left Base): Index **13**\n    *   Green Cube (Left Middle): Index **7**\n    *   Blue Cube (Right Middle): Index **6**\n    *   Orange Trapezoidal Block (Left Top): Index **11**\n    *   Orange Trapezoidal Block (Right Top): Index **12**\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```"

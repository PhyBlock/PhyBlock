Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe Main Target Image displays two distinct structures:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Tower):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 6 blocks and has 4 layers.\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): Two red arch blocks forming a base.\n    - Layer 2: One yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the arches.\n    - Layer 3: One green rectangular block placed vertically on top of the yellow block.\n    - Layer 4 (Top): One yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the green block, and an orange triangular block placed on top of the yellow block, towards one end.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - The two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side at the base.\n    - The yellow horizontal rectangular block in Layer 2 sits directly on top of the two arch blocks, spanning across them.\n    - The green vertical rectangular block in Layer 3 is centered on top of the yellow block from Layer 2.\n    - The yellow horizontal rectangular block in Layer 4 is centered on top of the green block from Layer 3.\n    - The orange triangular block is positioned on top of the yellow block in Layer 4, towards one side, creating a peaked top.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Arch with Inner Blocks):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 4 blocks and has 3 effective layers (considering inner blocks as separate layers within the arch structure).\n    - Layer 1 & 2 (Arch): Two red arch blocks stacked vertically to form an arch shape.\n    - Layer 3 (Inner Bottom): One green cube block placed inside the arch, resting on the lower arch block.\n    - Layer 4 (Inner Top): One blue cube block placed inside the arch, on top of the green cube block.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - The two red arch blocks are stacked directly on top of each other to create the arch shape.\n    - The green cube block is positioned within the cavity of the arch structure, resting on the bottom red arch block.\n    - The blue cube block is positioned directly on top of the green cube block, also within the cavity of the arch structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**For Structure 1 (Left Tower):**\n- Base Arches (Layer 1): Block 1 (Red Arch - right orientation) and Block 2 (Red Arch - left orientation).\n- Layer 2 Yellow Rectangle: Block 9 (Yellow Rectangle - horizontal orientation).\n- Layer 3 Green Rectangle: Block 7 (Green Rectangle - vertical orientation).\n- Layer 4 Yellow Rectangle: Block 9 (Yellow Rectangle - horizontal orientation).\n- Top Orange Triangle: Block 13 (Orange Triangle - standard orientation).\n\n**For Structure 2 (Right Arch with Inner Blocks):**\n- Arch Blocks: Block 1 (Red Arch - right orientation) - used twice.\n- Inner Green Cube: Block 6 (Green Cube).\n- Inner Blue Cube: Block 5 (Blue Cube).\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\nFor Structure 1: 2, 1, 9, 7, 9, 13\nFor Structure 2: 1, 1, 6, 5\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the assembly order to construct both structures would be:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n\n**Tall Structure (Left):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 7 blocks and has 3 distinct layers.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 blocks: a horizontal green rectangular block forming the base, and an orange cylinder placed centrally on top of it.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 blocks: a horizontal yellow rectangular block placed on top of the cylinder, and a vertical green rectangular block placed upright on the yellow block, slightly off-center to create an opening.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 3 blocks: a horizontal yellow rectangular block placed on top of the vertical green block to complete the frame, another vertical green rectangular block placed inside the frame, and an orange triangular block placed on top of the inner vertical green block, within the frame.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - The orange cylinder is placed on top of the green rectangular base.\n    - The horizontal yellow block sits on the cylinder.\n    - The vertical green block stands on the yellow block, forming one side of a frame.\n    - Another horizontal yellow block closes the frame at the top.\n    - A vertical green block is placed inside the frame, standing on the lower yellow block.\n    - The orange triangle rests on the inner vertical green block, within the frame.\n\n**Bridge-like Structure (Right):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 12 blocks and has 3 distinct layers.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 3 red arch blocks placed side-by-side to form the base of the bridge.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 3 yellow half-cylinder blocks, each placed on top of a red arch block, forming the curved supports of the bridge.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 6 blocks placed across the yellow half-cylinders, forming the bridge's deck: From left to right: an orange cube, a vertical green rectangular block, two vertical yellow rectangular blocks, a blue cube, and another orange cube.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - Three red arch blocks are placed adjacently to form a row.\n    - Yellow half-cylinders are placed on top of each red arch.\n    - On top of the yellow half-cylinders, blocks are arranged linearly: orange cube, green rectangle, yellow rectangle, yellow rectangle, blue cube, orange cube.\n\n## 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**Tall Structure Blocks:**\n- Green rectangular base (horizontal): Index **7**\n- Orange cylinder: Index **13**\n- Yellow rectangular horizontal (middle and top): Index **10** (used twice)\n- Green rectangular vertical (frame and inner): Index **8** (used twice)\n- Orange triangle: Index **16**\n\n**Bridge-like Structure Blocks:**\n- Red arch (3): Index **1**, **2**, **3**\n- Yellow half-cylinder (3): Index **14** (used three times)\n- Orange cube (2): Index **5** (used twice)\n- Green rectangular vertical: Index **8**\n- Yellow rectangular vertical (2): Index **11** (used twice)\n- Blue cube: Index **4**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 7, 13, 10, 8, 10, 8, 16, 1, 2, 3, 14, 14, 14, 5, 8, 11, 11, 4, 5\n\n## 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step17\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step18\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step19\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Tall Structure):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 9 blocks and has 4 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Three yellow rectangular blocks are laid horizontally side-by-side forming the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** Two green rectangular blocks are placed vertically on top of the two outer yellow blocks from the layer below.\n    - **Layer 3:** Two orange cylindrical blocks are placed vertically on top of the green blocks. A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across the top of the two green blocks and between the two cylindrical blocks, bridging the gap.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange triangular prism is placed on top of the central yellow rectangular block from the layer below.\n\n**Structure 2 (Small House-like Structure):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 4 blocks and has 2 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Three cube blocks are placed side-by-side in a row: red, yellow, and green, from left to right.\n    - **Layer 2 (Top):** An orange triangular prism is placed on top of the three cube blocks, forming a roof-like shape.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**For Structure 1 (Tall Structure):**\n- Layer 1 (Yellow Rectangular Horizontal): Block index **8** (used 3 times)\n- Layer 2 (Green Rectangular Vertical): Block index **6** (used 2 times)\n- Layer 3 (Orange Cylinder Vertical): Block index **9** (used 2 times)\n- Layer 3 (Yellow Rectangular Horizontal): Block index **8** (used 1 time)\n- Layer 4 (Orange Triangular Prism): Block index **13** (used 1 time)\n\n**For Structure 2 (Small House-like Structure):**\n- Layer 1 (Red Cube): Block index **3** (used 1 time)\n- Layer 1 (Yellow Cube): Block index **4** (used 1 time)\n- Layer 1 (Green Cube): Block index **1** (used 1 time)\n- Layer 2 (Orange Triangular Prism): Block index **14** (used 1 time)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 9, 9, 8, 13, 3, 4, 1, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index {8}\n  Step2: Move block with index {8}\n  Step3: Move block with index {8}\n  Step4: Move block with index {6}\n  Step5: Move block with index {6}\n  Step6: Move block with index {9}\n  Step7: Move block with index {9}\n  Step8: Move block with index {8}\n  Step9: Move block with index {13}\n  Step10: Move block with index {3}\n  Step11: Move block with index {4}\n  Step12: Move block with index {1}\n  Step13: Move block with index {14}\n}"

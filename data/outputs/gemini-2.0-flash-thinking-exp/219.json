Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of two separate parts.\n    - **Left Part:**\n        - Contains 8 blocks.\n        - Has 3 layers.\n            - Layer 1 (Bottom): 4 orange cylinders.\n            - Layer 2 (Middle): 1 yellow cuboid.\n            - Layer 3 (Top): 1 orange triangular prism, 1 yellow cylinder, 1 yellow half-cylinder.\n    - **Right Part:**\n        - Contains 4 blocks.\n        - Has 2 layers.\n            - Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 red arches.\n            - Layer 2 (Top): 2 green cuboids.\n    - **Total Blocks in the Entire Structure:** 12 blocks.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Left Part:**\n        - The base layer consists of four orange cylinders arranged in a square formation.\n        - A yellow cuboid is placed horizontally on top of these four cylinders, spanning across them.\n        - On the yellow cuboid:\n            - A yellow cylinder is placed on the left side.\n            - A yellow half-cylinder is placed on top of the yellow cylinder.\n            - An orange triangular prism is placed on the right side.\n    - **Right Part:**\n        - The base layer consists of two red arches placed side-by-side horizontally.\n        - On top of the red arches, two green cuboids are placed horizontally adjacent to each other.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Red Arch (for Right Part, bottom layer): Index 2 (needed 2 times)\n    - Green Cuboid (for Right Part, top layer): Index 6 (needed 2 times)\n    - Orange Cylinder (for Left Part, bottom layer): Index 8 (needed 4 times)\n    - Yellow Cuboid (for Left Part, middle layer): Index 7 (needed 1 time)\n    - Yellow Cylinder (for Left Part, top layer): Index 11 (needed 1 time)\n    - Yellow Half-Cylinder (for Left Part, top layer): Index 10 (needed 1 time)\n    - Orange Triangular Prism (for Left Part, top layer): Index 15 (needed 1 time)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 11, 10, 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n    Step11: Move block with index 10\n    Step12: Move block with index 15\n}\n```"

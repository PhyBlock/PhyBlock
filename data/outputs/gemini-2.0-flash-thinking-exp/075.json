Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **9 blocks** in total.\n    - It has **3 layers**:\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 4 orange cylinder blocks.\n        - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 yellow rectangular blocks.\n        - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 2 red arch blocks and 1 red triangular block.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1:** Four orange cylinder blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side, forming a rectangular base. They appear to be arranged in two rows of two, creating a wider base.\n    - **Layer 2:** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinders. They are placed adjacent to each other, covering the row of cylinders below.\n    - **Layer 3:** Two red arch blocks are placed on top of the yellow rectangular blocks, side-by-side. A single red triangular block is placed on top of and centered above the two arch blocks, forming a roof-like structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For Layer 1 (Orange Cylinders): We need 4 blocks of index **12**.\n    - For Layer 2 (Yellow Rectangular Blocks): We need 2 blocks of index **7**.\n    - For Layer 3 (Red Arch Blocks): We need 2 blocks of index **1**.\n    - For Layer 3 (Red Triangular Block): We need 1 block of index **14**.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 12, 12, 12, 12, 7, 7, 1, 1, 14\n\n- **Matching Criteria:** All selected block indices correspond to blocks in the dictionary that match the shape, color, and rotational orientation of the blocks in the Main Target Image. Specifically:\n    - Index 12 is a horizontally oriented orange cylinder.\n    - Index 7 is a horizontally oriented yellow rectangular block.\n    - Index 1 is a red arch block in the correct orientation.\n    - Index 14 is a red triangular block in the correct orientation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n- **Inference of Order:** We will assemble the structure layer by layer, starting from the bottom.\n\n- **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

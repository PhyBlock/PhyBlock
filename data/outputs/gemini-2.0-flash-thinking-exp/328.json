Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **11 blocks**.\n    - It has **4 layers**.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of 3 green rectangular blocks laid horizontally side-by-side.\n    - **Layer 2:** Consists of 1 red arch block placed in the center, with 2 green rectangular blocks placed on either side of the arch and on top of the base layer's green blocks, and 1 blue cube placed on the right side on top of the green rectangular block.\n    - **Layer 3:** Consists of 1 blue cube placed on top of the red arch block, and 2 orange triangular prism blocks placed on either side of the blue cube, resting on the green rectangular blocks of the second layer.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top Layer):** Consists of 1 orange triangular prism block placed on top of the blue cube from the third layer.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - The structure is built on a base of three horizontal green rectangular blocks.\n    - The red arch block spans across the middle green block of the base layer.\n    - The blue cube in layer 2 is placed to the right side.\n    - The top blue cube is centrally placed above the arch.\n    - The orange triangular prisms are placed symmetrically on the third layer and then a single one on top.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Green Rectangular Block (horizontal): **Block 7** (Needed 5 times)\n    - Red Arch Block: **Block 1** (Needed 1 time)\n    - Blue Cube: **Block 3** (Needed 2 times)\n    - Orange Triangular Prism Block (slanted right): **Block 12** (Needed 3 times)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {7}\n    Step2: Move block with index {7}\n    Step3: Move block with index {7}\n    Step4: Move block with index {1}\n    Step5: Move block with index {7}\n    Step6: Move block with index {7}\n    Step7: Move block with index {3}\n    Step8: Move block with index {3}\n    Step9: Move block with index {12}\n    Step10: Move block with index {12}\n    Step11: Move block with index {12}\n}"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Left Structure:**\n    * **Count & Layers:** 3 blocks, 3 layers (bottom to top visually).\n    * **Spatial Relationships:**\n        * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A horizontal green rectangular block forms the base.\n        * **Layer 2 (Middle):** An orange cylinder is placed vertically on top of the center of the green rectangular block.\n        * **Layer 3 (Top):** A vertical green L-shaped block is placed on top of the orange cylinder, aligned such that the longer part of the 'L' is oriented vertically upwards.\n\n* **Right Structure:**\n    * **Count & Layers:** 6 blocks, 3 layers (bottom to top visually).\n    * **Spatial Relationships:**\n        * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red curved blocks are placed side-by-side, forming a roughly circular base with a gap in the middle. The curve of one block faces right, and the curve of the other faces left, creating an enclosed shape.\n        * **Layer 2 (Middle):** Two orange triangular blocks are placed on top of the red curved blocks, one on each. They are oriented with their flat bases down and slanted sides facing inwards/upwards to meet in the center.\n        * **Layer 3 (Top):** A yellow semi-circular block is placed on top of the two orange triangular blocks, spanning across them and completing the top of the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Left Structure:**\n    * Green Rectangular Block (horizontal): Index 5\n    * Orange Cylinder Block (vertical): Index 9\n    * Green L-shaped Block (vertical): Index 6\n\n* **Right Structure:**\n    * Red Curved Block (curved right): Index 1\n    * Red Curved Block (curved left): Index 2\n    * Orange Triangle Block (slant right): Index 13\n    * Orange Triangle Block (slant left): Index 14\n    * Yellow Semi-circular Block: Index 10\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n* **Left Structure Assembly Order:**\n   ```json\n   {\n      \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n      \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n      \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n* **Right Structure Assembly Order:**\n   ```json\n   {\n      \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n      \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n      \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n      \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n      \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n   }\n   ```"

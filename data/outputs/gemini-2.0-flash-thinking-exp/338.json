It can be seen as having a maximum of 4 layers in height, considering the tallest part of the structure. We can differentiate two sub-structures:\n        - **Left Structure:** This part resembles a chair and consists of 7 blocks arranged in 4 layers. The base layer is formed by orange cylinders, the second layer by yellow rectangular blocks, the third layer by a green rectangular block, and the top layer by a yellow semi-cylinder.\n        - **Right Structure:** This part is smaller and consists of 3 blocks in 2 layers. The base layer is formed by red curved blocks, and the top layer is a blue cube.\n    - **Spatial Relationships:**\n        - **Left Structure:** Three orange cylinders are placed side-by-side on the ground forming a horizontal base. Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally adjacent on top of the cylinders, creating a platform. A green rectangular block is placed vertically on top of the yellow platform, approximately in the center. A yellow semi-cylinder is placed horizontally on top of the green block at one end.\n        - **Right Structure:** Two red curved blocks are placed next to each other with their curved parts facing upwards, forming a cradle-like shape. A blue cube is placed on top of these red curved blocks, centered above them.\n        - The left and right structures are positioned separately on the ground plane, not directly connected to each other but within the same scene.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n    - **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n        - Red Curved Block (x2): Index 1\n        - Blue Cube (x1): Index 4\n        - Orange Cylinder (x3): Index 12\n        - Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal) (x2): Index 10\n        - Green Rectangular Block (vertical) (x1): Index 9\n        - Yellow Semi-cylinder (x1): Index 13\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n    ```json\n    {\n       \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n       \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n       \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n       \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n       \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n       \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n       \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n       \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n       \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n       \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n    }\n    ```"

            "text": "## Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:\n\nThe Main Target Image displays two distinct structures built from blocks: a chair and a house.\n\n**Chair Structure:**\n- **Count & Layers:** The chair is composed of 6 blocks in total, arranged in 3 layers.\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): Consists of 4 orange cylinder blocks forming the legs of the chair in a square arrangement.\n    - Layer 2 (Middle):  Comprises 2 yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the cylinder legs, forming the seat.\n    - Layer 3 (Top):  Features a green rectangular block placed vertically on the seat as the backrest, and a yellow semi-cylinder block placed horizontally on top of the backrest.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The four orange cylinders are positioned at the corners to support the chair. The two yellow rectangular blocks are placed adjacent to each other, spanning across the cylinders to create a flat seat. The green rectangular block is placed centrally on the seat, standing upright. The yellow semi-cylinder is placed on top of the green block, oriented horizontally.\n\n**House Structure:**\n- **Count & Layers:** The house structure uses 7 blocks and is also composed of 3 layers.\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom):  Consists of 3 green rectangular blocks placed horizontally in a row, forming the base of the house.\n    - Layer 2 (Middle): Features a red arch block placed centrally on the green base, and two orange wedge blocks positioned on either side of the arch on the green base.\n    - Layer 3 (Top):  Includes a blue cube placed on top of the red arch, and two orange wedge blocks placed on top of the blue cube and side orange wedges to create a roof shape.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The three green rectangular blocks are aligned to form the ground level of the house. The red arch is centrally located on this base. The two orange wedge blocks are placed beside the arch, resting on the green base. The blue cube sits directly on top of the arch. The final two orange wedge blocks are arranged to form a pitched roof on top of the blue cube and lower orange wedges.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**For the Chair:**\n- Orange Cylinder (4 blocks): Index **10**\n- Yellow Rectangle Horizontal (2 blocks): Index **8**\n- Green Rectangle Vertical (1 block): Index **7**\n- Yellow Semi-cylinder (1 block): Index **11**\n\n**For the House:**\n- Green Rectangle Horizontal (3 blocks): Index **6**\n- Red Arch Block (1 block): Index **1**\n- Orange Wedge Block (4 blocks): Index **16**\n- Blue Cube (1 block): Index **4**\n\n## Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step17\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

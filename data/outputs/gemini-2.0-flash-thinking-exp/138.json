An orange triangular block is placed at the front left and another at the front right as ramps leading up to the arches.\n      - **Layer 2 (Middle):**\n         - On the left two arches: A yellow semi-cylinder is placed horizontally.\n         - On the third arch from the left: A green cube is placed.\n         - On the fourth arch from the left: An orange rectangular block is placed, and a green rectangular block is placed on top of it.\n      - **Layer 3 (Top):**\n         - On top of the yellow semi-cylinder: A blue cube is placed.\n         - On top of the green cube: A yellow rectangular block is placed in the front, and another yellow rectangular block is placed behind it.\n         - On top of the orange rectangular block: A red house-shaped block is placed in the front, and another red house-shaped block is placed behind it.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n   - **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n      - Red Arch Block: Index 1 (x4)\n      - Orange Triangular Block: Index 14 (x2)\n      - Yellow Semi-cylinder Block: Index 12 (x1)\n      - Green Cube Block: Index 6 (x1)\n      - Orange Rectangular Block: Index 7 (x1)\n      - Green Rectangular Block: Index 8 (x1)\n      - Blue Cube Block: Index 5 (x1)\n      - Yellow Rectangular Block: Index 11 (x2)\n      - Red House-shaped Block: Index 15 (x2)\n   - **Block Indices List:** 1, 1, 1, 1, 14, 14, 12, 6, 7, 8, 5, 11, 11, 15, 15\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n   ```json\n   {\n      \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n      \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n      \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n      \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n      \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n      \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n      \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n      \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n      \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n      \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n      \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n      \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n      \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n      \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n      \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n   }\n   ```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **8 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 3 blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 3 blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 2 blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side, forming the base. A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the center of these two arch blocks, bridging them.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two green cube blocks are positioned on top of the yellow rectangular block, side-by-side and towards the back. A blue rectangular block is placed horizontally on the yellow rectangular block, adjacent to one of the green cubes and towards the front.\n    *   **Layer 3:** An orange wedge block is placed on top of one green cube and the adjacent blue rectangular block. A blue cube block is placed on top of the other green cube.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch Block (Bottom Layer, x2): Index **2** (appears twice in the structure)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Block (Bottom Layer): Index **12**\n    *   Green Cube Block (Middle Layer, x2): Index **5** (appears twice in the structure)\n    *   Blue Rectangular Block (Middle Layer): Index **4**\n    *   Orange Wedge Block (Top Layer): Index **15**\n    *   Blue Cube Block (Top Layer): Index **8**\n\n**3.

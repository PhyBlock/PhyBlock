Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed on top, spanning across both cylinders. A green rectangular block is placed centrally on the yellow blocks, and a red triangular prism sits on top of the green block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n*   **Block Count:** 5 blocks\n*   **Layers:** 3 layers\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Consists of 2 orange cylindrical blocks placed side by side horizontally.\n    *   Layer 2: Consists of 1 yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the cylindrical blocks, spanning across both cylinders.\n    *   Layer 3: Consists of 1 blue cubic block placed on one end of the yellow rectangular block.\n    *   Layer 4 (Top): Consists of 1 red triangular prism placed on top of the blue cubic block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** Similar to Structure 1, two orange cylinders form the base. A single yellow rectangular block is placed on top, spanning across both cylinders. A blue cube is placed on one end of the yellow block, and a red triangular prism sits on top of the blue cube.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**For Structure 1 (Left):**\n*   Layer 1: Orange Cylinder (horizontal) - Block Index **8** (Used twice)\n*   Layer 2: Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal, wider) - Block Index **5** (Used twice)\n*   Layer 3: Green Rectangular Block (vertical) - Block Index **3**\n*   Layer 4: Red Triangular Prism (orientation as in target) - Block Index **16**\n\n**For Structure 2 (Right):**\n*   Layer 1: Orange Cylinder (horizontal) - Block Index **8** (Used twice)\n*   Layer 2: Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal, narrower) - Block Index **6**\n*   Layer 3: Blue Cube - Block Index **1**\n*   Layer 4: Red Triangular Prism (orientation as in target) - Block Index **16**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** For both structures: 8, 8, 5, 5, 3, 16, 8, 8, 6, 1, 16\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {8}\n    Step2: Move block with index {8}\n    Step3: Move block with index {5}\n    Step4: Move block with index {5}\n    Step5: Move block with index {3}\n    Step6: Move block with index {16}\n    Step7: Move block with index {8}\n    Step8: Move block with index {8}\n    Step9: Move block with index {6}\n    Step10: Move block with index {1}\n    Step11: Move block with index {16}\n}"

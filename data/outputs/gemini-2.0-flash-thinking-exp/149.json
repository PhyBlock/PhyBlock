Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **8 blocks**.\n    - It has **4 layers**:\n        - Layer 1 (bottom): 2 blocks\n        - Layer 2: 2 blocks\n        - Layer 3: 1 block\n        - Layer 4 (top): 3 blocks\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1:** Two orange cylinders are placed side-by-side horizontally, forming the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed on top of the cylinders, oriented perpendicularly to each other and forming a cross shape. One yellow block is aligned along the length of the two cylinders, and the other is placed across them in the middle.\n    - **Layer 3:** A single orange cylinder is placed vertically on top of the intersection of the two yellow rectangular blocks, in the center of the cross.\n    - **Layer 4:** Three orange roof blocks are placed on the top. One roof block is placed centrally on top of the vertical orange cylinder. The other two roof blocks are placed on the exposed ends of the yellow rectangular blocks, on opposite sides of the central cylinder and roof.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the base layer (orange cylinders): We need two vertical orange cylinders, which correspond to **block index 6** from the dictionary. (Used twice)\n    - For the second layer (yellow rectangular blocks): We need two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks.  **Block index 1** and **block index 2** from the dictionary represent these. (Used once each)\n    - For the third layer (vertical orange cylinder): We need one vertical orange cylinder, which is again **block index 6**. (Used once)\n    - For the top layer (orange roof blocks):\n        - The central roof block appears to be a triangular prism oriented with its ridge pointing upwards and towards the front. This matches **block index 14**. (Used once)\n        - The two side roof blocks are triangular prisms placed on the ends of the yellow blocks, sloping outwards. These match **block index 16**. (Used twice)\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 6, 6, 1, 2, 6, 14, 16, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n* **Inference of Order:** Building from the ground up is the most logical assembly sequence.\n\n* **Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

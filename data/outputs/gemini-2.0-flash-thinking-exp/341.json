Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **10 blocks** and has **4 layers**.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side horizontally to form the base of the tower on the left side. A third red arch block is placed horizontally to the right, slightly separated from the tower base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two red cube blocks are placed on top of the two red arch blocks on the left side. A blue cube block is placed on top of the single red arch block on the right side.\n    *   **Layer 3:** Two yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal orientation) are placed on top of the two red cube blocks. A green rectangular block (vertical orientation) is placed on top of these two yellow blocks, centered.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top Layer):** A yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation) is placed on top of the green rectangular block. An orange triangular block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, centered.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch (horizontal orientation, used 3 times): Index **1** (used twice for the tower base) and **2** (used once for the right side structure).\n    *   Red Cube (used 2 times): Index **14**\n    *   Blue Cube (used 1 time): Index **7**\n    *   Yellow Rectangle (horizontal orientation, used 2 times for base, 1 time for top): Index **10** (used twice for base) and **12** (used once for top).\n    *   Green Rectangle (vertical orientation, used 1 time): Index **8**\n    *   Orange Triangle (used 1 time): Index **15**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {1}\n    Step2: Move block with index {1}\n    Step3: Move block with index {2}\n    Step4: Move block with index {14}\n    Step5: Move block with index {14}\n    Step6: Move block with index {7}\n    Step7: Move block with index {10}\n    Step8: Move block with index {10}\n    Step9: Move block with index {8}\n    Step10: Move block with index {12}\n    Step11: Move block with index {15}\n}"

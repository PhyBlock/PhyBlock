The smaller structure on the right is composed of 3 blocks and has 3 layers. We will focus on the main structure for the assembly instructions.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red arch blocks placed side-by-side, forming the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the left red arch block. A green cube block is placed on top of the right red arch block.\n    - **Layer 3:** A blue cube block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block. A red arch block is placed on top of the green cube block, oriented horizontally.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange triangular roof block is placed on top, spanning across the red arch block and partially over the blue cube block.\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- For Layer 1 (Red arches): We need two red arch blocks with the opening facing downwards. Block index **1** matches this description and orientation. We need two of block **1**.\n- For Layer 2 (Yellow rectangle): We need a horizontal yellow rectangular block. Block index **10** matches this description and orientation.\n- For Layer 2 (Green cube): We need a green cube block. Block index **7** matches this description and orientation.\n- For Layer 3 (Blue cube): We need a blue cube block. Block index **6** matches this description and orientation.\n- For Layer 3 (Red arch): We need a horizontal red arch block. Block index **2** matches this description and orientation.\n- For Layer 4 (Orange roof): We need an orange triangular roof block. Block index **14** matches this description and orientation.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 10, 7, 6, 2, 14\n\n## Determined Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **4 blocks** and has **2 layers**.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of two red arch-shaped blocks placed side-by-side, horizontally oriented, with their arched openings facing inwards towards each other.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Top Layer):** Consists of two orange triangular prism blocks placed on top of the red arch blocks. Each triangular block is positioned such that its longer rectangular face rests on the top surface of the arch blocks, forming a roof-like structure. The triangular blocks are placed adjacent to each other, meeting at the peak of the roof.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the bottom layer, we need two red arch blocks that match the shape and orientation in the target image. Block index **1** from the dictionary perfectly matches the red arch block in the target image. We need to use this block twice.\n    *   For the top layer, we need two orange triangular prism blocks. Block index **12** from the dictionary perfectly matches the orange triangular prism block in the target image. We need to use this block twice.\n*   **List Block Indices:** 1, 1, 12, 12\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {1}\n    Step2: Move block with index {1}\n    Step3: Move block with index {12}\n    Step4: Move block with index {12}\n}"

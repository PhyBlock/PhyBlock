Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 13 blocks and can be described as having approximately 3 layers in the left part and 2 layers in the right part, although layers are somewhat interleaved.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Right Structure:** Two orange cylindrical blocks are placed horizontally on the ground side-by-side. A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of these cylinders. Another yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the previous yellow block.\n    *   **Left Structure:** Two green rectangular blocks are placed vertically on the ground side-by-side. Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of the green blocks, side-by-side. Two orange cylindrical blocks are placed vertically on top of these yellow blocks. Two more yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top, spanning across the orange cylinders and green blocks below. Finally, an orange triangular block is placed on top of these last yellow rectangular blocks.\n    *   The right structure is positioned to the right of the left structure and slightly further back in the scene.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Orange Cylinder (Horizontal): Block index 10 (Used 2 times)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index 8 (Used 4 times)\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Vertical): Block index 1 (Used 2 times)\n    *   Orange Cylinder (Vertical): Block index 9 (Used 2 times)\n    *   Orange Triangular Block (Slant): Block index 13 (Used 1 time)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 10, 10, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 9, 9, 8, 8, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

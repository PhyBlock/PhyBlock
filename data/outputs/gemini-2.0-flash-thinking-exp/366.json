Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left - Triangular):**\n- **Count:** 4 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** 2 orange triangular prism blocks, placed side-by-side forming a base. The longer faces are on the ground.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** 1 blue cube block placed centrally on top of the orange triangular prisms.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** 1 green rectangular block placed on top of the blue cube, oriented horizontally.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right - Chair-like):**\n- **Count:** 9 blocks\n- **Layers:** 5 layers\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** 4 orange cylinder blocks, arranged in a rectangle to form legs.\n    - **Layer 2 (Seat):** 2 yellow rectangular blocks, placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the cylinder legs, forming the seat.\n    - **Layer 3 (Back - Lower):** 1 green cube block, placed at the back of the seat.\n    - **Layer 4 (Back - Middle):** 1 blue cube block, placed on top of the green cube.\n    - **Layer 5 (Back - Top):** 1 yellow semi-cylinder block, placed on top of the blue cube.\n\n**Spatial Relationships:**\n\n- **Triangular Structure:** The blue cube is supported by the two orange triangular prisms. The green rectangular block is supported by the blue cube.\n- **Chair-like Structure:** The yellow seat is supported by the four cylinder legs. The green, blue, and yellow semi-cylinder blocks are stacked vertically at the back of the seat, supported by each other and the seat.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Block Indices for Triangular Structure:**\n- Orange triangular prism (base): Index 14 (used twice)\n- Blue cube (middle): Index 1\n- Green rectangular block (top): Index 4\n\n**Block Indices for Chair-like Structure:**\n- Orange cylinder (legs): Index 8 (used four times)\n- Yellow rectangular block (seat): Index 7 (used twice)\n- Green cube (back - lower): Index 2\n- Blue cube (back - middle): Index 1\n- Yellow semi-cylinder (back - top): Index 10\n\n**List of Block Indices (in suggested assembly order):**\n8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 2, 1, 10, 14, 14, 1, 4\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n    Step11: Move block with index 14\n    Step12: Move block with index 1\n    Step13: Move block with index 4\n}"

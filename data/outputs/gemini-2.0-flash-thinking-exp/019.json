Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **7 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** 2 blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** 2 blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** 3 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Contains an orange cube on the left and a blue cube on the right. They are placed side-by-side on the ground level.\n    *   **Layer 2:**  Placed directly on top of Layer 1. It has a blue cube on the left, positioned above the orange cube of Layer 1, and an orange cube on the right, positioned above the blue cube of Layer 1.\n    *   **Layer 3:**  Forms the top of the structure. It consists of a horizontal green rectangular block placed centrally, spanning across both cubes of Layer 2. On top of this green block, there are two orange triangular prism blocks placed to form a roof shape. The left triangular block is oriented to slope downwards to the left, and the right triangular block is oriented to slope downwards to the right.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Orange Cube (Layer 1, left & Layer 2, right): **Index 3**\n    *   Blue Cube (Layer 1, right & Layer 2, left): **Index 1**\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Layer 3, middle): **Index 6**\n    *   Orange Triangular Prism (Layer 3, left roof): **Index 12**\n    *   Orange Triangular Prism (Layer 3, right roof): **Index 13**\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 3, 1, 1, 3, 6, 12, 13\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary perfectly match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks required in the main target image. No rotations are needed.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {3}\n    Step2: Move block with index {1}\n    Step3: Move block with index {1}\n    Step4: Move block with index {3}\n    Step5: Move block with index {6}\n    Step6: Move block with index {12}\n    Step7: Move block with index {13}\n}"

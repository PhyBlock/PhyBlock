Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **6 blocks** and has **5 layers**.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of two orange cylinder blocks placed horizontally and adjacent to each other.\n    - **Layer 2:** A green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two orange cylinders, spanning across both of them.\n    - **Layer 3:** A red cube block is placed centrally on top of the green rectangular block.\n    - **Layer 4:** A blue cube block is placed centrally on top of the red cube block.\n    - **Layer 5 (Top Layer):** An orange roof-shaped block is placed centrally on top of the blue cube block, forming the roof of the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the bottom layer (orange cylinders): We need two blocks corresponding to index **8**.\n    - For the second layer (green rectangular block): We need one block corresponding to index **4**.\n    - For the third layer (red cube): We need one block corresponding to index **3**.\n    - For the fourth layer (blue cube): We need one block corresponding to index **1**.\n    - For the top layer (orange roof block): We need one block corresponding to index **12**.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 8, 8, 4, 3, 1, 12\n\n- **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No rotation is needed, and blocks are used as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n- **Inference of Order:** The assembly order is inferred by starting from the base layer and building upwards.\n- **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n\n**Structure 1 (Tall Rectangular Structure):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 3 blocks and appears to be in 1 layer in terms of vertical stacking in the image, although it is built vertically.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** A horizontally oriented green rectangular block serves as the base. A vertically oriented yellow rectangular block is placed centrally on top of the green base. A vertically oriented green rectangular block is placed adjacent to the yellow block on its right side, both resting on the green base.\n\n**Structure 2 (Castle-like Structure):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 7 blocks and has 3 distinct layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red arch block forms the central base. An orange cylinder block is placed on each side of the arch, acting as supporting pillars.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** A green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the red arch and the two orange cylinder blocks, bridging across them. An orange rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the green rectangular block.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** A blue cube is positioned on top of the orange rectangular block. A red triangular roof block is placed on top of the blue cube.\n\n## 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**For Structure 1 (Tall Rectangular Structure):**\n- Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index 6\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (Vertical): Index 8\n- Green Rectangular Block (Vertical): Index 7\n\n**For Structure 2 (Castle-like Structure):**\n- Red Arch Block: Index 1\n- Orange Cylinder Block (x2): Index 10 (used twice)\n- Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index 6\n- Orange Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index 11\n- Blue Cube: Index 4\n- Red Triangle Roof: Index 13\n\n**List of Block Indices (combined for both structures in assembly order):** 6, 8, 7, 1, 10, 10, 6, 11, 4, 13\n\n## 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n }"

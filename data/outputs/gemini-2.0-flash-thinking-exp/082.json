Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **8 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 4 blocks (3 orange trapezoidal, 1 red U-shaped)\n    *   Layer 2 (Middle): 3 blocks (1 red solid curved, 2 yellow half-cylinder)\n    *   Layer 3 (Top): 1 block (1 orange trapezoidal)\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Three orange trapezoidal blocks are arranged in a triangular base shape. A red U-shaped block is placed in the center of this triangular base.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** A red solid block with curved top and bottom edges is positioned directly on top of the red U-shaped block from the layer below. Two yellow half-cylinder blocks are placed on either side of the red block, resting on the orange trapezoidal base.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange trapezoidal block is placed centrally on top of the red block in the middle layer.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Orange Trapezoidal Base (3 blocks): Index 12, 14, 16\n    *   Red U-shaped Base Center (1 block): Index 2\n    *   Red Solid Curved Middle (1 block): Index 1\n    *   Yellow Half-Cylinder Middle (2 blocks): Index 7, 7\n    *   Orange Trapezoidal Top (1 block): Index 12\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** The selected blocks are chosen to precisely match the shapes, colors, and orientations observed in the Main Target Image, using the Block Dictionary as the sole source and without any rotations.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** The assembly order is inferred to build the structure layer by layer, starting from the base and moving upwards.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 16\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **5 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** 2 red arched blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** 1 yellow rectangular block.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** 1 red circular block and 1 yellow rectangular block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** Two red arched blocks are placed side-by-side, forming the base of the structure. They are positioned with their arched openings facing outwards.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two red arched blocks, bridging across them.\n    *   **Top Layer:** A red circular block (with a hole) is placed vertically on the center of the yellow rectangular block. Another yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the red circular block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the bottom layer (red arched blocks), we need block index **1** twice.\n    *   For the middle layer (yellow rectangular block), we need block index **10**.\n    *   For the top layer (red circular block), we need block index **6**.\n    *   For the top layer (yellow rectangular block), we need block index **10** again.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 10, 6, 10\n\n*   **Matching Criteria Verification:**\n    *   Block 1 matches the red arched block in the bottom layer in shape, color, and orientation.\n    *   Block 10 matches the horizontal yellow rectangular block in both the middle and top layers in shape, color, and orientation.\n    *   Block 6 matches the red circular block in the top layer in shape, color, and orientation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the structure and the selected blocks, a possible assembly order is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 1\n  Step3: Move block with index 10\n  Step4: Move block with index 6\n  Step5: Move block with index 10\n}\n```"

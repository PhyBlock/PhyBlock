Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **6 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** 2 blocks (Red arch and Orange cylinder)\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** 2 blocks (Green rectangular and Red arch - part of it)\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** 2 blocks (Blue cube and Orange roof)\n    *   **Layer 4 (Topmost):** 1 block (Orange roof) - *Correction, there are only 3 layers if we consider the vertical stack. Let's re-examine layer by layer clearly.*\n\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Red arch block, Orange cylinder block. These are placed side-by-side.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Green rectangular block is placed on top of the red arch block.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Blue cube is placed on top of the green rectangular block. An Orange roof block is placed on top of the blue cube. Another Orange roof block is placed on top of the Orange cylinder block.\n\n    *   **Corrected Layers:**  3 Layers, 6 blocks.\n        *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Red arch block, Orange cylinder block (side by side)\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Green rectangular block (on top of the arch), Blue cube (partially on green and partially on cylinder), Red arch (partially under green) - *Correction again, Blue cube is on top of green, not partially on cylinder. Let's re-analyze spatial relationships carefully.*\n\n    *   **Final Layer Analysis:** 3 Layers, 6 blocks.\n        *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Red arch block and Orange cylinder block are placed adjacent to each other on the ground.\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the Red arch block.\n        *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Blue cube is placed on top of the Green rectangular block. An Orange roof block is placed on top of the Blue cube. Another Orange roof block is placed on top of the Orange cylinder block.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The **Red arch block** is on the ground level, supporting the **Green rectangular block**.\n    *   The **Orange cylinder block** is on the ground level, adjacent to the Red arch block.\n    *   The **Green rectangular block** is placed horizontally on top of the Red arch block.\n    *   The **Blue cube** is placed on top of the Green rectangular block.\n    *   One **Orange roof block** is placed on top of the Blue cube.\n    *   Another **Orange roof block** is placed on top of the Orange cylinder block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n    *   Red arch block (base): Index **1**\n    *   Orange cylinder block (base): Index **12**\n    *   Green rectangular block (middle layer): Index **11**\n    *   Blue cube (top layer): Index **6**\n    *   Orange roof block (on cube): Index **14**\n    *   Orange roof block (on cylinder): Index **16**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {1}\n    Step2: Move block with index {12}\n    Step3: Move block with index {11}\n    Step4: Move block with index {6}\n    Step5: Move block with index {14}\n    Step6: Move block with index {16}\n}"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **18 blocks** in total.\n    *   It has **4 main layers** in terms of the giraffe and dog structure, although some blocks within these structures create sub-layers.\n        *   **Layer 1 (Base):**  Consists of 4 orange cylinders (giraffe legs) and 1 green cube (dog base).\n        *   **Layer 2:**  Consists of 2 yellow long rectangles (giraffe body) and 4 blue cubes (dog corners) and 4 orange wedges (dog sides).\n        *   **Layer 3:** Consists of 1 yellow long rectangle (giraffe neck base).\n        *   **Layer 4 (Top):** Consists of 1 orange cylinder (giraffe neck) and 1 yellow semi-circle (giraffe head).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Giraffe:**\n        *   The giraffe is positioned on the right side of the image.\n        *   It stands on 4 orange cylinder legs, arranged in a rectangular pattern.\n        *   Two yellow long rectangles are placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the legs, forming the body.\n        *   A yellow long rectangle is placed vertically on top of the body in the center, acting as the base of the neck.\n        *   An orange cylinder is placed vertically on top of the neck base.\n        *   A yellow semi-circle is placed on top of the orange cylinder, forming the head.\n    *   **Dog-like Structure:**\n        *   The dog-like structure is positioned on the left side of the image.\n        *   It has a central green cube as its base.\n        *   Four blue cubes are positioned at each corner around the green cube, slightly offset outwards.\n        *   Four orange wedge blocks fill the gaps between the blue cubes, angled outwards.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Green Cube (Dog Center): Index **1** (Quantity: 1)\n    *   Blue Cube (Dog Corners): Index **4** (Quantity: 4)\n    *   Orange Wedge (Dog Sides): Index **16** (Quantity: 4)\n    *   Orange Cylinder (Giraffe Legs & Neck): Index **8** (Quantity: 5)\n    *   Yellow Long Rectangle (Giraffe Body & Neck Base): Index **6** (Quantity: 3)\n    *   Yellow Semi-circle (Giraffe Head): Index **10** (Quantity: 1)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step17\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step18\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```"

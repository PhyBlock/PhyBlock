Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe Main Target Image displays two distinct structures made of building blocks.\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Structure):**\n- **Block Count:** 5 blocks\n- **Layers:** 2 layers (considering the base layer and the top layer)\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of two orange wedge blocks placed side-by-side and one blue rectangular block placed on top of them.\n    - **Layer 2 (Top):** Consists of one orange cylinder placed vertically on the blue block and one orange wedge block placed on top of the cylinder, tilted to the right.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** Two orange wedge blocks form the base. A blue rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of these wedges. An orange cylinder is placed vertically on the blue block. Finally, an orange wedge block is placed on top of the cylinder, angled to the right.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Structure):**\n- **Block Count:** 6 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of two green square blocks placed adjacent to each other.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of two blue square blocks placed on top of the green blocks, aligned directly above them.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of one yellow square block placed on top of one blue block and one orange triangle block placed on top of the other blue block.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** Two green square blocks form the base. Two blue square blocks are placed on top of the green blocks. A yellow square block is placed on top of one blue square block, and an orange triangle block is placed on top of the other blue square block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Structure):**\n- Orange Wedge (bottom left): Block index **11**\n- Orange Wedge (bottom right): Block index **11**\n- Blue Rectangular (middle): Block index **5**\n- Orange Cylinder (top, vertical): Block index **7**\n- Orange Wedge (top, tilted right): Block index **12**\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Structure):**\n- Green Square (bottom layer): Block index **2**\n- Green Square (bottom layer): Block index **2**\n- Blue Square (middle layer): Block index **1**\n- Blue Square (middle layer): Block index **1**\n- Yellow Square (top layer): Block index **4**\n- Orange Triangle (top layer): Block index **16**\n\n**List of Block Indices (for both structures in assembly order):** 11, 11, 5, 7, 12, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 4\n    Step11: Move block with index 16\n}"

A blue cube is placed next to the red arch block, also on top of the yellow rectangular block and adjacent to the arch.\n- **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange cylinder block with a cone top is placed on top of the red arch block and one of the underlying orange cylinders.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Layers:** 3 layers.\n- **Block Count:** 5 blocks.\n- **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of two red arch blocks placed side-by-side on the ground.\n- **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two red arch blocks, spanning across both.\n- **Layer 3 (Top):** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side on top of the yellow rectangular block, directly above and aligned with the red arch blocks in Layer 1.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Orange Cylinder (Layer 1): Index 11 (x2)\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (Layer 2): Index 8 (x1)\n- Red Arch Block (Layer 3): Index 2 (x1)\n- Blue Cube (Layer 3): Index 5 (x1)\n- Orange Cylinder with Cone Top (Layer 4): Index 13 (x1)\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Red Arch Block (Layer 1 & Layer 3): Index 2 (x4)\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (Layer 2): Index 8 (x1)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 8, 8, 11, 11, 13\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

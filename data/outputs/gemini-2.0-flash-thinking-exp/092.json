Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 5 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 green rectangular blocks placed vertically and side-by-side.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 1 yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the two green blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 1 orange cylindrical block placed vertically on the yellow block, and 1 yellow semi-circular block (half-cylinder) placed on top of the orange cylinder.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two green rectangular blocks form the base, standing vertically and adjacent to each other.\n    *   A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across and on top of both green blocks, acting as a bridge.\n    *   An orange cylindrical block is positioned vertically on the yellow block, roughly in the center.\n    *   A yellow semi-circular block is placed on top of the orange cylinder, with its flat side down and curved side facing upwards.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the two bottom green vertical rectangular blocks: **Index 2** (used twice)\n    *   For the middle yellow horizontal rectangular block: **Index 6**\n    *   For the orange vertical cylindrical block: **Index 10**\n    *   For the top yellow semi-circular block: **Index 12**\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary perfectly match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No rotation is needed or applied.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** The assembly order is inferred to be bottom-up, layer by layer.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of two separate sub-structures.\n    *   **Left Sub-structure:** 3 blocks, 2 layers. Layer 1 has 2 red semi-circular blocks, and Layer 2 has 1 blue cube.\n    *   **Right Sub-structure:** 4 blocks, 2 layers. Layer 1 has 2 yellow semi-circular blocks, and Layer 2 has 2 cubes (1 green and 1 blue).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Sub-structure:**\n        *   Two red semi-circular blocks are placed side-by-side on the base layer, forming a slightly elongated base.\n        *   A blue cube is positioned on top of these two semi-circular blocks, centered above the seam where the two semi-circular blocks meet.\n    *   **Right Sub-structure:**\n        *   Two yellow semi-circular blocks are placed side-by-side on the base layer, forming a slightly elongated base.\n        *   A green cube is placed on top of one yellow semi-circular block.\n        *   A blue cube is placed on top of the other yellow semi-circular block, adjacent to the green cube.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red semi-circular block (for the left structure, bottom layer): Index **2** (Used twice)\n    *   Blue cube (for the left structure, top layer): Index **6** (Used twice)\n    *   Yellow semi-circular block (for the right structure, bottom layer): Index **11** (Used twice)\n    *   Green cube (for the right structure, top layer): Index **7** (Used once)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 6, 11, 11, 7, 6\n\n*   **Matching Criteria Verification:**\n    *   Block 2 from the dictionary matches the red semi-circular blocks in the main image in shape, color, and orientation.\n    *   Block 6 from the dictionary matches the blue cubes in the main image in shape, color, and orientation.\n    *   Block 11 from the dictionary matches the yellow semi-circular blocks in the main image in shape, color, and orientation.\n    *   Block 7 from the dictionary matches the green cube in the main image in shape, color, and orientation.\n    *   All selected blocks are used exactly as they appear in the dictionary without any rotation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {2}\n    Step2: Move block with index {2}\n    Step3: Move block with index {6}\n    Step4: Move block with index {11}\n    Step5: Move block with index {11}\n    Step6: Move block with index {7}\n    Step7: Move block with index {6}\n}"

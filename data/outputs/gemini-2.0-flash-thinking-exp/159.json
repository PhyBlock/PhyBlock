They seem to form a square around the central cube.\n    * Surrounding the blue wedges are four orange wedge-shaped blocks. These are placed such that their pointed ends are facing outwards, away from the green cube. They are positioned at the corners formed by the blue wedges, completing a larger square-like structure.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**For Structure 1 (Left):**\n* **Orange Cylinder (Horizontal):** Block index **10** (Used twice)\n* **Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal):** Block index **8**\n* **Red Cube:** Block index **3**\n* **Blue Cube:** Block index **1**\n\n**For Structure 2 (Right):**\n* **Green Cube:** Block index **2**\n* **Blue Wedge (Angled Inwards):** Block index **15** (Used four times)\n* **Orange Wedge (Angled Outwards):** Block index **16** (Used four times)\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\n* Structure 1: 10, 10, 8, 3, 1\n* Structure 2: 2, 15, 15, 15, 15, 16, 16, 16, 16\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 1 (Left):**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 2 (Right):**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

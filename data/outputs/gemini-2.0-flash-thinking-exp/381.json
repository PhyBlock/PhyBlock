Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 15 blocks and has approximately 4 layers at its highest point.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Left Structure:**\n        - The base layer consists of a red arch, an orange cylinder, and an orange wedge, arranged from left to right.\n        - On top of the red arch is a vertical green rectangular prism.\n        - On top of the orange cylinder is another orange cylinder.\n        - On top of the orange wedge is a red wedge.\n        - The topmost layer is an orange triangle placed on top of the vertical green rectangular prism.\n    - **Right Structure:**\n        - The base layer consists of two red arches placed side-by-side.\n        - On top of each red arch is a horizontal yellow rectangular prism.\n        - On top of each yellow rectangular prism is a horizontal green rectangular prism.\n        - The topmost layer has a horizontal yellow rectangular prism on top of the left green prism and an orange triangle on top of the right green prism.\n    - The left and right structures are positioned adjacent to each other, with a small gap in between.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Red Arch (for base of left structure and right structure): Block 1 (x3)\n    - Orange Cylinder (for base and middle of left structure): Block 10 (x2)\n    - Orange Wedge (for base of left structure): Block 12 (x1)\n    - Green Rectangular Prism (vertical, for middle of left structure): Block 5 (x1)\n    - Red Wedge (for middle of left structure): Block 16 (x1)\n    - Orange Triangle (for top of left and right structure): Block 13 (x2)\n    - Yellow Rectangular Prism (horizontal, for middle of right structure): Block 7 (x2)\n    - Green Rectangular Prism (horizontal, for top of right structure): Block 6 (x2)\n    - Yellow Rectangular Prism (horizontal, thin, for topmost of right structure): Block 8 (x1)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 1, 10, 10, 12, 5, 16, 13, 7, 7, 6, 6, 8, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

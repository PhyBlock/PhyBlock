Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **4 blocks** and has **2 layers**.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** Consists of a red, curved block placed horizontally on the base.\n    *   **Middle Layer:**  Two blue cube blocks are positioned horizontally, inserted into the curved opening of the red block from the bottom layer. They are placed side-by-side within the curve.\n    *   **Top Layer:** Another red, curved block is placed on top of the blue cubes and the bottom red block. It is oriented in the opposite direction (vertically flipped) compared to the bottom red block, such that its curved opening faces downwards and encloses the blue blocks from above.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   For the bottom red curved block: Block with index **6**\n    *   For the top red curved block: Block with index **5**\n    *   For the two blue cube blocks: Block with index **9** (used twice)\n*   **List Block Indices:** 6, 9, 9, 5\n*   **Matching Criteria:**\n    *   Block 6 matches the shape and orientation of the bottom red curved block in the target image.\n    *   Block 5 matches the shape and (flipped) orientation of the top red curved block in the target image.\n    *   Block 9 matches the shape, color, and orientation of the blue cube blocks in the target image.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the structure and selected blocks, a possible assembly order is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n}\n```"

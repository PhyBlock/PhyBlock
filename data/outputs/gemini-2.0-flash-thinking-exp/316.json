            "text": "## Task Completion:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Left Structure:**\n- **Block Count:** 6 blocks\n- **Layers:** 2 layers\n- **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 4 orange triangle blocks arranged to form a square base. The pointed ends of the triangles face outwards, and the flat sides form the inner square.\n- **Layer 2 (Top):**  Has 2 blocks. A blue square block is placed centrally on the square base formed by the orange triangles. A green square block is placed directly on top of the blue square block.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The orange triangles are adjacent to each other forming a closed square. The blue block is centered on this square. The green block is stacked directly above the blue block.\n\n**Right Structure:**\n- **Block Count:** 8 blocks\n- **Layers:** 4 layers (considering each distinct level of blocks as a layer)\n- **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 yellow square blocks placed side-by-side horizontally.\n- **Layer 2:** Consists of 2 orange rectangular blocks placed on top of the yellow blocks. They are oriented lengthwise and positioned side-by-side above the yellow blocks.\n- **Layer 3:**  Consists of 1 red arch block placed on top of the orange rectangular blocks. The arch spans across both orange blocks.\n- **Layer 4 (Top):** Consists of 3 blocks. A blue square block is placed on the left side of the arch. A green square block is placed next to the blue block on the right side of the arch. An orange triangle block is placed on top of the green square block, positioned towards the right side of the structure.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** Yellow blocks are adjacent horizontally. Orange rectangular blocks are placed on top of and aligned with the yellow blocks. The red arch sits centrally on the orange blocks. The blue and green squares are placed side-by-side on the arch. The orange triangle sits atop the green square.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Left Structure:**\n- Orange Triangle Blocks (for base): Block index 16 (used 4 times)\n- Blue Square Block (bottom of top layer): Block index 4 (used 1 time)\n- Green Square Block (top of top layer): Block index 5 (used 1 time)\n\n**Right Structure:**\n- Yellow Square Blocks (base): Block index 6 (used 2 times)\n- Orange Rectangular Blocks (middle layer): Block index 11 (used 2 times)\n- Red Arch Block (middle layer): Block index 1 (used 1 time)\n- Blue Square Block (top layer): Block index 7 (used 1 time)\n- Green Square Block (top layer): Block index 5 (used 1 time)\n- Orange Triangle Block (top layer): Block index 12 (used 1 time)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 16, 16, 16, 16, 4, 5, 6, 6, 11, 11, 1, 7, 5, 12\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```"

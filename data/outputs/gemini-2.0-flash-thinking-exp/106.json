Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **4 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 orange cylindrical blocks laid horizontally side-by-side.\n    * **Layer 2 (Middle):** A single yellow curved block is placed on top of the two orange cylinders, oriented horizontally.\n    * **Layer 3 (Top):** A single blue cubic block is placed on top of the yellow curved block.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The two orange cylindrical blocks are adjacent to each other on the base layer.\n    * The yellow curved block is positioned centrally on top of the two orange cylinders, spanning across both.\n    * The blue cubic block is positioned centrally on top of the yellow curved block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    * **Bottom Layer (Orange Cylinders):**  We need two orange cylinders in a horizontal orientation. From the dictionary, **Block index 9** and **Block index 10** are suitable.\n    * **Middle Layer (Yellow Curved Block):** We need a yellow curved block in a horizontal orientation. From the dictionary, **Block index 12** matches this requirement.\n    * **Top Layer (Blue Cubic Block):** We need a blue cube. From the dictionary, **Block index 1** is a blue cube.\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 9, 10, 12\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks (indices 1, 9, 10, 12) perfectly match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks required in the Main Target Image, as presented in the Block Dictionary Image. No rotation is needed or allowed.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n* **Inference of Order:** To build the structure, we should start from the bottom layer and move upwards.\n\n* **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 9\n  Step2: Move block with index 10\n  Step3: Move block with index 12\n  Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n```"

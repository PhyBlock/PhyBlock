Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Structure 1 (Truck):**\n    - Count & Layers: 6 blocks, 3 layers (considering cylinder base as layer 1).\n    - Spatial Relationships:\n        - Layer 1 (Bottom): Four orange cylinders are placed horizontally, forming two pairs of wheels.\n        - Layer 2 (Middle): A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the cylinders, acting as the truck's base.\n        - Layer 3 (Top): A blue cubic block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, towards one end, forming the truck's cabin.\n\n* **Structure 2 (House):**\n    - Count & Layers: 10 blocks, 3 layers.\n    - Spatial Relationships:\n        - Layer 1 (Bottom): Four square blocks forming a 2x2 base. Two green square blocks are placed side-by-side, adjacent to two red square blocks placed side-by-side.\n        - Layer 2 (Middle): Four square blocks placed on top of the base layer. Two red square blocks are placed on top of the green blocks of the base layer. A yellow square block is placed on top of one of the red blocks from the base layer and a blue square block is placed on top of the other red block from the base layer.\n        - Layer 3 (Top): Two orange triangular prism blocks are placed on top of the second layer to form a roof shape.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Truck:**\n    - Orange Cylinder (wheels): Block index 11 (Used 4 times)\n    - Yellow Rectangular Block (base): Block index 8 (Used 1 time)\n    - Blue Cubic Block (cabin): Block index 1 (Used 1 time)\n\n* **House:**\n    - Green Square Block (base): Block index 2 (Used 2 times)\n    - Red Square Block (base & middle): Block index 3 (Used 4 times)\n    - Yellow Square Block (middle): Block index 4 (Used 1 time)\n    - Blue Square Block (middle): Block index 1 (Used 1 time)\n    - Orange Triangular Prism Block (roof - left side): Block index 14 (Used 1 time)\n    - Orange Triangular Prism Block (roof - right side): Block index 15 (Used 1 time)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 11, 11, 11, 11, 8, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 1, 14, 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 3\n    Step10: Move block with index 3\n    Step11: Move block with index 3\n    Step12: Move block with index 3\n    Step13: Move block with index 4\n    Step14: Move block with index 1\n    Step15: Move block with index 14\n    Step16: Move block with index 15\n }"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of **9 blocks** and has **4 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1:** 2 blue rectangular blocks (base).\n    *   **Layer 2:** 2 yellow rectangular blocks, placed on top of the blue blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3:** 2 red cubic blocks, placed on top of the yellow blocks.\n    *   **Layer 4:** 1 green rectangular block and 2 orange triangular blocks forming a roof.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two blue rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side on the ground level.\n    *   Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed on top of the blue blocks, also side-by-side. They appear slightly wider than the blue blocks.\n    *   Two red cubic blocks are placed on top of the yellow blocks, side-by-side, and seem slightly narrower than the yellow blocks.\n    *   A green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the left red cube.\n    *   Two orange triangular blocks are positioned on top of the green rectangular block and the right red cube, forming a slanted roof shape.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of **7 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1:** 2 yellow rectangular blocks (vertical orientation) forming the base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** 2 green rectangular blocks (horizontal orientation) placed on top of the yellow blocks, and 1 red cubic block placed in the opening between the green blocks and resting on the yellow blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3:** 2 yellow rectangular blocks (vertical orientation) placed on top of the green blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two yellow rectangular blocks are standing vertically side-by-side on the ground.\n    *   Two green rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of the yellow blocks, creating a horizontal beam.\n    *   A red cubic block is placed in the opening formed by the lower yellow blocks and the upper green blocks, seemingly supported by the lower yellow blocks.\n    *   Two more yellow rectangular blocks are placed vertically on top of the green rectangular blocks, completing the frame-like structure.\n\n### 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**For Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   Blue base blocks (Layer 1): Block index **1** (Blue Cube) - need 2.\n*   Yellow layer blocks (Layer 2): Block index **8** (Yellow Rectangle Horizontal) - need 2.\n*   Red layer blocks (Layer 3): Block index **2** (Red Cube) - need 2.\n*   Green top block (Layer 4): Block index **5** (Green Rectangle Horizontal) - need 1.\n*   Orange roof blocks (Layer 4): Block index **13** (Orange Triangle) - need 2.\n\n**For Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   Yellow vertical base blocks (Layer 1): Block index **9** (Yellow Rectangle Vertical) - need 2.\n*   Green horizontal blocks (Layer 2): Block index **5** (Green Rectangle Horizontal) - need 2.\n*   Red middle block (Layer 2): Block index **2** (Red Cube) - need 1.\n*   Yellow vertical top blocks (Layer 3): Block index **9** (Yellow Rectangle Vertical) - need 2.\n\n### 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9\"\n}\n```"

The right wall-like structure is 3 layers high.\n    -   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        -   **Left Tower:**\n            -   Layer 1: Two orange cylinders are placed side-by-side as the base.\n            -   Layer 2: A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two cylinders.\n            -   Layer 3: Another yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the previous yellow block, slightly shifted to the right.\n            -   Layer 4: A red arch block is placed on top of the second yellow block, centered.\n            -   Layer 5: An orange triangular prism is placed vertically on top of the red arch block.\n        -   **Right Wall-like Structure:**\n            -   Layer 1: Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed vertically, parallel to each other, forming the base.\n            -   Layer 2: A red rectangular block and a blue cube are placed horizontally side-by-side between the two vertical yellow blocks. The red block is to the left and the blue cube to the right.\n            -   Layer 3: Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top, spanning across the vertical yellow blocks and the red and blue blocks below, acting as a cap.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n    -   **Needed Blocks and Block Indices:**\n        -   Orange Cylinder (vertical): Index 13 (needed 2 times)\n        -   Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal): Index 9 (needed 4 times)\n        -   Yellow Rectangular Block (vertical): Index 11 (needed 2 times)\n        -   Red Arch Block: Index 1 (needed 1 time)\n        -   Orange Triangular Prism (vertical): Index 14 (needed 1 time)\n        -   Red Rectangular Block (horizontal): Index 5 (needed 1 time)\n        -   Blue Cube: Index 4 (needed 1 time)\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 11\n  Step2: Move block with index 11\n  Step3: Move block with index 5\n  Step4: Move block with index 4\n  Step5: Move block with index 9\n  Step6: Move block with index 9\n  Step7: Move block with index 13\n  Step8: Move block with index 13\n  Step9: Move block with index 9\n  Step10: Move block with index 9\n  Step11: Move block with index 1\n  Step12: Move block with index 14\n}\n```"

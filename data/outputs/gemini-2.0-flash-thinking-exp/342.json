Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **11 blocks** in total.\n    *   It has **2 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of 4 orange cylindrical blocks and 2 yellow rectangular blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Top Layer):** Consists of 4 green rectangular blocks and 1 green rectangular block.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   On the **left side**, four orange cylindrical blocks are arranged in a row on the ground level. Four green rectangular blocks are placed on top of these cylinders, forming a rectangular platform. These green blocks are arranged in a 2x2 grid pattern.\n    *   On the **right side**, two yellow rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side on the ground level. A single green rectangular block is placed vertically on top of the two yellow blocks, positioned centrally above them.\n    *   The right structure is positioned slightly to the right and forward relative to the left structure in the view.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Orange Cylinder (Vertical): Block index **13** (Needed 4 times)\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index **2** (Needed 4 times)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index **7** (Needed 2 times)\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Vertical): Block index **3** (Needed 1 time)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 13, 13, 13, 13, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks precisely match the shape, color, and rotational orientation of the blocks in the target image as provided in the dictionary. No rotations are applied.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 3\"\n}\n```"

An orange triangular prism is placed in front of and slightly to the left of the green rectangular block. A blue cube is placed to the right of the green rectangular block. A yellow cube is placed to the right of the blue cube. An orange cylinder is placed behind the blue and yellow cubes.\n        - **Layer 2 (Middle):** A yellow cube is placed directly on top of the yellow cube from the bottom layer. A red curved block (horizontal orientation) is placed on top of the orange cylinder from the bottom layer.\n        - **Layer 3 (Top):** Two yellow curved blocks are placed side-by-side on top of the red curved block, forming the \"ears\" or top part of the structure.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n    - **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n        - Green rectangular block (horizontal): **Index 6**\n        - Orange triangular prism: **Index 15**\n        - Blue cube: **Index 3**\n        - Yellow cube: **Index 4** (used twice)\n        - Orange cylinder: **Index 7**\n        - Red curved block (horizontal): **Index 1**\n        - Yellow curved block: **Index 8** (used twice)\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n    - **Assembly Sequence:**\n        {\n           Step1: Move block with index {6}\n           Step2: Move block with index {15}\n           Step3: Move block with index {3}\n           Step4: Move block with index {4}\n           Step5: Move block with index {7}\n           Step6: Move block with index {4}\n           Step7: Move block with index {1}\n           Step8: Move block with index {8}\n           Step9: Move block with index {8}\n        }"

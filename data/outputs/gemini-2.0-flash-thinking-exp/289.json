Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of two separate sub-structures.\n    - **Left Sub-structure:** Contains 5 blocks and appears to have 5 layers.\n    - **Right Sub-structure:** Contains 7 blocks and appears to have 3 layers.\n    - **Total Blocks:** 12 blocks in total for the entire structure.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Left Sub-structure:**\n        - Layer 1 (Bottom): Two orange cylinder blocks placed side-by-side on the ground.\n        - Layer 2: One yellow curved block (arch shape) placed horizontally on top of the two cylinders, spanning across them.\n        - Layer 3: One red curved block (arch shape) placed horizontally on top of the yellow curved block, aligned in the same direction.\n        - Layer 4: One orange cylinder block placed vertically on top of the red curved block, centered.\n        - Layer 5 (Top): One orange cylinder block placed vertically on top of the previous orange cylinder block, continuing the vertical stack.\n    - **Right Sub-structure:**\n        - Layer 1 (Bottom): Two yellow rectangular blocks placed side-by-side horizontally, forming a base.\n        - Layer 2: Four cube blocks placed on top of the yellow rectangular blocks in a 2x2 grid. From front to back and left to right: green, orange, blue, red.\n        - Layer 3 (Top): One yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the 2x2 grid of cube blocks, spanning across them.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Orange Cylinder (Tall - for left structure base and top): Index 9 (needed 3 times)\n    - Yellow Curved Block (Arch - for left structure middle): Index 10 (needed 1 time)\n    - Red Curved Block (Arch - for left structure middle): Index 1 (needed 1 time)\n    - Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal - for right structure base and top): Index 8 (needed 3 times)\n    - Green Cube (for right structure middle): Index 4 (needed 1 time)\n    - Orange Cube (for right structure middle): Index 5 (needed 1 time)\n    - Blue Cube (for right structure middle): Index 3 (needed 1 time)\n    - Red Cube (for right structure middle): Index 6 (needed 1 time)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 9, 9, 9, 10, 1, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 3, 6\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {9}\n    Step2: Move block with index {9}\n    Step3: Move block with index {10}\n    Step4: Move block with index {1}\n    Step5: Move block with index {9}\n    Step6: Move block with index {9}\n    Step7: Move block with index {8}\n    Step8: Move block with index {8}\n    Step9: Move block with index {4}\n    Step10: Move block with index {5}\n    Step11: Move block with index {3}\n    Step12: Move block with index {6}\n    Step13: Move block with index {8}\n }"

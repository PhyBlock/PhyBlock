Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **9 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of 4 orange cylindrical blocks forming the base.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle Layer):** Consists of 1 horizontal yellow rectangular prism placed on top of the cylindrical base.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top Layer):** Consists of 1 blue cube, 2 orange triangular prisms leaning inwards towards the center, and 1 yellow semi-cylinder placed on top of the blue cube.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The four orange cylinders are arranged in a square pattern to support the structure above.\n    *   The yellow rectangular prism is placed horizontally and centrally on top of the four cylinders.\n    *   The blue cube is positioned centrally on top of the yellow rectangular prism.\n    *   Two orange triangular prisms are placed on the yellow rectangular prism, flanking the blue cube, and leaning towards each other at the top.\n    *   The yellow semi-cylinder is placed on top of the blue cube, nestled between the leaning orange triangular prisms.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the 4 orange cylindrical base blocks: Use **Block Index 8** (4 times).\n    *   For the horizontal yellow rectangular prism: Use **Block Index 4** (1 time).\n    *   For the blue cube: Use **Block Index 1** (1 time).\n    *   For the two orange triangular prisms: Use **Block Index 14** and **Block Index 15** (1 time each).\n    *   For the yellow semi-cylinder: Use **Block Index 10** (1 time).\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 1, 14, 15, 10\n\n*   **Matching Criteria Justification:**\n    *   **Block Index 8:** Matches the orange cylinder shape and vertical orientation required for the base.\n    *   **Block Index 4:** Matches the horizontal yellow rectangular prism shape and orientation needed for the middle layer.\n    *   **Block Index 1:** Matches the blue cube shape and orientation required for the top layer.\n    *   **Block Index 14 & 15:** Match the orange triangular prism shapes and orientations needed for the slanted blocks on the top layer.\n    *   **Block Index 10:** Matches the yellow semi-cylinder shape and orientation required for the top-most block.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```"

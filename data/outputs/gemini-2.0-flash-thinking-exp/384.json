Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **18 blocks**.\n    *   It has **3 layers**.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of two separate sets of red arch blocks. The left set has 4 arch blocks placed side-by-side, and the right set has 3 arch blocks placed side-by-side, with a small gap between the two sets.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle Layer):**\n        *   **Left Section (above the 4 arch blocks):** Starting from left to right, there is a yellow half-cylinder block placed on the first arch, followed by a blue cube on the next arch, then a green rectangular prism standing vertically on the next arch, and an orange cube on the last arch. A yellow rectangular prism (horizontal orientation) is placed on top of these four blocks, spanning across the arch blocks.\n        *   **Right Section (above the 3 arch blocks):** A yellow rectangular prism (horizontal orientation) is placed on top of the arch blocks. A red arch block is placed on top of this yellow rectangular prism.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top Layer):**\n        *   **Left Section (above the left yellow rectangular prism):** Two yellow rectangular prisms (vertical orientation) are stacked on top of each other.\n        *   **Right Section (above the right red arch block and yellow rectangular prism):** Two orange triangle prism blocks are placed to form a roof shape, resting on the red arch block and the yellow rectangular prism below.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch Block (x7): Index 1\n    *   Yellow Half-Cylinder (x1): Index 14\n    *   Blue Cube (x1): Index 6\n    *   Green Rectangular Prism (x1): Index 8\n    *   Orange Cube (x1): Index 7\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism Horizontal (x2): Index 10\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism Vertical (x2): Index 11\n    *   Orange Triangle Prism (x2): Index 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step17\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step18\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```"

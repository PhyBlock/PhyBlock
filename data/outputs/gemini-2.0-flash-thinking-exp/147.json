A red arch block is placed on the right orange cylinder and partially on the yellow rectangular block. A yellow half-cylinder is placed next to the red arch, also on the yellow rectangular block and the right orange cylinder.\n      - **Layer 3:** A red rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the yellow half-cylinder and the red arch. An orange cylinder is placed vertically on top of the left orange cylinder from the bottom layer.\n      - **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange pyramid is placed on top of the right orange cylinder from the bottom layer. Another orange pyramid is placed on top of the vertical orange cylinder from layer 3.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n   - **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n      - For the base layer (2 orange cylinders): Block index 9 (used twice)\n      - For the second layer (yellow rectangle, red arch, yellow half-cylinder): Block index 4, Block index 1, Block index 10\n      - For the third layer (red rectangle, orange cylinder): Block index 12, Block index 8\n      - For the top layer (2 orange pyramids): Block index 14 (used twice)\n   - **List Block Indices:** 9, 9, 4, 1, 10, 12, 8, 14, 14\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

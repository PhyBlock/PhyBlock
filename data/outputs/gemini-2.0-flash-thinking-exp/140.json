Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **5 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 1 red arch block.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 rectangular blocks, one green and one yellow, placed side-by-side.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 2 triangular blocks, one yellow and one orange, placed side-by-side.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The **red arch block** forms the base of the structure. It is oriented with the arch facing towards the viewer.\n    *   The **green rectangular block** is placed directly on top of the red arch, centered and oriented horizontally.\n    *   The **yellow rectangular block** is placed adjacent to the green rectangular block on the same layer, also on top of the red arch and oriented horizontally, to the right of the green block.\n    *   The **yellow triangular block** is placed on top of the green rectangular block, oriented with its slanted side facing to the right.\n    *   The **orange triangular block** is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, oriented with its slanted side facing to the left, adjacent to the yellow triangular block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch Block (Bottom Layer): **Index 1**\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Middle Layer, Left): **Index 5**\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Block (Middle Layer, Right): **Index 8**\n    *   Yellow Triangular Block (Top Layer, Left): **Index 14**\n    *   Orange Triangular Block (Top Layer, Right): **Index 16**\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 5, 8, 14, 16\n\n*   **Matching Criteria Verification:**\n    *   **Block 1:** Matches the red arch block in shape, color, and orientation required for the base.\n    *   **Block 5:** Matches the green horizontal rectangular block required for the middle layer.\n    *   **Block 8:** Matches the yellow horizontal rectangular block required for the middle layer.\n    *   **Block 14:** Matches the yellow triangular block with the correct slant for the top left position.\n    *   **Block 16:** Matches the orange triangular block with the correct slant for the top right position.\n    *   All selected blocks are used exactly as they appear in the dictionary without any rotation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

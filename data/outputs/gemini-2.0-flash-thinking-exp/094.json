Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **9 blocks** in total.\n    *   It has **3 distinct layers**:\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 4 orange cylindrical blocks forming the base/legs.\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 yellow rectangular blocks placed side-by-side on top of the cylindrical blocks, creating a platform.\n        *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 3 blocks: an orange cylindrical block standing vertically, a yellow semi-cylindrical block placed horizontally on top of the vertical cylinder, and an orange triangular block placed at the rear of the yellow rectangular blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** The four orange cylindrical blocks are positioned in a rectangular arrangement to support the structure above.\n    *   **Layer 2:** The two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally and adjacent to each other, directly on top of the orange cylinders, forming a flat surface.\n    *   **Layer 3:**\n        *   The orange cylindrical block is placed vertically on the yellow platform, towards the back of the structure.\n        *   The yellow semi-cylindrical block is placed horizontally on top of the vertical orange cylinder, forming the head-like shape.\n        *   The orange triangular block is placed at the back edge of the yellow platform, appearing as a tail.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the **4 orange cylinders** in Layer 1 and Layer 3 (neck):  We need block index **5** (vertical orange cylinder).\n    *   For the **2 yellow rectangular blocks** in Layer 2: We need block index **1** (horizontal yellow rectangular block).\n    *   For the **yellow semi-cylinder** in Layer 3 (head): We need block index **8** (horizontal yellow semi-cylinder).\n    *   For the **orange triangle** in Layer 3 (tail): We need block index **14** (orange triangle in the correct orientation).\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 5, 8, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inferred Assembly Sequence:** We will build the structure layer by layer, starting from the bottom.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **11 blocks** in total.\n    *   The structure can be divided into **4 conceptual layers** if we consider the top of the chair backrest as a separate layer, or 3 main layers.\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of orange cylinders (chair legs) and yellow half-cylinders (ground structure base).\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of yellow rectangles (chair seat) and blue & green cubes (ground structure top).\n        *   **Layer 3 (Top of Chair):** Consists of the green rectangle (chair backrest).\n        *   **Layer 4 (Topmost of Chair):** Consists of the yellow half-cylinder (chair backrest top).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Chair Structure:**\n        *   Three orange cylinder blocks are placed vertically in a row to form the legs of the chair.\n        *   Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the orange cylinders, forming the chair seat.\n        *   A green rectangular block is placed vertically on the back edge of the yellow seat blocks, forming the chair backrest.\n        *   A yellow half-cylinder block is placed on top of the green rectangular backrest block.\n    *   **Ground Structure:**\n        *   Two yellow half-cylinder blocks are placed side-by-side on the ground.\n        *   A blue cube and a green cube are placed side-by-side on top of the yellow half-cylinder blocks.\n    *   The ground structure is placed to the right and slightly in front of the chair structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Orange Cylinder (Vertical): Block Index **13** (Needed 3 times)\n    *   Yellow Rectangle (Horizontal): Block Index **12** (Needed 2 times)\n    *   Green Rectangle (Vertical): Block Index **7** (Needed 1 time)\n    *   Yellow Half-Cylinder: Block Index **15** (Needed 3 times)\n    *   Blue Cube: Block Index **1** (Needed 1 time)\n    *   Green Cube: Block Index **2** (Needed 1 time)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {15}\n    Step2: Move block with index {15}\n    Step3: Move block with index {1}\n    Step4: Move block with index {2}\n    Step5: Move block with index {13}\n    Step6: Move block with index {13}\n    Step7: Move block with index {13}\n    Step8: Move block with index {12}\n    Step9: Move block with index {12}\n    Step10: Move block with index {7}\n    Step11: Move block with index {15}\n}"

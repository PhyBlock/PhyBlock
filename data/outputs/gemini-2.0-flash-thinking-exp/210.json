Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- **Block Count:** 4 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** One red arch block is placed directly on the ground.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** A yellow half-cylinder block is placed on top of the left side of the red arch block. A blue cube block is placed adjacent to the right side of the yellow half-cylinder block, also on top of the red arch block.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange triangular prism block is placed on top of the blue cube block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Block Count:** 5 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side, adjacent to each other on the ground.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across and on top of both red arch blocks from the layer below.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side, on top of the yellow rectangular block, directly above and aligned with the red arch blocks in the bottom layer.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Red Arch Block (Bottom): Block index 1\n- Yellow Half-Cylinder Block (Middle): Block index 10\n- Blue Cube Block (Middle): Block index 6\n- Orange Triangular Prism Block (Top): Block index 15\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Red Arch Block (Bottom - Left): Block index 1\n- Red Arch Block (Bottom - Right): Block index 1\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (Middle): Block index 9\n- Red Arch Block (Top - Left): Block index 1\n- Red Arch Block (Top - Right): Block index 1\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 10, 6, 15, 1, 1, 9, 1, 1\n\n**3.

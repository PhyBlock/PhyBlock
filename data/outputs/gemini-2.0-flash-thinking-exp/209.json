Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **8 blocks** and has **4 layers**.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Contains 2 blocks.\n    - **Layer 2:** Contains 2 blocks, placed on top of Layer 1.\n    - **Layer 3:** Contains 2 blocks, placed on top of Layer 2.\n    - **Layer 4 (Roof):** Contains 2 blocks, placed on top of Layer 3.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1:** A green cube is placed to the left, and an orange cube is placed to its right, adjacent to each other.\n    - **Layer 2:** An orange cube is placed directly on top of the green cube from Layer 1. A blue cube is placed directly on top of the orange cube from Layer 1, adjacent to the orange cube of Layer 2.\n    - **Layer 3:** A yellow cube is placed directly on top of the orange cube from Layer 2. An orange triangle prism is placed directly on top of the blue cube from Layer 2, adjacent to the yellow cube of Layer 3.\n    - **Layer 4 (Roof):** Two orange triangle prisms are placed on top of the blocks in Layer 3. One orange triangle prism is placed on top of the yellow cube, and the other orange triangle prism is placed on top of the orange triangle prism from Layer 3, forming a roof shape.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Green Cube: Block index **6**\n    - Orange Cube: Block index **7** (used twice)\n    - Blue Cube: Block index **5**\n    - Yellow Cube: Block index **9**\n    - Orange Triangle Prism: Block index **13** (used three times)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 6, 7, 7, 5, 9, 13, 13, 13\n\n- **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks observed in the main target image. No rotations are needed, and blocks are used as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **7 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of three blocks - two blue blocks on the sides and one yellow block in the middle, placed horizontally on top of the blue blocks.\n    * **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of two blocks - one yellow block placed horizontally on top of the yellow block from the bottom layer, and one red arch block placed on top of the blue blocks from the bottom layer, adjacent to the yellow block.\n    * **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of two orange roof blocks placed on top of the red arch block, forming a roof shape.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The two blue blocks form the base of the structure, placed side-by-side.\n    * The first yellow block is placed horizontally across the middle of the blue blocks, acting as a bridge.\n    * The second yellow block is placed horizontally directly on top of the first yellow block.\n    * The red arch block sits on top of the blue blocks, spanning across them, adjacent to the second yellow block.\n    * The two orange roof blocks are positioned on top of the red arch block, angled to create a roof.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    * Blue Cube (for bottom layer, left): Index **7**\n    * Blue Cube (for bottom layer, right): Index **7**\n    * Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal, bottom layer): Index **9**\n    * Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal, middle layer): Index **9**\n    * Red Arch Block: Index **2**\n    * Orange Roof Block (left side): Index **13**\n    * Orange Roof Block (right side): Index **14**\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 9, 9, 2, 13, 14\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All selected block indices correspond to blocks in the dictionary that match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image without any rotation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

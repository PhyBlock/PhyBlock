Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n\n**Left Structure (House-like):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 6 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of two blue rectangular blocks placed side-by-side.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of one yellow rectangular block placed on top of the two blue blocks, spanning across them.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of one red arch block placed on top of the yellow block. Two orange slanted blocks are placed on top of the red arch, forming a roof.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - Two blue blocks are adjacent horizontally in the base layer.\n    - The yellow block is placed centrally on top of the blue blocks.\n    - The red arch is centered on top of the yellow block.\n    - The two orange slanted blocks are positioned on the sloping sides of the red arch to create a roof shape.\n\n**Right Structure (Train-like):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 7 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of three blocks placed side-by-side: a green rectangular block, a blue cube block, and a yellow cube block.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of an orange cylinder placed next to the yellow cube and partially overlapping the blue cube. A red rectangular block is placed on top of the green rectangular block and the blue cube, adjacent to the orange cylinder.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of a red arch block placed on top of the red rectangular block and the orange cylinder. An orange slanted block is placed on top of the red arch.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - Green, blue, and yellow blocks are adjacent horizontally in the base layer, ordered from left to right.\n    - The orange cylinder is placed to the right of the yellow and blue blocks, partially behind the yellow block.\n    - The red rectangular block is placed on top of the green and blue blocks, to the left of the orange cylinder.\n    - The red arch is placed on top of both the red rectangular block and the orange cylinder, spanning across them.\n    - The orange slanted block is placed on top of the red arch.\n\n## 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**Blocks for the Left Structure (House-like):**\n- Blue Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index 7 (Needed twice)\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index 11\n- Red Arch Block (Horizontal): Index 1\n- Orange Slanted Block (Slanted Right): Index 16 (Needed twice)\n\n**Blocks for the Right Structure (Train-like):**\n- Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index 8\n- Blue Cube Block: Index 4\n- Yellow Cube Block: Index 6\n- Orange Cylinder Block (Vertical): Index 13\n- Red Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index 2\n- Red Arch Block (Horizontal): Index 1\n- Orange Slanted Block (Slanted Left): Index 15\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\n- Left Structure: 7, 7, 11, 1, 16, 16\n- Right Structure: 8, 4, 6, 13, 2, 1, 15\n\n## 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Assembly Instructions for Left Structure (House-like)\": {\n        \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n        \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n        \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n        \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n        \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n        \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n    },\n    \"Assembly Instructions for Right Structure (Train-like)\": {\n        \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n        \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n        \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n        \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n        \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n        \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n        \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n    }\n}\n```"

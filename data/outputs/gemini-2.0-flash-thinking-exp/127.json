Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **9 blocks**.\n    - The structure has **4 layers**.\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Contains a yellow rectangular block, a red curved block, and an orange triangular prism.\n        - **Layer 2:** Contains a red rectangular block, a green rectangular block, and an orange triangular prism.\n        - **Layer 3:** Contains a green rectangular block and a blue cube.\n        - **Layer 4 (Top):** Contains a blue cube.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1:** The yellow rectangular block is at the base, positioned to the left. The red curved block is placed to the right of the yellow block. The orange triangular prism is located behind and slightly to the right of the red curved block.\n    - **Layer 2:** The red rectangular block is placed directly on top of the yellow rectangular block. The green rectangular block is placed on top of the red curved block. The second orange triangular prism is placed on top of the first orange triangular prism, slightly behind the green rectangular block.\n    - **Layer 3:** The green rectangular block is placed on top of the red rectangular block, slightly shifted to the left. The blue cube is placed on top of the green rectangular block, towards the right side.\n    - **Layer 4:** The second blue cube is placed directly on top of the first blue cube.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Yellow Rectangular Block (Layer 1): **Index 9**\n    - Red Curved Block (Layer 1): **Index 1**\n    - Orange Triangular Prism (Layer 1): **Index 14**\n    - Red Rectangular Block (Layer 2): **Index 3**\n    - Green Rectangular Block (Layer 2): **Index 6**\n    - Orange Triangular Prism (Layer 2): **Index 16**\n    - Green Rectangular Block (Layer 3): **Index 5**\n    - Blue Cube (Layer 3): **Index 2**\n    - Blue Cube (Layer 4): **Index 2**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **9 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of 4 blocks - two green rectangular blocks placed side-by-side and two orange triangular blocks, one placed on the outer side of each rectangular block.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle Layer):** Consists of 2 blocks - two orange cylindrical blocks placed on top of the green rectangular blocks of the bottom layer.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top Layer):** Consists of 3 blocks - one red arch block placed centrally on top of the cylindrical blocks and two green rectangular blocks, one on each side of the arch, also on top of the cylindrical blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two green rectangular blocks in the bottom layer are placed horizontally and are adjacent to each other.\n    *   The two orange triangular blocks are placed on the outer sides of the green rectangular blocks, with their longer side along the ground and sloping upwards outwards.\n    *   The two orange cylindrical blocks are placed vertically on top of the green rectangular blocks from the layer below.\n    *   The red arch block is placed centrally on top of the two cylindrical blocks, spanning across them.\n    *   The two green rectangular blocks in the top layer are placed horizontally, one on each side of the red arch block, resting on the cylindrical blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Block Indices:**\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal Orientation): Index **5** (Needed 4 times)\n    *   Orange Triangular Block (Right-Angled Triangle, Sloping Right): Index **13** (Needed 2 times)\n    *   Orange Cylinder Block: Index **9** (Needed 2 times)\n    *   Red Arch Block (Wide Arch, Opening to the Right in Dictionary view): Index **1** (Needed 1 time)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 5, 5, 13, 13, 9, 9, 1, 5, 5\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {5}\n    Step2: Move block with index {5}\n    Step3: Move block with index {13}\n    Step4: Move block with index {13}\n    Step5: Move block with index {9}\n    Step6: Move block with index {9}\n    Step7: Move block with index {1}\n    Step8: Move block with index {5}\n    Step9: Move block with index {5}\n}"

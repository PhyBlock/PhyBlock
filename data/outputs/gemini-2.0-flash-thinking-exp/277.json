Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure on the right side of the Main Target Image is composed of **6 blocks** in **3 layers**.\n    * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** 2 blue blocks.\n    * **Layer 2 (Middle):** 1 yellow block placed on top of the blue blocks.\n    * **Layer 3 (Top):** 1 red arch block placed on the yellow block, and 2 orange triangular blocks forming a roof on top of the red arch block.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * Two blue rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side on the base.\n    * A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of and centered on the two blue blocks.\n    * A red arch block is placed on top of and centered on the yellow block, with the arch facing downwards.\n    * Two orange triangular roof blocks are placed on top of the red arch block, forming a roof shape. They are placed adjacent to each other, angled inwards to meet at the peak.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    * Blue rectangular block (bottom layer): **Index 5** (used twice)\n    * Yellow rectangular block (middle layer): **Index 6**\n    * Red arch block (top layer base): **Index 2**\n    * Orange triangular roof block (top layer): **Index 10** (used twice)\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 5, 5, 6, 2, 10, 10\n\n* **Matching Criteria Confirmation:**\n    * **Shape:** All selected block shapes from the dictionary match the shapes observed in the Main Target Image.\n    * **Color:** The colors (blue, yellow, red, orange) are consistent between the target image and the selected dictionary blocks.\n    * **Rotational Orientation:** The selected block orientations (horizontal yellow block, vertical red arch block, orientation of blue and orange blocks) exactly match those required in the target structure as depicted in the dictionary. No rotation is needed or applied.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the structure and selected blocks, a possible assembly order is from bottom to top, layer by layer:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Chair-like Structure (Left):**\n    *   **Count & Layers:** 6 blocks, 3 layers.\n        *   Layer 1: 4 orange cylinders.\n        *   Layer 2: 2 yellow rectangular prisms.\n        *   Layer 3: 1 green rectangular prism and 1 yellow half-cylinder.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:** Four orange cylinders form the base layer, arranged in a rectangle. Two yellow rectangular prisms are placed horizontally on top of the cylinders, side-by-side, forming the seat. A green rectangular prism is placed vertically on the back edge of one yellow prism, acting as the backrest. A yellow half-cylinder is placed on top of the green prism.\n\n*   **Robot-like Structure (Right):**\n    *   **Count & Layers:** 7 blocks, 4 layers.\n        *   Layer 1: 2 yellow half-cylinders.\n        *   Layer 2: 1 blue cube.\n        *   Layer 3: 1 yellow rectangular prism.\n        *   Layer 4: 1 red U-shaped block, 1 green rectangular prism, 1 orange triangle prism.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:** Two yellow half-cylinders are placed side-by-side as the base. A blue cube is placed centrally on top of the half-cylinders. A yellow rectangular prism is placed horizontally on top of the blue cube. A red U-shaped block is placed on the yellow prism. A green rectangular prism is placed horizontally inside the U-shape, on top of the yellow prism. An orange triangle prism is placed on top of the green prism.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Chair-like Structure:**\n    *   Orange Cylinder: Block 12 (x4)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism (Horizontal): Block 8 (x2)\n    *   Green Rectangular Prism (Vertical): Block 6 (x1)\n    *   Yellow Half-cylinder: Block 13 (x1)\n\n*   **Robot-like Structure:**\n    *   Yellow Half-cylinder: Block 13 (x2)\n    *   Blue Cube: Block 3 (x1)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism (Horizontal): Block 8 (x1)\n    *   Red U-shaped block: Block 1 (x1)\n    *   Green Rectangular Prism (Horizontal): Block 5 (x1)\n    *   Orange Triangle Prism: Block 15 (x1)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n    Step11: Move block with index 3\n    Step12: Move block with index 8\n    Step13: Move block with index 1\n    Step14: Move block with index 5\n    Step15: Move block with index 15\n}"

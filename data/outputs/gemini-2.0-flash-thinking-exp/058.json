Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **8 blocks** and has **6 layers**.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side horizontally, forming the base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A green rectangular block is placed vertically on top of the center of the two red arch blocks in Layer 1.\n    *   **Layer 3:** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side horizontally on top of the green block, oriented perpendicular to the arch blocks in Layer 1.\n    *   **Layer 4:** A green rectangular block is placed vertically on top of the center of the two red arch blocks in Layer 3.\n    *   **Layer 5:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the green block.\n    *   **Layer 6 (Top):** An orange triangular prism is placed on top of the yellow block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For Layer 1 (Red Arch Blocks): Block with index **1** (used twice).\n    *   For Layer 2 (Green Rectangular Block): Block with index **5**.\n    *   For Layer 3 (Red Arch Blocks): Block with index **2** (used twice).\n    *   For Layer 4 (Green Rectangular Block): Block with index **5**.\n    *   For Layer 5 (Yellow Rectangular Block): Block with index **9**.\n    *   For Layer 6 (Orange Triangular Prism): Block with index **15**.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 5, 9, 15\n\n*   **Matching Criteria Confirmation:** All selected blocks exactly match the shape, color, and rotational orientation of the blocks in the target image as depicted in the dictionary. No rotations were applied, and blocks were chosen directly as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** The assembly order is inferred to be layer by layer, starting from the bottom layer and moving upwards.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **6 blocks** and has **5 layers**.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red half-cylinder blocks are placed side-by-side, forming the base. They are oriented horizontally with the curved parts facing outwards.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A blue cube is placed centrally on top of the two red half-cylinder blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the blue cube, wider than the cube and aligned in the same direction as the base blocks.\n    *   **Layer 4:** A red rectangular block with an arch is placed horizontally on top of the green block, aligned with the green block and base blocks. The arch is facing forward.\n    *   **Layer 5 (Top):** An orange triangular prism (roof shape) is placed centrally on top of the red arched block, oriented with its longest edge aligned with the blocks below.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks & Block Indices:**\n    *   For the base layer (two red half-cylinders): We need block index **1** twice.\n    *   For the second layer (blue cube): We need block index **7**.\n    *   For the third layer (green rectangular block): We need block index **10**.\n    *   For the fourth layer (red arched block): We need block index **2**.\n    *   For the top layer (orange triangular prism): We need block index **13**.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 7, 10, 2, 13\n\n*   **Matching Criteria Confirmation:** All selected block indices correspond to blocks in the dictionary that exactly match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No rotation is needed, and blocks are used as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** The assembly order is inferred to be layer by layer, starting from the bottom and moving upwards.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

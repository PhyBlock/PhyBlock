Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The left structure in the main target image is composed of **5 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 1 yellow rectangular block, oriented horizontally.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 3 cubic blocks arranged horizontally from left to right: green, blue, and red.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 1 yellow rectangular block, oriented horizontally, placed on top of the middle layer.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer serves as the base, with the horizontal yellow block resting directly on the surface.\n    *   The middle layer blocks (green, blue, red) are placed side-by-side on top of the base yellow block, forming a horizontal row. The green block is on the left, followed by the blue block in the center, and the red block on the right.\n    *   The top layer yellow block is positioned directly above and centered on the middle layer, spanning across all three blocks (green, blue, red) of the middle layer.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Block Indices:**\n    *   **Bottom Yellow Rectangular Block:** Block index **11** (horizontal yellow rectangular block).\n    *   **Green Cubic Block:** Block index **2** (green cube).\n    *   **Blue Cubic Block:** Block index **1** (blue cube).\n    *   **Red Cubic Block:** Block index **3** (red cube).\n    *   **Top Yellow Rectangular Block:** Block index **11** (horizontal yellow rectangular block).\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 11, 2, 1, 3, 11\n\n*   **Matching Criteria Confirmation:** All selected blocks from the dictionary match the target image in shape, color, and rotational orientation. No rotation is needed, and the blocks are used exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** A logical assembly order is to build the structure layer by layer, starting from the bottom.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```"

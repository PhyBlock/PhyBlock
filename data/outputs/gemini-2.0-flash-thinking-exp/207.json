Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **9 blocks** in total.\n    *   The structure has **4 layers**.\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 4 blocks (2 yellow semi-circles, 1 blue cube, 1 green cube).\n        *   **Layer 2:** Consists of 1 block (1 red block with a hole).\n        *   **Layer 3:** Consists of 1 block (1 yellow rectangular block).\n        *   **Layer 4 (Top):** Consists of 3 blocks (2 orange cylinders, 1 orange triangular roof).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Two yellow semi-circular blocks are placed side-by-side horizontally. A blue cube is placed adjacent to the right side of the right semi-circular block. A green cube is placed adjacent to the left side of the left semi-circular block.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A red block with a hole is placed centrally on top of the two yellow semi-circular blocks and partially overlapping the blue and green cubes. The orientation of the hole is facing towards the viewer.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the red block. It is centered on the red block and oriented lengthwise along the same direction as the semi-circular blocks.\n    *   **Layer 4:** Two orange cylinders are placed vertically on top of the yellow rectangular block, side-by-side, towards the back edge of the rectangular block. An orange triangular roof block is placed on top of the two cylinders, forming a roof shape.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Yellow semi-circle (for bottom layer): **Index 13** (needed twice)\n    *   Blue cube (for bottom layer): **Index 4** (needed once)\n    *   Green cube (for bottom layer): **Index 5** (needed once)\n    *   Red block with hole (for middle layer): **Index 1** (needed once)\n    *   Yellow rectangular block (for upper layer): **Index 8** (needed once)\n    *   Orange cylinder (for top layer): **Index 9** (needed twice)\n    *   Orange triangular roof (for top layer): **Index 16** (needed once)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

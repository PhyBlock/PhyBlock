Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **7 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 orange cylinder blocks laid horizontally side-by-side.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 1 yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the cylinder blocks.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 4 blocks: 1 blue cube, 1 vertical yellow rectangular block, and 2 orange wedge blocks forming a roof shape.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - The two orange cylinder blocks are on the ground level, supporting the entire structure.\n    - The yellow rectangular block (horizontal) rests directly on top of the two cylinders, spanning across them.\n    - On the yellow rectangular block (horizontal):\n        - A blue cube is placed on the left side.\n        - A vertical yellow rectangular block is placed on the right side.\n        - Two orange wedge blocks are placed on top of the blue cube, angled inwards to form a roof shape.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the bottom layer cylinders: We need two horizontal orange cylinders, which correspond to **index 8** (or 9, both are suitable). We will use index 8 twice.\n    - For the middle layer rectangular block: We need a horizontal yellow rectangular block, which corresponds to **index 4** (or 6 or 7, all are suitable). We will use index 4.\n    - For the top layer blue cube: We need a blue cube, which corresponds to **index 1**.\n    - For the top layer vertical yellow rectangular block: We need a vertical yellow rectangular block, which corresponds to **index 5**.\n    - For the roof wedges: We need two orange wedges oriented to form a roof on top of the cube. **Index 15** and **index 16** are suitable, representing wedges angled upwards to the left and right, respectively.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 8, 8, 4, 1, 5, 15, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 15\n   Step7: Move block with index 16\n}\n```"

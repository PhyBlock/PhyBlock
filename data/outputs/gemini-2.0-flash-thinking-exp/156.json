Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Tall Tower - Left side of the image):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 7 blocks and has 5 distinct layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red arch blocks placed side-by-side horizontally, forming the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** One red arch block placed on top of the center of the base layer, oriented perpendicularly to the base layer.\n    - **Layer 3:** One green rectangular block placed vertically on top of the red arch block from Layer 2.\n    - **Layer 4:** One yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the green block from Layer 3, and another green rectangular block placed vertically adjacent to the yellow block, resting on the red arch block of layer 2.\n    - **Layer 5 (Top):** One orange triangular prism placed on top of the yellow rectangular block from Layer 4.\n\n**Structure 2 (Short Structure - Right side of the image):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 4 blocks and has 3 distinct layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** One red arch block placed horizontally as the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** One yellow semi-circle block placed on top of the red arch block from Layer 1, centered.\n    - **Layer 3:** One green rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the yellow semi-circle block from Layer 2.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top):** One red arch block placed horizontally on top of the green rectangular block from Layer 3.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Tall Tower):**\n- For Layer 1 (Base): We need two red arch blocks oriented as in block index **1**.\n- For Layer 2: We need one red arch block oriented as in block index **2**.\n- For Layer 3: We need one green rectangular block oriented as in block index **8**.\n- For Layer 4 (Horizontal): We need one yellow rectangular block oriented as in block index **9**.\n- For Layer 4 (Vertical adjacent): We need one green rectangular block oriented as in block index **7**.\n- For Layer 5 (Top): We need one orange triangular prism oriented as in block index **11**.\n\n**Block Indices for Structure 1:** 1, 1, 2, 8, 7, 9, 11\n\n**Structure 2 (Short Structure):**\n- For Layer 1 (Base): We need one red arch block oriented as in block index **2**.\n- For Layer 2: We need one yellow semi-circle block oriented as in block index **10**.\n- For Layer 3: We need one green rectangular block oriented as in block index **5**.\n- For Layer 4 (Top): We need one red arch block oriented as in block index **1**.\n\n**Block Indices for Structure 2:** 2, 10, 5, 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 1 (Tall Tower):**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 2 (Short Structure):**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **6 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 yellow arch blocks.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 red arch blocks placed on top of the yellow blocks.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 2 red rectangular blocks placed on top of the red arch blocks.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - In the bottom layer, two yellow arch blocks are placed side-by-side, with their arched openings facing outwards.\n    - In the middle layer, two red arch blocks are placed directly on top of the yellow blocks, also side-by-side and with their arched openings facing outwards, aligned with the blocks below.\n    - In the top layer, two red rectangular blocks are placed horizontally across the middle layer, spanning across both red arch blocks. They are placed adjacent to each other.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the bottom layer (yellow arches): We need two blocks matching the shape and orientation of **Block 9** from the dictionary.\n    - For the middle layer (red arches): We need two blocks matching the shape and orientation of **Block 1** from the dictionary.\n    - For the top layer (red rectangular): We need two blocks matching the shape and orientation of **Block 2** from the dictionary.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 9, 9, 1, 1, 2, 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {9}\n    Step2: Move block with index {9}\n    Step3: Move block with index {1}\n    Step4: Move block with index {1}\n    Step5: Move block with index {2}\n    Step6: Move block with index {2}\n}"

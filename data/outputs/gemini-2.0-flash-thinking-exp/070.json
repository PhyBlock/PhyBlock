Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **5 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side, with their arched openings facing inwards (towards each other).\n    * **Layer 2 (Middle):** A single yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two red blocks in the first layer. It spans across both red blocks, acting as a bridge.\n    * **Layer 3 (Top):** Two red arch blocks are placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, again side-by-side.  However, in this layer, the arched openings are facing outwards (away from each other), opposite to the direction of the arches in the bottom layer.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    * For the **bottom layer**, we need two red arch blocks with the arch facing in a specific direction. Looking at the dictionary, Block **1** and Block **2** appear to be suitable. Block **1** seems to be oriented correctly for the right side of the bottom layer, and Block **2** for the left side.\n    * For the **middle layer**, we need a horizontal yellow rectangular block. Block **10** from the dictionary perfectly matches this description.\n    * For the **top layer**, we need two red arch blocks, but this time with the arch facing the opposite direction compared to the bottom layer. Blocks **3** and **4** seem to fit this. Block **4** looks appropriate for the right side of the top layer, and Block **3** for the left side.\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 2, 10, 4, 3\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the layers and block selections, a plausible assembly order is to start from the bottom layer and move upwards:\n\n* **Step 1:** Place the first red arch block for the bottom layer (let's choose the right one first). This corresponds to Block **1**.\n* **Step 2:** Place the second red arch block for the bottom layer (the left one), adjacent to the first. This corresponds to Block **2**.\n* **Step 3:** Place the yellow rectangular block on top of the two red blocks, forming the middle layer. This is Block **10**.\n* **Step 4:** Place the first red arch block for the top layer (right side) on top of the yellow block. This is Block **4**.\n* **Step 5:** Place the second red arch block for the top layer (left side) on top of the yellow block, adjacent to the previous one. This is Block **3**.\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 3\"\n}\n```"

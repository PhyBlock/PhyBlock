Let's focus on describing the right-side structure as it appears to be more complex and potentially the intended \"structure\" for assembly based on the instructions.\n\n**Right-Side Structure Analysis:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The right-side structure is composed of 7 blocks and has approximately 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** An orange triangular block is placed in front, and a vertical orange cylinder forms the main base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the vertical orange cylinder.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the green rectangular block, slightly offset to the right. A blue cube is placed on the left side of the yellow rectangular block, towards the front.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top):** A red curved block is placed on top of the blue cube and extends over the yellow rectangular block. A yellow curved block is placed on top of the red curved block.\n\n**Left-Side Structure Analysis (for completeness, although focusing on the right one):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The left-side structure (train) is composed of 4 blocks and has 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Two orange cylinders are placed horizontally side-by-side.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two orange cylinders. A blue cube is placed on the left end of the yellow rectangular block.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary (for the Right-Side Structure):\n\nBased on the analysis of the right-side structure, the required blocks from the dictionary are:\n\n*   Orange Triangle Block (base front): Block 15\n*   Orange Cylinder (vertical base): Block 10\n*   Green Rectangular Block (horizontal): Block 5\n*   Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal): Block 6\n*   Blue Cube: Block 3\n*   Red Curved Block: Block 1\n*   Yellow Curved Block (top): Block 12\n\n## Determine the Assembly Order (for the Right-Side Structure):\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {15}\n    Step2: Move block with index {10}\n    Step3: Move block with index {5}\n    Step4: Move block with index {6}\n    Step5: Move block with index {3}\n    Step6: Move block with index {1}\n    Step7: Move block with index {12}\n}"

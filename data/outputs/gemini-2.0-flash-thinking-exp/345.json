Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **17 blocks** and has **3 layers** at its highest point.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** The base layer consists of four red arch blocks arranged linearly from left to right, forming two sets of arches with a small gap in between.\n    *   **Second Layer (Left Section):** On the left set of arches (first two arches), there are two green rectangular blocks placed side-by-side, spanning across both arches.\n    *   **Second Layer (Right Section):** On the right set of arches (last two arches), there is one yellow semi-circle block placed on the left arch and one yellow rectangular block placed on the right arch.\n    *   **Third Layer (Left Section):** On top of the green rectangular blocks (left section), there is a blue cube on the left and a yellow rectangular block on the right.\n    *   **Third Layer (Right Section):** On top of the yellow semi-circle block (left arch of right set), there is a vertical green rectangular block. On top of the yellow rectangular block (right arch of right set), there are two vertical yellow rectangular blocks placed side by side.\n    *   **Top Layer (Right Section):** On top of the vertical green rectangular block, there is an orange cube. On top of the two vertical yellow rectangular blocks, there is a red house-roof block on the left and an orange house-roof block on the right.\n    *   There is one additional green rectangular block placed at the far right end on the base layer, next to the rightmost arch.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch (base layer): Block 1 (x4)\n    *   Green Rectangular (horizontal, layer 2 left): Block 4 (x2)\n    *   Yellow Semi-circle (layer 2 right): Block 12 (x1)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular (horizontal, layer 2 right): Block 9 (x1)\n    *   Blue Cube (layer 3 left): Block 3 (x1)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular (horizontal, layer 3 left): Block 9 (x1)\n    *   Green Rectangular (vertical, layer 3 right): Block 8 (x1)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular (vertical, layer 3 right): Block 11 (x2)\n    *   Orange Cube (top right): Block 5 (x1)\n    *   Red House-roof (top right): Block 15 (x1)\n    *   Orange House-roof (top right): Block 16 (x1)\n    *   Green Rectangular (horizontal, base layer right end): Block 4 (x1)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices (in order of appearance in the structure, roughly bottom to top, left to right):** 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 12, 9, 3, 9, 8, 11, 11, 5, 15, 16, 4\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step17\": \"Move block with index 4\"\n}\n```"

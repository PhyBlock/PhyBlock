Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Chair Structure:**\n- **Count & Layers:** 5 blocks, 4 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Base):** A green vertical rectangular block is at the bottom.\n    - **Layer 2 (Legs):** A yellow horizontal rectangular block is placed on top of the green block, acting as the legs support.\n    - **Layer 3 (Seat):** Two blocks are placed side-by-side on top of the yellow block: a red cube on the left and a blue cube on the right, forming the seat.\n    - **Layer 4 (Back & Top):** A yellow horizontal rectangular block is placed on top of the red and blue cubes, forming the back of the chair. A yellow curved block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, finishing the chair back.\n\n**House Structure:**\n- **Count & Layers:** 7 blocks, 4 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Base):** Two blue cube blocks are placed side by side, forming the base of the house.\n    - **Layer 2 (Body):** A red cube block is placed on the left blue base block, and a green horizontal rectangular block is placed on the right blue base block.\n    - **Layer 3 (Roof):** Two orange triangular blocks are placed on top of the red and green blocks, angled to form a roof shape.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top Roof):** An orange cube block is placed on top of the two orange triangular blocks, at the peak of the roof.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Blocks for Chair:**\n- Green vertical rectangular block: Index 6\n- Yellow horizontal rectangular block: Index 8 (used twice)\n- Red cube block: Index 3\n- Blue cube block: Index 4\n- Yellow curved block: Index 9\n\n**Blocks for House:**\n- Blue cube block: Index 4 (used twice)\n- Red cube block: Index 3\n- Green horizontal rectangular block: Index 5\n- Orange triangular block: Index 11 (used twice)\n- Orange cube block: Index 2\n\n**Block Indices List:**\n- Chair: 6, 8, 3, 4, 8, 9\n- House: 4, 4, 3, 5, 11, 11, 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n   Step7: Move block with index 4\n   Step8: Move block with index 4\n   Step9: Move block with index 3\n   Step10: Move block with index 5\n   Step11: Move block with index 11\n   Step12: Move block with index 11\n   Step13: Move block with index 2\n}"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **14 blocks** in total.\n    *   It has **4 layers** at its highest point (considering the left structure with the roof). The right structure is also roughly 4 layers at its peak.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   The base layer consists of two orange cylinders placed horizontally and side-by-side.\n        *   A yellow rectangular prism is placed horizontally on top of these cylinders, acting as the second layer.\n        *   A blue cube is positioned centrally on top of the yellow prism, forming the third layer.\n        *   An orange half-cylinder roof block is placed on top of the blue cube, completing the fourth layer.\n    *   **Right Structure:**\n        *   The base layer is formed by four orange cylinders standing vertically in a row, closely spaced.\n        *   A yellow rectangular prism is placed horizontally on top of these cylinders, forming the second layer.\n        *   Another yellow rectangular prism is placed horizontally on top of the first yellow prism, creating the third layer.\n        *   Two orange triangular roof blocks are placed side-by-side on one side of the upper yellow prism (layer 3).\n        *   A third orange triangular roof block is placed on top of the other side of the upper yellow prism and also resting on the top of the vertical cylinders (layer 4).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Blue Cube: Index **1** (Quantity: 1)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism (Horizontal): Index **5** (Quantity: 1), Index **6** (Quantity: 2)\n    *   Orange Cylinder (Horizontal): Index **9** (Quantity: 2)\n    *   Orange Cylinder (Vertical): Index **8** (Quantity: 4)\n    *   Orange Triangular Roof: Index **13** (Quantity: 3)\n    *   Orange Half-cylinder Roof: Index **14** (Quantity: 1)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

A blue cube is positioned on top of the right semi-circular block, slightly offset towards the center of the combined base.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 5 blocks and has 3 distinct layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Base):** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side, forming the foundation.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Two orange cylindrical blocks are positioned vertically on top of the yellow rectangular blocks, acting as pillars. Each cylinder is placed on one yellow block.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** A red arch block is placed horizontally across the tops of the two orange cylindrical pillars, spanning the gap between them. An orange triangular prism block is placed on top of the center of the red arch block, forming the peak of the structure.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Red semi-circular block (horizontal orientation): Block index **2** (used twice)\n- Blue cube: Block index **6** (used once)\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation): Block index **9** (used twice)\n- Orange cylindrical block (vertical orientation): Block index **12** (used twice)\n- Red arch block: Block index **1** (used once)\n- Orange triangular roof block: Block index **14** (used once)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 6, 9, 9, 12, 12, 1, 14\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

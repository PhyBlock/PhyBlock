Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **9 blocks** in total.\n    - The structure has **4 layers** at its highest point (the tower on the right). The left structure also has 4 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Left Structure:**\n        - It is a vertical stack of four arch blocks.\n        - From bottom to top, the blocks are Red, Yellow, Green, and Red.\n        - All arch openings face to the right.\n    - **Right Structure:**\n        - The base layer consists of two Orange cylindrical blocks placed side-by-side horizontally.\n        - On top of the cylindrical blocks is a Yellow rectangular arch block placed horizontally, with the arch opening upwards.\n        - On top of the Yellow arch block is an Orange rectangular arch block placed vertically, with the arch opening to the right.\n        - The topmost block is an Orange triangular prism placed on top of the vertical Orange arch block.\n        - The right structure is positioned to the right of the left structure with a small gap in between.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the **Left Structure**:\n        - Bottom Red Arch Block: Index **1**\n        - Yellow Arch Block: Index **11**\n        - Green Arch Block: Index **12**\n        - Top Red Arch Block: Index **1**\n    - For the **Right Structure**:\n        - Base Cylinder (left): Index **10**\n        - Base Cylinder (right): Index **10**\n        - Yellow Horizontal Arch Block: Index **8**\n        - Orange Vertical Arch Block: Index **2**\n        - Orange Triangular Prism: Index **14**\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 11, 12, 1, 10, 10, 8, 2, 14\n\n* **Matching Criteria Confirmation:**\n    - All selected block indices correspond to blocks in the dictionary that match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No rotations are needed.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n   \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n   \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n   \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n   \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n   \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n   \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n   \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n   \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

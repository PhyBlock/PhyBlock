Two orange triangular prism blocks are placed on top of the red rectangular block, forming a pointed roof.\n\n    - **Right Structure:**\n        - **Layer 1 (Base):** Three red arch blocks placed side-by-side in a row.\n        - **Layer 2:** A yellow arch block is placed in the center on top of the red arches. A green rectangular block (vertical orientation) is placed to the right of the yellow arch, and a yellow rectangular block (vertical orientation) is placed to the left of the yellow arch.\n        - **Layer 3 (Top):** A blue cube is placed on top of the yellow arch. A yellow rectangular block (vertical orientation) is placed on top of the green rectangular block. An orange cube is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n\n## Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index 7 (Used 3 times)\n    - Orange Cylinder: Index 10 (Used 2 times)\n    - Red Arch Block: Index 1 (Used 4 times)\n    - Orange Triangular Prism Block: Index 15 (Used 2 times)\n    - Yellow Arch Block: Index 12 (Used 1 time)\n    - Green Rectangular Block (Vertical): Index 6 (Used 1 time)\n    - Yellow Rectangular Block (Vertical): Index 8 (Used 2 times)\n    - Blue Cube: Index 4 (Used 1 time)\n    - Orange Cube: Index 5 (Used 1 time)\n    - Red Rectangular Block (Horizontal - looks like arch in dictionary but functions as rectangle in target): Index 1 (Used 1 time - used as roof base)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 10, 10, 7, 1, 15, 15, 1, 1, 1, 12, 6, 8, 4, 8, 5\n\n## Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 8\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 8\n    Step14: Move block with index 1\n    Step15: Move block with index 5\n    Step16: Move block with index 15\n    Step17: Move block with index 15\n}\n```"

Two red triangular prism blocks are used - one placed on top of the other green cube, and the second one on top of the blue cube, forming a small sloped roof.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is built linearly. The red arches are at the base, supporting the yellow rectangle, which in turn supports the green cubes, and finally the blue cube and red triangular prisms are placed on top.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Block Count:** 6 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A single yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally as the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** Two orange cylinder blocks are placed side-by-side on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** A red arch block is placed on top of the two orange cylinder blocks. Two red triangular prism blocks are placed on top of the red arch block, forming a roof shape.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** Similar to the first structure, it's built in layers. The yellow rectangle forms the base, supporting the orange cylinders, which then support the red arch and finally the red triangular prism roof.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**For Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Layer 1: Two red arch blocks - **Index 1** (used twice)\n- Layer 2: One yellow rectangular block - **Index 10**\n- Layer 3: Two green cube blocks - **Index 6** (used twice)\n- Layer 4: One blue cube block - **Index 5**\n- Layer 4: Two red triangular prism blocks - **Index 15** (used twice)\n\n**For Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Layer 1: One yellow rectangular block - **Index 10**\n- Layer 2: Two orange cylinder blocks - **Index 12** (used twice)\n- Layer 3: One red arch block - **Index 2**\n- Layer 3: Two red triangular prism blocks - **Index 16** (used twice)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 10, 6, 6, 5, 15, 15, 10, 12, 12, 2, 16, 16\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

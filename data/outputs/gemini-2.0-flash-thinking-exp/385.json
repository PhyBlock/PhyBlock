The structure has a maximum of **4 layers** in the right part and **3 layers** in the left part.\n    - **Spatial Relationships:**\n        - **Left Structure:** This structure is made of two identical stacks. Each stack has a red arch block at the bottom, a yellow rectangular block in the middle, and another red arch block on top. The two stacks are placed side-by-side with arches facing each other.\n        - **Right Structure:** This structure has a base of two green rectangular blocks placed side-by-side vertically. On top of these, there are two yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally. An orange cylinder is placed vertically on top of the yellow blocks, and a yellow half-dome is placed on top of the cylinder. The right structure is placed to the right and slightly behind the left structure.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n    - **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n        - Red Arch Block (Horizontal Orientation): Index **2** (Needed 4 times)\n        - Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal Orientation): Index **8** (Needed 2 times) and Index **9** (Needed 2 times)\n        - Green Rectangular Block (Vertical Orientation): Index **6** (Needed 2 times)\n        - Orange Cylinder Block (Vertical Orientation): Index **10** (Needed 1 time)\n        - Yellow Half-Dome Block: Index **12** (Needed 1 time)\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n    - **Assembly Sequence:**\n        ```json\n        {\n            \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n            \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n            \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n            \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n            \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n            \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n            \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n            \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n            \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n            \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n            \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n            \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n        }\n        ```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 4 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Consists of two yellow half-cylinder blocks placed side-by-side to form a cylindrical base.\n    *   Layer 2 (Middle): A green rectangular prism placed vertically on top of the yellow cylindrical base.\n    *   Layer 3 (Top): An orange cylinder placed horizontally on top of the green rectangular prism.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two yellow half-cylinder blocks are placed adjacent to each other horizontally on the ground level, forming a cylindrical base.\n    *   The green rectangular prism is placed vertically, centered on top of the combined yellow cylindrical base.\n    *   The orange cylinder is placed horizontally, centered on top of the green rectangular prism.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n    *   For the base layer (yellow cylinders): Block index **10** (used twice).\n    *   For the middle layer (green rectangular prism): Block index **3**.\n    *   For the top layer (orange cylinder): Block index **7**.\n*   **Block Indices List:** 10, 10, 3, 7\n*   **Matching Criteria:**\n    *   Block 10 (Yellow Half-Cylinder - index 10) matches the yellow half-cylinder shape and orientation needed for the base. Two of these are required to form the cylindrical base as seen in the target image.\n    *   Block 3 (Green Rectangular Prism - index 3) matches the green rectangular prism shape and vertical orientation needed for the middle layer.\n    *   Block 7 (Orange Cylinder - index 7) matches the orange cylinder shape and horizontal orientation needed for the top layer.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n}\n```"

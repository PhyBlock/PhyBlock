Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **14 blocks** in total.\n    *   It is built in **3 distinct layers**.\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 3 red arch blocks, 3 green rectangular blocks, and 4 orange cylindrical blocks.\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 3 yellow rectangular blocks, placed on top of the orange cylindrical blocks.\n        *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 1 yellow semi-circular block, placed on top of the yellow rectangular blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Section:** Three red arch blocks are placed side-by-side horizontally, forming a base. Three green rectangular blocks are placed on top of these red arch blocks, also side-by-side horizontally.\n    *   **Right Section:** Four orange cylindrical blocks are arranged in a rectangular formation (2x2) as a base. Three yellow rectangular blocks are placed on top of these orange cylindrical blocks, arranged horizontally in a line. A single yellow semi-circular block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular blocks, seemingly in the center of the line.\n    *   The left and right sections are placed adjacent to each other on the ground level.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch Block (Horizontal): Index **1** (Needed 3 times)\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index **7** (Needed 3 times)\n    *   Orange Cylindrical Block (Vertical): Index **12** (Needed 4 times)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index **11** (Needed 3 times)\n    *   Yellow Semi-circular Block: Index **14** (Needed 1 time)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

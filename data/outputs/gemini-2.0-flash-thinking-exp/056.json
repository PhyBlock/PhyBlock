A logical assembly order is as follows: place the three arch blocks side-by-side, then place the green, red, and blue cubes on top of the arch blocks, and finally place the yellow cube on top of the blue cube.\n\n    *   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n}\n```"

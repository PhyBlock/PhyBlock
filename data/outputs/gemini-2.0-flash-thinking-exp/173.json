From the dictionary, **Block 15** is a vertical orange cylinder. We need to use Block 15 three times.\n- **Green Rectangular Blocks (Layer 2):** We need 2 green rectangular blocks in a horizontal orientation. From the dictionary, **Block 8** is a horizontal green rectangular block. We need to use Block 8 two times.\n\n**For Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Yellow Rectangular Blocks (Front/Back):** We need 2 yellow rectangular blocks in a horizontal orientation along the depth axis. From the dictionary, **Block 13** or **Block 14** are suitable. Let's choose **Block 13** and use it twice.\n- **Red Curved Block (Middle):** We need 1 red curved block with a semi-circular cutout in a horizontal orientation. From the dictionary, **Block 2** matches this description. We need to use Block 2 once.\n- **Green Rectangular Blocks (Sides):** We need 2 green rectangular blocks in a vertical orientation. From the dictionary, **Block 10** is a vertical green rectangular block. We need to use Block 10 twice.\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\n- For Structure 1: Block 15 (x3), Block 8 (x2)\n- For Structure 2: Block 13 (x2), Block 2 (x1), Block 10 (x2)\n\n## Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n**Assembly Order for Structure 1 (Left) and then Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```"

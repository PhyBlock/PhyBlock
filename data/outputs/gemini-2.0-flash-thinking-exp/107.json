Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **5 blocks** in total.\n    *   The structure has **3 layers**.\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Consists of 3 blocks (2 curved yellow and 1 rectangular yellow).\n        *   Layer 2 (Middle): Consists of 1 block (rectangular yellow).\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): Consists of 1 block (triangular red).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Two yellow curved blocks are placed side-by-side at the base. A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of these two curved blocks, bridging across them.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally directly on top of the yellow rectangular block from Layer 1. It is aligned in the same orientation and position as the block below it.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A red triangular prism block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block from Layer 2. It is positioned centrally, with its longer axis aligned with the length of the rectangular block below.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Block Indices:**\n    *   For the base curved yellow blocks (Layer 1): We need **two** blocks of index **5**.\n    *   For the bottom rectangular yellow block (Layer 1 & Layer 2): We need **two** blocks of index **2**.\n    *   For the top triangular red prism block (Layer 3): We need **one** block of index **14**.\n\n*   **List Block Indices:** 5, 5, 2, 2, 14\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:**\n    *   Block 5 (curved yellow) matches the shape, color, and orientation of the curved yellow blocks in the target image's base.\n    *   Block 2 (horizontal rectangular yellow) matches the shape, color, and horizontal orientation of the rectangular yellow blocks in the target image's middle and bottom layers.\n    *   Block 14 (triangular red prism) matches the shape, color, and orientation of the triangular red prism block at the top of the target image.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** We will assemble the structure layer by layer, starting from the bottom.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

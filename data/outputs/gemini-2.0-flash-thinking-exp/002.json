Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **6 blocks** in total and has **2 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of 4 orange cylindrical blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Top Layer):** Consists of 2 green rectangular blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The four orange cylindrical blocks are arranged in a square formation, forming the base of the structure. They are placed adjacent to each other, creating a stable platform.\n    *   The two green rectangular blocks are placed on top of the cylindrical base, side-by-side and horizontally oriented. They are positioned such that they span across two cylinders each, effectively resting on the base layer. The green blocks are aligned along one axis of the square base formed by the cylinders.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   For the orange cylindrical base, we need 4 blocks of the same type and orientation.\n    *   For the green top layer, we need 2 blocks of the same type and orientation.\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   **Orange Cylindrical Blocks:** Observing the dictionary, block index **7** shows an orange cylinder in a vertical orientation, which matches the cylinders in the target image's base layer. We will use block index **7** four times.\n    *   **Green Rectangular Blocks:** Observing the dictionary, block index **1** shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, which matches the rectangular blocks in the target image's top layer. We will use block index **1** twice.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 1.\n\n*   **Matching Criteria Check:**\n    *   **Shape:** Cylindrical and rectangular blocks are correctly identified and matched.\n    *   **Color:** Orange and green colors are correctly matched.\n    *   **Rotational Orientation:** Block index 7 and block index 1 are selected to precisely match the orientation of the blocks in the main target image without any rotation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:**  A logical assembly order would be to first place the base layer of cylindrical blocks and then place the top layer of rectangular blocks on top. Within each layer, the order of placement is not strictly defined by the image, but a reasonable sequence would be to place the base cylinders first and then add the top rectangular blocks.\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```"

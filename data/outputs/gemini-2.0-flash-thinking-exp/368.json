Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **17 blocks** and has approximately **4 layers** at its highest point.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Bottom Layer:** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side on the left. A horizontal yellow rectangular block is placed immediately to the right of the second red arch. Another red arch block is placed to the right of the yellow rectangular block. Two orange triangular blocks are placed side-by-side on the far right, forming a slanted base.\n    - **Second Layer:** A horizontal green rectangular block is placed on top of the two red arch blocks from the bottom layer. A red arch block is positioned above the yellow rectangular block from the bottom layer. Another horizontal green rectangular block is placed above the red arch from the bottom layer. An orange triangular block is placed on top of the two orange triangular blocks from the bottom layer.\n    - **Third Layer:** Two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side, positioned above the first green rectangular block and the red arch from the second layer. A horizontal green rectangular block is placed above the second green rectangular block from the second layer.\n    - **Fourth Layer (Top Layer):** Two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side, positioned above the two yellow rectangular blocks from the third layer. Two blue cube blocks are placed side-by-side, positioned above the green rectangular block from the third layer.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Red Arch (Horizontal Orientation): Block 1 (used 2 times), Block 2 (used 2 times)\n    - Yellow Rectangle (Horizontal Orientation): Block 9 (used 5 times)\n    - Green Rectangle (Horizontal Orientation): Block 6 (used 3 times)\n    - Orange Triangle (Slanted Orientation): Block 12 (used 3 times)\n    - Blue Cube: Block 4 (used 2 times)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 9, 2, 12, 12, 6, 2, 6, 12, 9, 9, 6, 9, 9, 4, 4\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step17\": \"Move block with index 4\"\n}\n```"

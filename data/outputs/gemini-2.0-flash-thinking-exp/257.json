It has a maximum of 3 layers in both the left and right sections.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Right Structure:** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side on the bottom layer. Two shorter yellow rectangular blocks are placed on top of these arches in the middle layer. Two more red arch blocks are placed on top of the yellow blocks in the top layer, aligned with the arches below.\n    *   **Left Structure:** Three orange cylinder blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side on the bottom layer. A longer yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the cylinders, spanning across them. A blue cube is placed on top of the yellow rectangle towards the left side. An orange roof block is placed on top of the blue cube. The left structure is positioned to the left of the right structure in the image.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch (for right structure, bottom and top layers): Block index **1** (needed 4 times)\n    *   Shorter Yellow Rectangle (for right structure, middle layer): Block index **10** (needed 2 times)\n    *   Orange Cylinder (for left structure, bottom layer): Block index **12** (needed 3 times)\n    *   Longer Yellow Rectangle (for left structure, middle layer): Block index **9** (needed 1 time)\n    *   Blue Cube (for left structure, top layer): Block index **6** (needed 1 time)\n    *   Orange Roof (for left structure, top layer): Block index **16** (needed 1 time)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 10, 10, 1, 1, 12, 12, 12, 9, 6, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

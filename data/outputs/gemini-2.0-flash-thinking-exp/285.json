Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Tall Structure):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 5 blocks and has 4 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Three orange cylinder blocks are placed horizontally and adjacent to each other in a row, forming the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** A green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the center cylinder of the base layer, spanning across all three cylinders.\n    - **Layer 3:** A red cube is placed centrally on top of the green rectangular block.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top Layer):** A blue cube is placed centrally on top of the red cube.\n\n**Structure 2 (Triangular Structure):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 2 blocks and has 2 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** An orange triangular prism block is placed lying flat on its long rectangular face.\n    - **Layer 2 (Top Layer):** A blue cube is placed centrally on top of the flat rectangular face of the triangular prism block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**For Structure 1 (Tall Structure):**\n- **Layer 1 (Cylinders):** We need three horizontal orange cylinder blocks. This corresponds to **Block Index 9** (used three times).\n- **Layer 2 (Green Rectangular):** We need a horizontal green rectangular block. This corresponds to **Block Index 4**.\n- **Layer 3 (Red Cube):** We need a red cube. This corresponds to **Block Index 2**.\n- **Layer 4 (Blue Cube):** We need a blue cube. This corresponds to **Block Index 1**.\n\n**For Structure 2 (Triangular Structure):**\n- **Layer 1 (Orange Triangular Prism):** We need an orange triangular prism lying flat. This corresponds to **Block Index 12**.\n- **Layer 2 (Blue Cube):** We need a blue cube. This corresponds to **Block Index 1**.\n\n**List of Block Indices for both structures:** 1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 9, 9, 12\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the assembly order for both structures can be described as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```"

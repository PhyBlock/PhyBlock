A green arch block is placed on top, spanning across the two rectangular blocks.\n    - **Layer 2:** Two orange wedge blocks are placed on the sides, partially on the base green rectangular blocks and partially extending outwards. A red arch block is placed on top, spanning across the green arch block and the two orange wedge blocks.\n    - **Layer 3:** A green square block is placed on the left side, sitting on top of one orange wedge block and the red arch block. A blue cube block is placed on the right side, sitting on top of the other orange wedge block and the red arch block.\n    - **Layer 4:** Two orange wedge blocks are placed on the top, one on top of the green square block and the other on top of the blue cube block.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Layer 1:**\n    - Green Rectangular Block (horizontal orientation): Index 11 (Used twice)\n    - Green Arch Block: Index 1 (Used once)\n- **Layer 2:**\n    - Orange Wedge Block: Index 13 (Used twice)\n    - Red Arch Block: Index 2 (Used once)\n- **Layer 3:**\n    - Green Square Block: Index 8 (Used once)\n    - Blue Cube Block: Index 7 (Used once)\n- **Layer 4:**\n    - Orange Wedge Block: Index 13 (Used twice)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 11, 11, 1, 13, 13, 2, 8, 7, 13, 13\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n}"

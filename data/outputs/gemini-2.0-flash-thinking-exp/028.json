Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **8 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 4 blocks: 2 yellow rectangular blocks and 2 orange cylinder blocks.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 blocks: 2 blue cube blocks.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 2 blocks: 1 red arch block and 1 orange triangular prism block.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Bottom Layer:** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side, forming the base. Two orange cylinder blocks are positioned vertically on top of these yellow blocks, one on each.\n    - **Middle Layer:** Two blue cube blocks are placed on top of the yellow rectangular blocks, adjacent to the orange cylinder blocks and aligned with the base yellow blocks.\n    - **Top Layer:** A red arch block is placed horizontally spanning across the two blue cube blocks. An orange triangular prism block is placed on top of the red arch block, positioned centrally.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal orientation): Index **8** (Needed 2 times)\n    - Orange Cylinder Block (vertical orientation): Index **10** (Needed 2 times)\n    - Blue Cube Block: Index **5** (Needed 2 times)\n    - Red Arch Block: Index **2** (Needed 1 time)\n    - Orange Triangular Prism Block: Index **1** (Needed 1 time)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 8, 8, 10, 10, 5, 5, 2, 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n}"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 13 blocks and has a maximum of 4 layers in the train part and 3 layers in the house part.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two orange cylinder blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side on the left. To their right, two red arch blocks are positioned next to each other, forming an archway.\n    - **Layer 2:** A green rectangular block is placed horizontally atop the two orange cylinders. Another green rectangular block is placed horizontally spanning across the two red arch blocks. A blue cube is placed on top of the left red arch block. A yellow semi-cylinder block is placed on top of the right red arch block.\n    - **Layer 3:** Two blue cubes are stacked vertically on top of the green rectangular block over the cylinders. A red roof block is placed on top of the blue cube on the left arch. A yellow rectangular block is placed vertically on top of the yellow semi-cylinder. An orange roof block is placed on top of the green rectangular block over the arches.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top):** The second blue cube of the train stack forms the top layer of the train section.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Orange Cylinder (horizontal): Block 10 (used twice)\n    - Green Rectangle (horizontal): Block 6 (used twice)\n    - Blue Cube: Block 3 (used three times)\n    - Red Arch: Block 1 (used twice)\n    - Yellow Semi-cylinder: Block 11\n    - Red Roof: Block 15\n    - Yellow Rectangle (vertical): Block 9\n    - Orange Roof: Block 16\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 10, 10, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 6, 11, 15, 9, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 3\"\n}\n```"

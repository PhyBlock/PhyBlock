Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n\n**Left Structure:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** 4 blocks, 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red rectangular blocks placed side-by-side horizontally.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Top):** One green rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the two red blocks, spanning across their width. An orange triangular prism is placed on top of the green block, towards the right side.\n\n**Right Structure:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** 6 blocks, visually appears to be 4 layers high (including the base and frame).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** One green rectangular block placed horizontally.\n    *   **Layer 2:** One orange cylinder placed vertically on top of the green base block.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Walls):** Two yellow rectangular blocks placed vertically, positioned on opposite sides of the orange cylinder.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Frame Top):** Two green rectangular blocks placed horizontally on top of the yellow vertical blocks, forming a frame around the orange cylinder and triangular prism.\n    *   **Layer 5 (Top):** An orange triangular prism placed inside the frame, resting on top of the orange cylinder.\n\n## 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**Blocks for Left Structure:**\n\n*   Red Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index **3** (needed twice)\n*   Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index **4** (needed once)\n*   Orange Triangular Prism: Index **16** (needed once)\n\n**Blocks for Right Structure:**\n\n*   Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Index **4** (needed once for base)\n*   Orange Cylinder (Vertical): Index **12** (needed once)\n*   Yellow Rectangular Block (Vertical): Index **10** (needed twice for walls)\n*   Green Rectangular Block (Vertical): Index **5** (needed twice for frame top)\n*   Orange Triangular Prism: Index **16** (needed once for top)\n\n\n**List of Block Indices (for both structures combined, as used in assembly):** 3, 3, 4, 16, 4, 12, 10, 10, 16, 5, 5\n\n## 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {3}\n    Step2: Move block with index {3}\n    Step3: Move block with index {4}\n    Step4: Move block with index {16}\n    Step5: Move block with index {4}\n    Step6: Move block with index {12}\n    Step7: Move block with index {10}\n    Step8: Move block with index {10}\n    Step9: Move block with index {16}\n    Step10: Move block with index {5}\n    Step11: Move block with index {5}\n}"

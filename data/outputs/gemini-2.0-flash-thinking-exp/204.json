It has 4 layers in the left structure and 4 layers in the right structure at its highest point.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:**\n      - **Left Structure:** The left structure is a tower of blocks. Starting from the bottom, it consists of a red arch, a horizontal green rectangular block placed on top of the arch, a blue cube placed on top of the green block, and a red roof block placed on top of the blue cube.\n      - **Right Structure:** The right structure is more complex. It starts with an orange cylinder at the base. On top of this cylinder, two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side. A second orange cylinder is placed vertically on top of these two yellow blocks. Finally, three orange roof blocks are arranged on top of the second orange cylinder to form a roof-like top.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n   - **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n      - Red Arch: Block index 1 (used once)\n      - Green Horizontal Rectangle: Block index 7 (used once)\n      - Blue Cube: Block index 3 (used once)\n      - Red Roof: Block index 13 (used once as red roof, should be orange roof actually for right side, but for left side, using block 13 as roof is fine - let's assume the roof color in target image is meant to be orange in dictionary based on context)\n      - Orange Cylinder: Block index 10 (used twice)\n      - Yellow Horizontal Rectangle: Block index 8 (used twice)\n      - Orange Roof: Block index 13 (used three times - assuming the red roof in left structure and orange roof in right structure both map to block 13 as it seems to be the only roof block available and color difference might be due to lighting/rendering in target image)\n\n   - **List Block Indices:** 1, 7, 3, 13, 10, 8, 8, 10, 13, 13, 13\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n   ```json\n   {\n      \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n      \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n      \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n      \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n      \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n      \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n      \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n      \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n      \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n      \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n      \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n   }\n   ```"

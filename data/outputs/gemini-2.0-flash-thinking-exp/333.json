Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The main target image displays two separate structures.\n    - **Left Structure:** Composed of 4 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    - **Right Structure:** Composed of 5 blocks and has 4 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Left Structure:**\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red arch block is placed at the base.\n        - **Layer 2 (Middle):** A green rectangular block is placed to the left, adjacent to a blue square block placed to the right. Both blocks are side-by-side and rest on the red arch block below.\n        - **Layer 3 (Top):** Another red arch block is placed on top, spanning across both the green rectangular and blue square blocks from the layer below.\n    - **Right Structure:**\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red arch block is placed at the base.\n        - **Layer 2:** A green rectangular block is placed on top of the red arch block.\n        - **Layer 3:** A blue square block is placed to the left, adjacent to a yellow square block placed to the right. Both blocks are side-by-side and rest on the green rectangular block below.\n        - **Layer 4 (Top):** A red arch block is placed on top, spanning across both the blue square and yellow square blocks from the layer below.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Red Arch Block (for bottom and top layers in both structures): **Block Index 1**\n    - Green Rectangular Block (middle layers): **Block Index 12**\n    - Blue Square Block (middle layers): **Block Index 7**\n    - Yellow Square Block (middle layer of right structure): **Block Index 11**\n\n* **List of Block Indices:**\n    - For Left Structure: Block 1, Block 12, Block 7, Block 1\n    - For Right Structure: Block 1, Block 12, Block 7, Block 11, Block 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n* **Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Assembly Instructions for Left Structure\": {\n        \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n        \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n        \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n        \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n    },\n    \"Assembly Instructions for Right Structure\": {\n        \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n        \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n        \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n        \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n        \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n    }\n}\n```"

Left section: Red arch blocks forming a bridge/tunnel with a green rectangular block on top and a red arch block above that\n2. Middle section: A blue cube with an orange triangular roof, next to yellow cylindrical blocks\n3. Right section: Yellow cube blocks and an orange house with triangular roof, with green rectangular blocks as supports\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, here are the blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch block (index 1) - needed 5 times for the bridge/tunnel structure\n2. Blue cube (index 2) - needed 1 time for the house/building in the middle\n3. Green cube (index 3) - needed 1 time \n4. Orange cube (index 4) - needed 1 time for house base\n5. Green horizontal rectangle (index 5) - needed 1 time\n6. Green horizontal rectangle (index 6) - needed 2 times\n7. Green vertical rectangle (index 7) - needed 2 times\n8. Yellow horizontal rectangle (index 8) - needed 1 time\n9. Yellow vertical rectangle (index 9) - needed 2 times\n10. Yellow horizontal rectangle (index 10) - needed 1 time\n11. Yellow half-cylinder (index 11) - needed 2 times\n12. Yellow half-cylinder (smaller) (index 12) - not needed\n13. Orange cube (index 13) - not needed (already covered by index 4)\n14. Orange triangular roof (index 14) - needed 2 times\n15. Orange triangular roof (index 15) - not needed\n16. Orange triangular roof (index 16) - not needed\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 5\n   Step8: Move block with index 2\n   Step9: Move block with index 14\n   Step10: Move block with index 4\n   Step11: Move block with index 14\n   Step12: Move block with index 9\n   Step13: Move block with index 9\n   Step14: Move block with index 11\n   Step15: Move block with index 11\n   Step16: Move block with index 7\n   Step17: Move block with index 7\n   Step18: Move block with index 3\n   Step19: Move block with index 8\n   Step20: Move block with index 10\n}\n```",

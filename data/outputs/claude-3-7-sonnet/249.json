Left Structure:\n   - 3 blocks total (2 red blocks with a hole and 1 green rectangular block)\n   - 3 layers (red on bottom, green in middle, red on top)\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - 4 blocks total (1 blue cube, 1 yellow rectangular block, and 2 orange cylindrical blocks)\n   - 2 layers (orange cylinders on bottom layer, blue cube and yellow block on top layer)\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n\n1. Left Structure:\n   - Two red blocks with a circular hole through them are stacked vertically\n   - A green rectangular block is placed horizontally between the two red blocks, passing through their holes\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - Two orange cylindrical blocks are placed horizontally and parallel to each other on the ground\n   - A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across the two orange cylinders\n   - A blue cube sits on top of the yellow rectangular block at one end\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\nFor the Left Structure:\n- 2 red blocks with a circular hole: blocks #1 and #1 again (they appear identical)\n- 1 green rectangular block (horizontal orientation): block #8\n\nFor the Right Structure:\n- 2 orange cylindrical blocks (horizontal orientation): blocks #13 and #13 again\n- 1 yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation): block #12\n- 1 blue cube: block #6\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 13\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly starts with the right structure (vehicle-like construction) by placing the two orange cylinders as the base, then the yellow rectangular block across them, followed by the blue cube. Then the left structure is assembled by placing one red block with a hole, inserting the green rectangular block through it, and finally placing the second red block with a hole on top.",

Block #1 - Red arch block (left side of base)\n2. Block #2 - Red arch block (right side of base)\n3. Block #3 - Red rectangular block with cutout (middle support)\n4. Block #12 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (second layer)\n5. Block #5 - Green cube (left side of third layer)\n6. Block #5 - Green cube (right side of third layer) - used twice\n7.

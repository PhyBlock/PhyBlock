A larger structure (on the left) that resembles a small castle or tower:\n   - It has 3 layers in total\n   - Layer 1 (bottom): Two red arch blocks forming a base\n   - Layer 2 (middle): A yellow rectangular block spanning across the arches, with a green cube and blue cube on top\n   - Layer 3 (top): A red arch/tunnel block topped with an orange triangular roof\n\n2. A smaller structure (on the right) that resembles a small bridge or gateway:\n   - It has 2 layers\n   - Layer 1 (bottom): A red arch block\n   - Layer 2 (top): A blue cube and a yellow cube placed side by side\n\n## Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\nFor the larger structure (left):\n- 2 red arch blocks (index 1)\n- 1 yellow rectangular block (index 9 or 10)\n- 1 green cube (index 7)\n- 1 blue cube (index 6)\n- 1 red arch/tunnel block (index 2)\n- 1 orange triangular roof (index 14)\n\nFor the smaller structure (right):\n- 1 red arch block (index 1)\n- 1 blue cube (index 6)\n- 1 yellow cube (index 8)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 2\n   Step7: Move block with index 14\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n   Step10: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first creates the larger structure (steps 1-7) by starting with the base arches, then adding the rectangular block, cubes, top arch, and finally the roof. Then it creates the smaller structure (steps 8-10) by placing the arch and then the two cubes on top.",

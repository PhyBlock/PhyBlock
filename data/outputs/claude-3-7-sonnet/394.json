A smaller structure on the left side with 2 layers\n\nTotal block count appears to be approximately 14 blocks across both structures.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Structure 1 (Right, Larger Structure):\n- Base layer: Contains 4 blocks - a red tunnel block in the center, with a yellow cube on each side, and an orange triangular ramp on the right side\n- Middle layer: Contains a red tunnel block\n- Top layer: Has a house-like formation with a green cube and a blue cube side by side, topped with orange triangular roof pieces\n\n### Structure 2 (Left, Smaller Structure):\n- Base layer: A red tunnel/arch block\n- Top layer: Has orange triangular roof pieces forming a roof shape\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\n- Red tunnel/arch blocks (indices 1 and 3)\n- Yellow cubes (index 8)\n- Orange cubes (index 6) \n- Blue cubes (index 4)\n- Green cubes (index 5)\n- Orange triangular ramp/roof pieces (indices 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)\n- Red cubes (index 7)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 8\n  Step3: Move block with index 8\n  Step4: Move block with index 11\n  Step5: Move block with index 3\n  Step6: Move block with index 5\n  Step7: Move block with index 4\n  Step8: Move block with index 12\n  Step9: Move block with index 15\n  Step10: Move block with index 1\n  Step11: Move block with index 10\n  Step12: Move block with index 10\n  Step13: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order follows a bottom-to-top approach for both structures, starting with the base of the larger structure, then building upward, and finally constructing the smaller structure.",

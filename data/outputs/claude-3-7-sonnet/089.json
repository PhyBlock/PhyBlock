      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n## Structure Description:\nThe target structure resembles a small table or stool with a top platform and a small column on top. It consists of:\n\n- 3 layers in total\n- 8 blocks used in the entire structure\n- Colors: yellow (3 blocks) and orange (5 blocks)\n\n## Layer Analysis:\n1. **Bottom Layer**: Four orange cylindrical blocks arranged in a table/stool leg formation\n2. **Middle Layer**: Two yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally side by side forming a table top\n3. **Top Layer**: One orange cylindrical block standing vertically with a yellow half-cylindrical block on top\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- Four orange cylindrical blocks form the legs of the structure, arranged in a rectangular pattern\n- Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinders, forming the table surface\n- One orange cylindrical block stands vertically on top of the yellow rectangular blocks\n- One yellow half-cylindrical block (curved top) sits on top of the uppermost orange cylinder\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on the structure in the target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Yellow rectangular blocks in horizontal orientation (for the middle layer): Blocks #2 and #2 again\n2. Orange cylindrical blocks in vertical orientation (for the legs and top column): Blocks #7, #7, #7, #7, and #7 again\n3. Yellow half-cylindrical block with curved top (for the topmost piece): Block #10\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 7\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 2\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the four legs, then adding the table top with two rectangular blocks, followed by the vertical column and finally the curved top piece.",

Yellow rectangular blocks (base): Block indices 9 and 10\n2. Red block with semi-circular cutout: Block index 1\n3. Yellow vertical block: Block index 11\n4. Orange triangular/sloped piece: Block index 16\n5. Green horizontal block: Block index 7\n6. Blue cubes: Block index 6 (used twice)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 16\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the foundation blocks and working upward to create a stable structure matching the target image.",

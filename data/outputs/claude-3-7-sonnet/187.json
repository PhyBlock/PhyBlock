For the left structure:\n   - Two green vertical rectangular blocks (indices 2 and 3)\n   - Two yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (indices 5 and 5 or 9 and 9)\n   - One orange triangular block (index 13)\n\n2. For the right structure:\n   - One green horizontal rectangular block (index 4)\n   - Two orange cylindrical blocks (index 10, used twice)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly order starts with the left structure from bottom to top (yellow platform, two green vertical blocks, another yellow platform, and the orange triangular roof), then builds the right structure (two orange cylinders and a green horizontal block on top).",

Bottom layer: A horizontal green rectangular block (flat and wide) serving as the base\n2. Middle layer: An orange cylindrical block standing vertically\n3. Top layer: Three green blocks arranged as follows:\n   - A horizontal green rectangular block connecting the two vertical blocks\n   - Two vertical green rectangular blocks standing side by side on top of the horizontal block\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Block #1: Green horizontal rectangular block (for the base)\n2. Block #7: Orange vertical cylindrical block (for the middle section)\n3. Block #5: Green horizontal rectangular block (for connecting the top vertical blocks)\n4. Block #3: Green vertical rectangular block (for one of the top vertical pieces)\n5. Block #3: Green vertical rectangular block (for the other top vertical piece) - using this block twice\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, starting with the base, adding the cylindrical center, then the horizontal connector, and finally the two vertical blocks on top.",

Left Structure (resembling a small factory or house):\n   - 6 blocks total\n   - 4 layers from bottom to top\n\n2. Right Structure (resembling a bridge or wall):\n   - 6 blocks total\n   - 2 layers from bottom to top\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Left Structure\nFrom bottom to top:\n- Bottom (1st layer): A red bridge-like block with an arch\n- Second layer: A green rectangular horizontal block\n- Third layer: A yellow rectangular horizontal block\n- Top (4th layer): Three orange pieces forming a small house-like structure with a tall cylindrical chimney\n\n### Right Structure\nFrom bottom to top:\n- Bottom (1st layer): A long red bridge-like block with two arches\n- Top (2nd layer): Five green cube/rectangular blocks arranged in a row vertically\n\n# Selection of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\n## Left Structure (from bottom up)\n1. Red bridge block with arch: Block index 1\n2. Green rectangular horizontal block: Block index 6\n3. Yellow rectangular horizontal block: Block index 9\n4. Orange triangular roof pieces: Block indices 14 and 15\n5. Orange cylindrical chimney: Block index 11\n\n## Right Structure (from bottom up)\n1. Red bridge block with two arches: Need to use two blocks with index 2 side by side\n2. Five green vertical blocks: Block index 7 (needs to be used 5 times)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 14\n   Step5: Move block with index 15\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 2\n   Step8: Move block with index 2\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 7\n   Step11: Move block with index 7\n   Step12: Move block with index 7\n   Step13: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the left structure first (steps 1-6), starting from the bottom and working up, then constructs the right structure (steps 7-13), placing the bridge base first and then adding the vertical green blocks on top.",

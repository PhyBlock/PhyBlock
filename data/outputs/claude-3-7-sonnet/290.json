A complex structure on the left with an arch and orange triangular blocks, topped with a green rectangular block\n2. A simpler structure on the right that appears to be a red arch with orange triangular blocks on top\n\nIn total, I count:\n- 2 red arch pieces (one for each structure)\n- 5 orange triangular/sloped blocks (3 in the left structure, 2 in the right)\n- 1 green rectangular block (on top of the left structure)\n\nThe structures have different heights:\n- Left structure: 3 layers (red arch at bottom, orange triangular blocks in middle, green block on top)\n- Right structure: 2 layers (red arch at bottom, orange triangular blocks on top)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\nFor the left structure:\n- Base: Red arch piece (block #2)\n- Middle: Three orange triangular pieces arranged around the top of the arch (blocks #13, #15, and likely #16)\n- Top: Green rectangular block (block #8) placed horizontally on top of the triangular pieces\n\nFor the right structure:\n- Base: Red arch piece (block #1)\n- Top: Two orange triangular pieces arranged to form a roof-like structure (blocks #13 and #15)\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Block #1 - Red arch piece (for the right structure)\n2. Block #2 - Red arch piece (for the left structure)\n3. Block #8 - Green rectangular block in horizontal orientation (for the top of the left structure)\n4. Block #13 - Orange triangular/sloped block (used in both structures)\n5. Block #15 - Orange triangular/sloped block (used in both structures)\n6. Block #16 - Orange triangular/sloped block (used in the left structure)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 13\n   Step4: Move block with index 15\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n   Step6: Move block with index 15\n   Step7: Move block with index 16\n   Step8: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with placing both arch blocks first, then builds the right structure with two orange triangular pieces, followed by completing the left structure with its orange triangular pieces and finally the green block on top.",

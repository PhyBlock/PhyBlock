Base layer: Yellow rectangular platform (block 8)\n  2. Second layer: Red block with circular hole (block 3) and a black attachment on the right side\n  3. Third layer: Yellow rectangular platform (block 8)\n  4. Fourth layer: Three green vertical blocks (blocks 5 or 6) forming pillar-like supports\n  5. Fifth layer: Yellow rectangular platform (block 8)\n  6. Top layer: Orange triangular roof (block 15)\n\n### Bench Structure:\n- Total blocks: 5 blocks\n- Configuration:\n  1. Two red arch blocks (blocks 1 and 2) as legs/supports\n  2. One red rectangular block (connector between arches)\n  3. One yellow rectangular platform (block 7) on top\n  4. One yellow half-cylinder (block 10) on the right end\n\n## Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nFor the tower structure:\n- 3× Yellow horizontal rectangular platforms (block 8)\n- 1× Red block with circular hole (block 3)\n- 3× Green vertical blocks (block 5)\n- 1× Orange triangular block (block 15)\n\nFor the bench structure:\n- 1× Red arch block facing left (block 1)\n- 1× Red arch block facing right (block 2)\n- 1× Red rectangular block\n- 1× Yellow horizontal rectangular platform (block 7)\n- 1× Yellow half-cylinder (block 10)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 2\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n    Step12: Move block with index 7\n    Step13: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nNote: For the horizontal connector between the bench legs, I selected block 6 (green rectangular block) as there doesn't appear to be a red horizontal block in the dictionary that matches exactly. The actual structure appears to have a red connector, but I've selected the closest available block from the dictionary.",

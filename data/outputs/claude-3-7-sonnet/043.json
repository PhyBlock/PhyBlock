Middle Layer: Four red blocks with curved sections that form a circular hole when assembled together\n3. Top Layer: A horizontal yellow rectangular block identical to the bottom one\n\nThe structure resembles a frame with a circular opening in the middle, with yellow \"caps\" on the top and bottom.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks\n\nLooking at the block dictionary, I need:\n\n1. Four red curved blocks to create the circular opening\n2. Two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks for the top and bottom\n\nBased on the orientation in the target image, I need these specific blocks:\n- Block #1: Red curved piece (top-left of circle)\n- Block #2: Red curved piece (top-right of circle)\n- Block #5: Red curved piece (bottom-left of circle)\n- Block #8: Red curved piece (bottom-right of circle)\n- Block #9 or #10: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (two identical blocks needed for top and bottom)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nThe logical assembly order would be to build from bottom to top:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 10\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nI'm using block #10 for the bottom and block #9 for the top yellow piece, though they appear identical and could be interchanged.",

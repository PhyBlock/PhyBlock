The key features are:\n- 5 red blocks with holes/tunnels \n- 2 blue cubic blocks\n- 2 yellow horizontal rectangular blocks\n- 1 yellow vertical rectangular block\n- 1 green horizontal rectangular block\n- 2 orange triangular/wedge blocks\n\nThe structure has 3 main layers:\n1. Bottom layer: Yellow blocks as supports and an orange triangular block\n2. Middle layer: Red tunnel blocks and a green rectangular block\n3. Top layer: Blue cubic blocks and some overlapping elements\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The structure appears to be a train-like or bridge-like formation\n- Four red tunnel blocks are arranged in a row at the structure's core\n- A yellow horizontal block connects the first two red tunnel blocks \n- A green horizontal block connects the right side red tunnel block to the blue blocks\n- Two blue cubic blocks are positioned side by side on the right end\n- Two orange triangular blocks are positioned at the far right, creating a wedge or ramp shape\n- Yellow blocks serve as supports under the red tunnel blocks\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the main target image, I need the following blocks from the block dictionary:\n\n1. Block #1 (Red tunnel block) - needed 4 times\n2. Block #3 (Blue cube) - needed 2 times\n3. Block #6 (Green horizontal rectangle) - needed 1 time\n4. Block #7 or #8 (Yellow horizontal rectangle) - needed 2 times\n5. Block #9 (Yellow vertical rectangle) - needed 1 time\n6. Block #15 (Orange triangular wedge) - needed 2 times\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 3\n    Step11: Move block with index 3\n    Step12: Move block with index 15\n    Step13: Move block with index 15\n}\n```",

There are two identical structures shown in the image - one on the left appears to be a simpler version, and one on the right is the complete structure.\n\nFocusing on the complete structure (right side):\n- The structure has 3 layers in total\n- It uses 7 blocks: 2 green cubes, 2 blue cubes, 2 yellow half-cylinders, and 1 red U-shaped block\n- There's also a yellow rectangular block that serves as a bridge on the second layer\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- Bottom layer: A green cube and blue cube are placed side by side with two yellow half-cylinder blocks in front of them\n- Middle layer: A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across the top of the green and blue cubes\n- Top layer: A red U-shaped block sits on top of the yellow rectangular block\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks:\n- Green cube (index 7)\n- Blue cube (index 6)\n- Yellow half-cylinder (index 13) - used twice\n- Yellow rectangular block (index 9)\n- Red U-shaped block (index 3)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, starting with the foundation cubes, then adding the front half-cylinders, placing the yellow rectangular bridge, and finally positioning the red U-shaped block on top.",

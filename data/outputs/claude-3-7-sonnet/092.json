Two green vertical rectangular blocks (for the legs) - Block index 2 (used twice)\n2. One yellow horizontal rectangular block (for the body) - Block index 7\n3. One orange vertical cylindrical block (for the neck) - Block index 10\n4. One yellow dome/semi-cylindrical block (for the head) - Block index 12\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the two leg blocks, then adding the horizontal body, followed by the neck, and finally placing the dome-shaped head on top.",

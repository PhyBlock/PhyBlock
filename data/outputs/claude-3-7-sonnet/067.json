Red arch base: Block with index 1\n2. Yellow semi-cylindrical blocks (2 of them): Blocks with index 6 and 7\n3. Orange triangular roof: Block with index 14\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 6\n  Step3: Move block with index 7\n  Step4: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThis assembly order follows the logical bottom-to-top construction process, starting with the foundation (red arch), adding the middle layer of yellow semi-cylindrical blocks, and finishing with the triangular roof piece.",

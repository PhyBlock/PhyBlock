It consists of multiple building blocks arranged in layers.\n\n### Count & Layers:\n- The structure has 3 distinct layers\n- There are 8 blocks used in the main structure\n- Additionally, there are 4 blocks shown separately to the right of the main structure\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n1. Bottom layer: Four orange cylindrical blocks (legs) arranged in a rectangular formation\n2. Middle layer: Two yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinders\n3. Top layer: One green vertical rectangular block with a yellow semi-cylindrical block on top\n\n4. Separate structure: A blue cube, a green cube, and two yellow semi-cylindrical blocks arranged side by side\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nFor the main structure:\n- 4× Orange cylindrical blocks (index 13)\n- 2× Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (index 10)\n- 1× Green vertical rectangular block (index 7)\n- 1× Yellow semi-cylindrical block (index 15)\n\nFor the separate structure:\n- 1× Blue cube (index 1)\n- 1× Green cube (index 2)\n- 2× Yellow semi-cylindrical blocks (index 15)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 15\n    Step12: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly begins with the four orange cylindrical legs, followed by the yellow rectangular platform pieces, then the green vertical block and yellow semi-cylindrical top. After completing the main structure, the separate arrangement is assembled with the green cube, blue cube, and two yellow semi-cylindrical blocks.",

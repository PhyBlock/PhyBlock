A main train body consisting of:\n   - Red arched base pieces (forming a train undercarriage)\n   - Blue cube with orange triangular roof (front cabin)\n   - Orange cube with orange triangular roof (rear cabin)\n   - Yellow semi-cylindrical blocks (middle section/boiler)\n   - Yellow rectangular blocks standing vertically (smokestacks)\n   - Green blocks for details\n\n2. A ramp/slide section:\n   - Orange ramp connecting to the train\n\n3. A tunnel structure:\n   - Red hollow rectangular blocks forming a tunnel\n   - Green horizontal bar crossing through the tunnel\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Block #1 - Red arch piece (used multiple times for train base)\n2. Block #2 - Red curved piece (appears to be part of the train)\n3. Block #3 - Red arch piece (used for the tunnel)\n4. Block #4 - Blue cube (for the front cabin)\n5. Block #5 - Green cube (for details)\n6. Block #6 - Orange cube (for the rear cabin)\n7. Block #7 - Green horizontal bar (for the tunnel crosspiece)\n8. Block #8 - Green vertical piece (for details)\n9. Block #9 - Yellow horizontal piece (for details)\n10. Block #10 - Yellow vertical piece (for smokestacks)\n11. Block #11 - Yellow semi-cylindrical piece (for the train boiler)\n12. Block #12 - Yellow small vertical piece (for details)\n14. Block #14 - Orange triangular roof (for cabin roofs)\n15. Block #15 - Orange triangular piece (for details)\n16. Block #16 - Orange ramp piece (for the slide)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 14\n   Step7: Move block with index 11\n   Step8: Move block with index 11\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n   Step10: Move block with index 14\n   Step11: Move block with index 5\n   Step12: Move block with index 8\n   Step13: Move block with index 10\n   Step14: Move block with index 10\n   Step15: Move block with index 16\n   Step16: Move block with index 3\n   Step17: Move block with index 7\n   Step18: Move block with index 3\n}\n```",

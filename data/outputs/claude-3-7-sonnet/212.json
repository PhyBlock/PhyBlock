Bottom layer: Two yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (foundations)\n  2. Second layer: Red block with a circular hole/tunnel through it\n  3. Third layer: Another yellow horizontal rectangular block\n  4. Fourth layer: A red cube on the right and a blue cube on the left, side by side\n  5. Top layer: A green horizontal rectangular block with two orange triangular roof pieces\n\n## Structure 2 (Smaller house on the left):\n- This is a simpler structure with 3 main components:\n  1. Base: Green vertical rectangular blocks\n  2. Middle: An orange cylindrical block appears to be placed between green blocks\n  3. Top: Orange triangular roof pieces\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nFor Structure 1 (Tower):\n- Yellow horizontal blocks (index 10) x 3\n- Red block with circular hole (indices 1, 2, 3, or 4) - appears to be index 2\n- Red cube (index 7) x 1\n- Blue cube (index 5) x 1\n- Green horizontal rectangular block (index 8) x 1\n- Orange triangular roof pieces (indices 13, 14, 15, or 16) - appear to be indices 13 and 14\n\nFor Structure 2 (House):\n- Green vertical rectangular blocks (index 9) x 2\n- Orange cylindrical block (index 12) x 1\n- Orange triangular roof pieces (indices 13, 14, 15, or 16) - appears to be indices 15 and 16\n\n# Assembly Instructions\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 10\n  Step2: Move block with index 10\n  Step3: Move block with index 2\n  Step4: Move block with index 10\n  Step5: Move block with index 7\n  Step6: Move block with index 5\n  Step7: Move block with index 8\n  Step8: Move block with index 13\n  Step9: Move block with index 14\n  Step10: Move block with index 9\n  Step11: Move block with index 9\n  Step12: Move block with index 12\n  Step13: Move block with index 15\n  Step14: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly order follows a bottom-to-top approach for both structures, starting with the larger tower structure and then proceeding to the smaller house structure.",

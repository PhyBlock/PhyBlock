      "text": "## Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure appears to be a small house-like construction with the following components:\n\n- The structure has 2 distinct layers\n- Bottom layer: A red archway block with orange triangular/wedge shapes on both sides\n- Top layer: A cube structure with a blue cube on one side, a green cube on the other side, and orange triangular/wedge shapes forming a roof on top\n\nTotal block count: 6 blocks arranged in a specific structure with clear spatial relationships.\n\n## Detailed Block Identification and Spatial Relationships\n\n1. Base layer:\n   - A red arch block (with a semicircular opening) in the center\n   - Two orange triangular/wedge blocks on either side of the red arch\n\n2. Upper layer: \n   - A blue cube on the right side\n   - A green cube on the left side\n   - An orange triangular/wedge block on top forming a roof\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the main target image, I need the following blocks from the block dictionary:\n\n1. Block index 1: Red arch block (for the center of the bottom layer)\n2. Block index 5: Blue cube (for the right side of the upper layer)\n3. Block index 6: Green cube (for the left side of the upper layer)\n4. Block index 14: Orange triangular/wedge block (for the left side of the bottom layer)\n5. Block index 16: Orange triangular/wedge block (for the right side of the bottom layer)\n6. Block index 15: Orange triangular/wedge block (for the top of the structure/roof)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nThe logical assembly order would be to build from the bottom up:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 14\n   Step3: Move block with index 16\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the red archway base, adds the two orange wedges on either side, then places the blue and green cubes on top, and finally adds the orange wedge on top to complete the roof.",

Bottom layer: Two yellow rectangular bases with two orange cylindrical pillars\n2. Middle-lower layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block\n3. Middle-upper layer: Two blue cube blocks side by side\n4. Top layer: A red house-like structure with an orange triangular roof\n\nTotal block count: 8 blocks in the main structure, plus what appears to be a separate blue cube with orange triangular pieces in the lower right of the image.\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The foundation consists of a yellow rectangular platform (bottom layer) with two orange cylindrical pillars standing vertically on it\n- Above the pillars is another yellow rectangular platform (same size as the bottom one)\n- On top of the second yellow platform are two blue cubes placed side by side\n- The red house structure with an arched doorway sits on top of the blue cubes\n- The orange triangular roof sits on top of the red house structure\n- In the lower right corner of the image, there appears to be a separate structure with a blue cube and orange triangular pieces\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Two yellow rectangular blocks horizontally oriented (index 6)\n2. Two orange cylindrical pillars (index 9)\n3. Two blue cube blocks (index 4)\n4. One red house-like structure with an arched doorway (index 1)\n5. One orange triangular roof piece (index 13)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, creating a stable foundation first, then adding the middle platform, the blue cubes, the house structure, and finally the triangular roof.",

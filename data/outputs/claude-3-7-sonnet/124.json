Red arch block with opening on one side (Index 1)\n2. Red arch block with opening on one side (Index 2)\n3. Yellow rectangular block (Index 10)\n4. Yellow semi-cylindrical block (Index 11)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence places the two red arch blocks first to create the base, then adds the yellow rectangular block across them, and finally places the yellow semi-cylindrical block on top of the rectangular block to complete the structure.",

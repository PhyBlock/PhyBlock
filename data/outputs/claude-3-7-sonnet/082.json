For the base layer:\n   - Block #1 (Red archway/tunnel block)\n   - Block #2 (Red curved block) for one side of the tunnel\n   - Block #3 (Red curved block) for the other side of the tunnel\n   - Block #13 (Orange triangular support) for the left side\n   - Block #15 (Orange triangular support) for the right side\n\n2. For the middle layer:\n   - Block #6 (Yellow half-cylinder) for one side\n   - Block #7 (Yellow half-cylinder) for the other side\n\n3. For the top layer:\n   - Block #12 (Orange triangular roof piece)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the central tunnel piece, adding the side pieces of the tunnel, then the triangular supports, followed by the yellow cylindrical pieces on top, and finally placing the triangular roof.",

Green cubic blocks (for the tower): Block index 2\n2. Orange triangular/wedge blocks (for the roof and sides): Block indices 10, 12, 13, 14\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 13\nStep4: Move block with index 14\nStep5: Move block with index 10\nStep6: Move block with index 12\n}\n\nThis assembly order begins with the central green tower (bottom to top), then adds the triangular orange blocks around the base, and finishes with the roof on top.",

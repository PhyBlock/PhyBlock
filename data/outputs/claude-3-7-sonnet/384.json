The construction has approximately 17 blocks arranged in multiple layers.\n\n### Count & Layers:\n- Total blocks: 17\n- Layers: Primarily 2-3 layers in different sections\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\nThe structure has three main sections:\n1. **Left Section (Train/Vehicle Front)**: Contains red arch blocks as the base with blue, yellow, green, and orange blocks stacked on top.\n2. **Middle Section**: Connects the front to the back with red arches and a yellow horizontal bridge.\n3. **Right Section (House)**: A red house-like structure with triangular roof pieces and an arched entrance.\n\n## Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Red arch blocks (index 1, 2) - Used as the base structure, appears 6 times\n2. Red half-cylindrical blocks (index 3) - Used at the front left\n3. Blue cube (index 6) - Used at the top left section\n4. Orange cube (index 7) - Used in the middle section\n5. Green vertical block (index 8) - Used twice in the structure\n6. Yellow horizontal blocks (index 9, 10, 13) - Used as bridges and platforms\n7. Yellow vertical blocks (index 11, 12) - Used as vertical supports\n8. Yellow half-cylinder (index 14) - Used in the front section\n9. Orange triangular roof pieces (index 15, 16) - Used for the house roof\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 2\n  Step3: Move block with index 1\n  Step4: Move block with index 2\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n  Step6: Move block with index 2\n  Step7: Move block with index 13\n  Step8: Move block with index 3\n  Step9: Move block with index 14\n  Step10: Move block with index 6\n  Step11: Move block with index 7\n  Step12: Move block with index 8\n  Step13: Move block with index 11\n  Step14: Move block with index 12\n  Step15: Move block with index 8\n  Step16: Move block with index 15\n  Step17: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the base structure of red arch blocks, then adds the connecting beams, followed by the upper blocks, and finally the roof pieces of the house structure.",

A left section with orange cylindrical pillars supporting green rectangular blocks on top\n2. A right section with green vertical pillars framed by yellow horizontal blocks\n\nTotal blocks: 14 blocks\n- 4 green rectangular blocks on top of the orange pillars\n- 8 orange cylindrical pillars\n- 2 green vertical rectangular pillars on the right\n- 3 yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (top, bottom, and connecting piece)\n\nLayers: 2 layers in both sections\n- Bottom layer: orange cylinders on the left, green pillars and bottom yellow block on the right\n- Top layer: green blocks on the left, top yellow block on the right\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- Left section: 8 orange cylindrical pillars arranged in 2 rows of 4, supporting 4 green rectangular blocks on top\n- Right section: 2 vertical green rectangular pillars with yellow horizontal blocks on top and bottom, and a yellow connecting piece between them\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on the block dictionary, I need the following blocks:\n\nFor the green rectangular blocks on top of the orange pillars:\n- Block index 2 (horizontal green rectangle) - need 4 of these\n\nFor the orange cylindrical pillars:\n- Block index 13 (vertical orange cylinder) - need 8 of these\n\nFor the green vertical pillars on the right:\n- Block index 3 (vertical green rectangle) - need 2 of these\n\nFor the yellow horizontal blocks:\n- Block index 7 (horizontal yellow rectangle) - need 3 of these\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 13\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 13\n   Step4: Move block with index 13\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n   Step6: Move block with index 13\n   Step7: Move block with index 13\n   Step8: Move block with index 13\n   Step9: Move block with index 2\n   Step10: Move block with index 2\n   Step11: Move block with index 2\n   Step12: Move block with index 2\n   Step13: Move block with index 7\n   Step14: Move block with index 3\n   Step15: Move block with index 3\n   Step16: Move block with index 7\n   Step17: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the base of orange cylinders, then adds the green blocks on top. Next, it creates the right structure by placing the bottom yellow block, then the two green vertical pillars, followed by the top yellow block and the connecting yellow block.",

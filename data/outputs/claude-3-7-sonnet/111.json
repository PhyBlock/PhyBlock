This red piece forms the base of the structure.\n2. **Top Layer**: A blue cube placed on top of the red base, specifically positioned on one of the semi-circular cutouts of the base.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The red base block is oriented horizontally with two semi-circular cutouts facing upward\n- The blue cube sits directly on top of the middle section of the red base (on one of the cutouts)\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n1. A red piece with two cutouts (appears to match block #3)\n2. A blue cube (appears to match block #9)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly process involves first placing the red base block (#3) and then positioning the blue cube (#9) on top of one of the semi-circular cutouts of the base.",

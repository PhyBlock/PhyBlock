For the top red block: Block with index 1 - This is a red block with a semi-circular cutout facing the appropriate direction\n2. For the middle green bar: Block with index 10 - This is a green horizontal rectangular bar\n3. For the bottom red block: Block with index 2 - This is a red block with a semi-circular cutout facing upward\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n}\n\nThis assembly order places the bottom red block first, then places the green horizontal bar through its cutout, and finally adds the top red block to complete the structure.",

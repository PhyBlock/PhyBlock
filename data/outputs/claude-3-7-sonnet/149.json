A tall central tower made of two stacked orange cylinders with a triangular roof\n2. A shorter tower to the right made of one orange cylinder with a triangular roof\n3. A cross-like yellow platform in the middle connecting the towers\n4. A third tower element on the left with an orange cylinder and triangular roof\n\n# Selection of Required Blocks\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Yellow rectangular blocks:\n   - Block index 2 (horizontal yellow rectangle)\n   - Block index 4 (horizontal yellow rectangle, oriented differently)\n\n2. Orange cylindrical pillars:\n   - Block index 6 (vertical orange cylinder) - needed 4 times\n\n3. Orange triangular roof pieces:\n   - Block index 13 (orange triangular roof) - needed 3 times\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 13\n   Step8: Move block with index 13\n   Step9: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence would create the structure starting with the main vertical pillars, then adding the horizontal yellow connecting pieces, followed by the shorter pillar on the right, and finally placing the triangular roof pieces on top of each pillar.",

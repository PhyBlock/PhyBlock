An orange triangular roof/wedge block placed on top of the arch\n\nThe structure has 2 layers:\n- Bottom layer: Red arch block\n- Top layer: Orange triangular roof block\n\nThe red arch block has a semicircular opening on one side, and the orange triangular block is positioned on top with its angled side visible.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nLooking at the block dictionary, I need to identify the exact matches for the two blocks in the target structure:\n\n1. For the red arch base: Block with index 1\n   - This is a red arch-shaped block with the arch opening facing forward, exactly as shown in the main image\n\n2. For the orange triangular roof: Block with index 13\n   - This is an orange triangular/wedge block in the correct orientation, matching the one shown on top of the arch in the main image\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on the structure, we need to place the base first, followed by the roof:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence will correctly reproduce the structure shown in the main target image.",

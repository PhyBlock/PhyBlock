Bottom layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically\n2. Middle layer: One yellow horizontal rectangular block connecting the two cylindrical blocks\n3. Upper middle layer: One orange cylindrical block standing vertically on top of the left cylindrical block\n4. Top layer: One more orange cylindrical block continuing upward\n5. Very top: One orange triangular roof-like block\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n- 2 orange vertical cylindrical blocks for the bottom (Block index 4)\n- 1 horizontal yellow rectangular block (Block index 3)\n- 2 more orange vertical cylindrical blocks for the upper portions (Block index 4)\n- 1 orange triangular roof block (Block index 11)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly begins with placing the two cylindrical base columns, then connecting them with the horizontal yellow block, followed by stacking two more cylindrical blocks on the left column, and finally placing the triangular roof piece on top.",

Bottom layer: 4 yellow rectangular blocks and 4 orange cylindrical pillars\n2. Middle layer: 4 yellow rectangular blocks arranged as a platform\n3. Top layer: 1 red house-like structure with an orange roof (composed of triangular pieces)\n\nTotal blocks used: Approximately 13-14 blocks in the entire structure.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The base consists of 4 yellow rectangular blocks arranged in pairs, creating two parallel platforms\n- 4 orange cylindrical pillars stand vertically between these yellow platforms\n- The middle layer has 4 more yellow rectangular blocks creating a square platform on top of the pillars\n- The top layer features a red house-like structure with an arched doorway and an orange triangular roof\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\n- Yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal orientation): #6, #8, #9 (used multiple times)\n- Orange cylindrical pillars (vertical orientation): #10 (used 4 times)\n- Red house structure with arched entrance: #1\n- Orange triangular roof pieces: #13, #14, #15, #16 (forming the roof)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 9\n    Step12: Move block with index 9\n    Step13: Move block with index 1\n    Step14: Move block with index 13\n    Step15: Move block with index 14\n    Step16: Move block with index 15\n    Step17: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the base yellow platforms, adding the pillars, then the middle platform, and finally the house structure with its roof.",

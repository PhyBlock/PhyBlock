Block #1: Red arch block (for the left side of the base)\n2. Block #2: Red arch block (for the right side of the base)\n3. Block #11: Orange triangular/sloped block (for left side of roof)\n4. Block #11: Orange triangular/sloped block (for middle of roof)\n5. Block #11: Orange triangular/sloped block (for right side of roof)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly begins with placing the base blocks (the red arch pieces) side by side, followed by positioning the three identical orange triangular blocks on top to form the roof structure.",

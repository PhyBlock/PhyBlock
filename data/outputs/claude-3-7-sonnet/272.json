Left Structure (Red and Yellow Tower):\n   - Total blocks: 5 blocks\n   - Layers: 3 layers\n   - Colors: Red and yellow\n\n2. Right Structure (Orange and Blue House):\n   - Total blocks: a collection of 7 blocks\n   - Various shapes in orange and blue colors\n\n## Spatial Relationships Description\n\n### Left Structure (Red and Yellow Tower):\n- Base layer: A red block with two arched openings (tunnel-like)\n- Middle layer: A yellow rectangular block placed horizontally across the red base\n- Top layer: A red block with a circular hole topped with a yellow rectangular block\n\n### Right Structure (Orange and Blue House):\n- Central element: A tall orange cylindrical block topped with an orange triangular roof piece\n- Surrounding elements: Two blue rectangular blocks on either side of the cylinder\n- Additional orange triangular/wedge blocks on the sides\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\n## For Left Structure (Red and Yellow Tower):\n- Base: Block index 3 (red block with two arches)\n- Middle: Block index 7 (yellow rectangular block)\n- Top layer red: Block index 5 (red block with circular hole)\n- Top yellow: Block index 7 (yellow rectangular block)\n\n## For Right Structure (Orange and Blue House):\n- Center cylinder: Block index 8 (orange cylindrical block)\n- Roof: Block index 12 (orange triangular block)\n- Blue blocks: Block index 6 (blue rectangular block) - used twice\n- Side wedges: Block indices 14, 15, and 16 (orange triangular/wedge blocks)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 6\n   Step9: Move block with index 14\n   Step10: Move block with index 15\n   Step11: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the left tower first (steps 1-4) and then constructs the right house structure (steps 5-11).",

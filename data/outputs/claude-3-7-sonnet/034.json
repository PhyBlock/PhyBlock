Yellow horizontal blocks (2 needed): Block index 7 or 8 (appear identical in orientation)\n2. Green vertical blocks (2 needed): Block index 3 or 4 (appear identical in orientation)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nI'll start with the bottom yellow block as the foundation, then add the green vertical blocks, and finally place the top yellow block:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order creates a stable structure by first establishing the base, then adding the vertical supports, and finally capping it with the top horizontal block.",

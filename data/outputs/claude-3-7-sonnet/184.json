An orange triangular wedge (15 or 16) is positioned to the left of this stack.\n- In the middle: An orange vertical cylinder (9) supports a red block with two yellow dome-shaped roofs (4 with two #12 pieces on top).\n- On the right side: A red curved track piece (2) with a blue cube (5) on it, followed by another curved piece (3), ending with a vertical red piece (1).\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks (by index number):\n1. Red arch piece (right end)\n2. Red U-shaped curve (left side)\n3. Red U-shaped curve (right side)\n4. Red C-shaped block (for the top structure)\n5. Blue cube (appears twice in the structure)\n6. Green cube (not needed)\n7. Yellow cube\n8. Green rectangular block\n9. Orange vertical cylinder\n10. Orange horizontal cylinder (not needed)\n11. Orange horizontal cylinder (not needed)\n12. Yellow dome/roof piece (appears twice)\n13. Yellow cylinder (not needed)\n14. Orange triangular wedge (not used in this orientation)\n15. Orange triangular wedge (appears once)\n16. Orange triangular wedge (not used in this orientation)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 5\n    Step11: Move block with index 3\n    Step12: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly starts with the base layer, then builds up the supporting elements, followed by the top structures, and finally the track pieces on the right side.",

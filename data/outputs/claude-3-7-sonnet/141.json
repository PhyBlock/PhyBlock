      "text": "## Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure consists of multiple blocks arranged in a tower-like formation with 4 distinct layers:\n\n1. Bottom Layer: Red blocks forming a base with a semi-circular cutout\n2. Second Layer: A green rectangular block\n3. Third Layer: A yellow rectangular block\n4. Top Layer: Several orange blocks including a tall cylindrical block and triangular shapes\n\nTotal block count: 8 blocks\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The bottom layer has red blocks with a semicircular cutout\n- The green rectangular block sits directly on top of the red base\n- The yellow rectangular block is positioned on top of the green block\n- On top of the yellow block are several orange components:\n  - A tall cylindrical block in the center\n  - Triangular blocks on the sides\n  - A rectangular component forming part of the structure\n\n## Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Block #1: Red block with semicircular cutout (bottom layer, left side)\n2. Block #3: Red block with semicircular cutout (bottom layer, right side)\n3. Block #4: Green rectangular block (second layer)\n4. Block #6: Yellow rectangular block (third layer)\n5. Block #7: Orange cylindrical block (top layer, center)\n6. Block #12: Orange triangular block (top layer, right side)\n7. Block #13: Orange triangular block (top layer, left side)\n8. Block #11: Orange rectangular block (top layer, back)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the red base blocks, then adding the green and yellow layers, followed by the orange components, with the tall cylindrical block placed last for stability.",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe structure in the main target image consists of multiple blocks arranged in a complex formation resembling a small tower or structure. Let me analyze it in detail.\n\n## Count & Layers\nThe structure has 3 distinct layers:\n- Bottom layer: 4 orange cylindrical pillars\n- Middle layer: 1 horizontal yellow rectangular block serving as a platform\n- Top layer: 1 orange cylindrical block, 1 blue cube, 2 orange triangular blocks, and 1 yellow half-cylindrical roof piece\n\nTotal number of blocks: 9 blocks\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- Bottom layer: 4 orange cylindrical pillars arranged in a square formation\n- Middle layer: A yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the 4 pillars\n- Top layer arrangement (from bottom to top and left to right):\n  * An orange cylindrical block standing vertically on the left side of the yellow platform\n  * A blue cube placed next to the orange cylinder\n  * Two orange triangular blocks arranged to form a roof-like structure above the blue cube\n  * A yellow half-cylinder placed on top of the orange cylinder as a roof piece\n\n# Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, here are the blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\n1. Block #8 (orange cylinder) - needed 5 times (4 for the base pillars, 1 for the top)\n2. Block #4 (yellow horizontal rectangle) - needed 1 time for the platform\n3. Block #1 (blue cube) - needed 1 time\n4. Block #15 (orange triangular piece) - needed 1 time\n5. Block #16 (orange triangular piece) - needed 1 time\n6. Block #10 (yellow half-cylinder) - needed 1 time for the roof\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 8\n  Step2: Move block with index 8\n  Step3: Move block with index 8\n  Step4: Move block with index 8\n  Step5: Move block with index 4\n  Step6: Move block with index 8\n  Step7: Move block with index 1\n  Step8: Move block with index 15\n  Step9: Move block with index 16\n  Step10: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the four pillars at the base, then adding the platform, followed by the vertical elements on top, and finally capping it with the roof pieces.",

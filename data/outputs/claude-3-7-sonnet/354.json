Left Structure (Tower):\n   - Contains 3 orange cylindrical blocks (including one with a triangular top)\n   - 1 red arch block\n   - 1 blue cube\n   - 2 yellow rectangular blocks\n   - Has multiple layers with a vertical arrangement\n\n2. Right Structure (Bridge/Gateway):\n   - Contains 4 red arch blocks\n   - 3 yellow rectangular blocks\n   - Forms a bridge-like structure with arches\n\nTotal count: 14 blocks across both structures.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Left Structure (Tower):\n- Base: Orange cylindrical block (vertical orientation)\n- Middle: Another orange cylindrical block stacked on top of the first\n- Top: Orange cylindrical block with a triangular top piece\n- At the middle section, there is a red arch block with a tunnel/hole\n- A blue cube sits on top of one side of the arch\n- Two yellow rectangular blocks support the blue cube and connect to the red arch\n\n### Right Structure (Bridge/Gateway):\n- Four red arch blocks arranged in a 2Ã—2 grid formation\n- Three yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally across the top of the arches, connecting them\n- Forms a structure with two tunnels/passages\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the main target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. For the Left Structure (Tower):\n   - Block 11: Orange vertical cylinder (2 times)\n   - Block 15: Orange triangular top piece\n   - Block 1: Red arch block\n   - Block 5: Blue cube\n   - Block 7: Yellow cube\n   - Block 8: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n\n2. For the Right Structure (Bridge/Gateway):\n   - Block 1: Red arch block (2 times)\n   - Block 2: Red arch block (2 times)\n   - Block 8: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal) (2 times)\n   - Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 11\n   Step2: Move block with index 11\n   Step3: Move block with index 15\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 5\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 2\n   Step10: Move block with index 1\n   Step11: Move block with index 2\n   Step12: Move block with index 10\n   Step13: Move block with index 8\n   Step14: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the tower structure from bottom to top, then constructs the bridge/gateway structure from bottom to top as well, completing with the horizontal yellow connecting blocks.",

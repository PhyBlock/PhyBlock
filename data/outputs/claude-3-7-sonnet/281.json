      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure consists of two connected building elements that appear to be a kind of castle or bridge structure. I'll analyze each part in detail.\n\n## Count & Layers:\nThe structure has multiple layers and approximately 25-30 blocks total. It consists of:\n- A bridge/base section with arches (made of red blocks)\n- A left tower structure with triangular roof elements\n- A right tower/gate structure with green columns and a yellow crossbeam\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n1. **Base/Bridge Section**: A row of red arch blocks forms the foundation\n2. **Left Tower**: Built on the left side of the bridge, featuring:\n   - Red arch blocks at base\n   - Yellow squares and red components forming middle section\n   - Blue and green cubic blocks forming upper structure\n   - Orange triangular roof pieces\n   \n3. **Right Tower**: Built on the right side of the bridge, featuring:\n   - Red arch blocks at base\n   - Green horizontal block connecting to bridge\n   - Green vertical columns\n   - Yellow horizontal beam at top\n   - Orange triangular roof piece\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I've identified the following blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\n- Block 1: Red arch block (used multiple times for bridge base)\n- Block 2: Red curved block (used for arches)\n- Block 3: Red semi-circular cutout block (used in structure)\n- Block 4: Blue cube (used in left tower)\n- Block 5: Green cube (used in left tower and right structure)\n- Block 6: Red cube (used in structure)\n- Block 7: Yellow cube (used in left tower)\n- Block 8: Green horizontal rectangle (used to connect towers)\n- Block 9: Green flat rectangle (used in structure)\n- Block 10: Green vertical rectangle (used as columns in right structure)\n- Block 11: Yellow horizontal rectangle (used as top beam in right structure)\n- Block 12: Yellow vertical rectangle (possibly used in structure)\n- Block 13, 14, 15, 16: Orange triangular roof pieces (used for roofing elements)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 3\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 3\n   Step8: Move block with index 7\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 6\n   Step11: Move block with index 5\n   Step12: Move block with index 4\n   Step13: Move block with index 14\n   Step14: Move block with index 13\n   Step15: Move block with index 8\n   Step16: Move block with index 3\n   Step17: Move block with index 3\n   Step18: Move block with index 6\n   Step19: Move block with index 5\n   Step20: Move block with index 10\n   Step21: Move block with index 10\n   Step22: Move block with index 11\n   Step23: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the bridge base, then constructing the left tower, followed by the right tower structure.",

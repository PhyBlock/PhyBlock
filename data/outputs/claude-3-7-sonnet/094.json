Block #5 - Vertical orange cylinder (used 5 times: 4 for base pillars, 1 for top pillar)\n2. Block #3 - Horizontal yellow rectangular block (used 2 times for the platform)\n3. Block #8 - Yellow semi-cylindrical curved block (used 1 time for the top)\n4. Block #15 - Orange triangular block (used 1 time for the right side on top)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 5\n  Step2: Move block with index 5\n  Step3: Move block with index 5\n  Step4: Move block with index 5\n  Step5: Move block with index 3\n  Step6: Move block with index 3\n  Step7: Move block with index 5\n  Step8: Move block with index 15\n  Step9: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from bottom to top: first the four base pillars, then the two yellow rectangular blocks to form the platform, followed by the top orange cylinder, the orange triangular block on the right side, and finally the yellow curved block on the very top.",

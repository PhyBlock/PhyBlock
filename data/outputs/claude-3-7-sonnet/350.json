Red arch blocks (indexes 1, 2, 3)\n2. Blue cubic blocks (index 6)\n3. Green vertical rectangular block (index 7)\n4. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 8)\n5. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (indexes 9, 10)\n6. Yellow vertical rectangular block (index 11)\n7. Orange cylindrical blocks (index 12)\n8. Orange triangular roof blocks (indexes 14, 15)\n9. Red house structure (combination of blocks)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 10\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 14\n   Step10: Move block with index 3\n   Step11: Move block with index 12\n   Step12: Move block with index 12\n   Step13: Move block with index 11\n   Step14: Move block with index 7\n   Step15: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the tower structure from the bottom up, then builds the bridge/arch structure. Note that I've used the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary without rotation.",

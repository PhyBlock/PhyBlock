A tower-like structure with 4 layers:\n   - Bottom layer: Yellow rectangular block\n   - Second layer: Red block with a circular hole\n   - Third layer: Yellow rectangular block with two green vertical blocks on top\n   - Fourth layer: Yellow rectangular block with an orange triangular block on top\n\n2. A small vehicle-like structure with 3 layers:\n   - Bottom layer: Two yellow half-cylinder blocks (wheels)\n   - Middle layer: Yellow rectangular block\n   - Top layer: Orange triangular block\n\n## Spatial Relationships\nFor the tower structure:\n- The yellow blocks form the base of each layer\n- The red block with a hole is positioned between two yellow blocks\n- The two green vertical blocks stand side by side on the middle yellow block\n- The top yellow block rests on the green blocks\n- The orange triangular block sits on the top yellow block\n\nFor the vehicle structure:\n- Two yellow half-cylinders serve as wheels at the bottom\n- A yellow rectangular block sits horizontally on top of the wheels\n- An orange triangular block sits on the rectangular block\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nFor the tower structure:\n- Yellow rectangular blocks (index 9, index 11) - used 3 times\n- Red block with circular hole (appears to need blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4 combined, but using single blocks 3 would work)\n- Green vertical blocks (index 7 and index 8) - used 2 times\n- Orange triangular block (index 15)\n\nFor the vehicle structure:\n- Yellow half-cylinders (index 12) - used 2 times\n- Yellow rectangular block (index 9)\n- Orange triangular block (index 15)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\nFor the tower structure:\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n   Step7: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nFor the vehicle structure:\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 12\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nCombined assembly order (if building both structures):\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n   Step7: Move block with index 15\n   Step8: Move block with index 12\n   Step9: Move block with index 12\n   Step10: Move block with index 9\n   Step11: Move block with index 15\n}\n```",

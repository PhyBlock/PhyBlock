Cube blocks: Blue (#5), Green (#6), Yellow (#7), Orange (#13)\n2. Rectangular blocks: Yellow horizontal (#8)\n3. Cylindrical pillars: Orange vertical (#9)\n4. Triangular roof pieces: Orange in various orientations (#14, #15, #16)\n5. Tunnel/arch piece: Red arch with hole (#2)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8  // Bottom yellow rectangular base for archway\n    Step2: Move block with index 9  // First orange pillar\n    Step3: Move block with index 9  // Second orange pillar\n    Step4: Move block with index 8  // Top yellow rectangular beam for archway\n    Step5: Move block with index 15  // Orange triangular piece on top of archway\n    Step6: Move block with index 2  // Red arch piece with hole for tower base\n    Step7: Move block with index 7  // Yellow cube for left corner of tower base\n    Step8: Move block with index 7  // Yellow cube for right corner of tower base\n    Step9: Move block with index 16  // Orange triangular piece for right side of tower base\n    Step10: Move block with index 14  // Orange triangular piece for left side of tower base\n    Step11: Move block with index 6  // Green cube for second layer left side\n    Step12: Move block with index 5  // Blue cube for second layer right side\n    Step13: Move block with index 15  // Orange triangular piece for left roof\n    Step14: Move block with index 16  // Orange triangular piece for right roof\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the archway on the right, then building the tower/house structure on the left.",

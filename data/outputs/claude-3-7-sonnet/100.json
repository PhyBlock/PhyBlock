It consists of:\n\n- 3 layers total\n- 4 distinct blocks used in the structure\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- Bottom layer: A vertical green rectangular block serving as the post/support\n- Middle layer: A horizontal yellow rectangular block serving as the base/platform\n- Top layer: A red arch-shaped block with an opening (like a doorway) topped with an orange triangular roof piece\n\n## Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nLooking at the block dictionary image, I need to identify the exact matches for each component:\n\n1. Green vertical support: Block #4 (vertical green rectangular block)\n2. Yellow horizontal platform: Block #10 (horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n3. Red arch-shaped house: Block #1 (red arch block with an opening)\n4. Orange triangular roof: Block #15 (orange triangular block in the orientation shown)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on the structure, I need to build from the bottom up:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4\n  Step2: Move block with index 10\n  Step3: Move block with index 1\n  Step4: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence will create the structure shown in the main target image, starting with the green post, adding the yellow platform, placing the red arch house, and finally topping it with the orange triangular roof.",

Left structure: A red arch-like construction with yellow beams on top\n   - 4 red blocks (2 arch blocks at the bottom and 2 rectangular blocks on top)\n   - 3 yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally on top\n2. Right structure: An orange tower with yellow platforms\n   - 3 orange cylindrical blocks (2 at the bottom as supports and 1 tall one in the middle)\n   - 1 orange triangular block at the top of the tall cylinder\n   - 2 yellow rectangular blocks positioned as crossing platforms\n\nTotal blocks: 13 blocks across both structures\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- Left structure: \n  - Two red arch blocks (#1 and #2) form the base\n  - Two red rectangular blocks (#3) sit on top of the arches\n  - Three yellow rectangular blocks (#4, #5, and another #4) rest on top of the red blocks\n  \n- Right structure:\n  - Two orange cylindrical blocks (#9) form vertical supports at the bottom\n  - One taller orange cylindrical block (#9) stands in the middle\n  - An orange triangular block (#12) sits on top of the tall cylinder\n  - Two yellow rectangular blocks (#7 and #8) are positioned horizontally as crossing platforms\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required:\n- Block #1: Red arch block (used once)\n- Block #2: Red arch block (used once)\n- Block #3: Red rectangular block with vertical orientation (used twice)\n- Block #4: Yellow long rectangular block with horizontal orientation (used twice)\n- Block #5: Yellow rectangular block with horizontal orientation (used once)\n- Block #7: Yellow rectangular block with horizontal orientation (used once)\n- Block #8: Yellow rectangular block with horizontal orientation (used once)\n- Block #9: Orange cylindrical block with vertical orientation (used three times)\n- Block #12: Orange triangular block (used once)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 4\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n   Step9: Move block with index 9\n   Step10: Move block with index 9\n   Step11: Move block with index 12\n   Step12: Move block with index 7\n   Step13: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order follows a bottom-to-top approach for each structure, starting with the left structure and then building the right structure.",

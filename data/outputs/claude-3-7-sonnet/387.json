Left Structure:\n   - 4 blocks in total\n   - 3 layers (base, cylinder, top U-shape)\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - 5 blocks in total\n   - 3 layers (base cylinders, horizontal yellow blocks, triangular roof)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Left Structure\n- Bottom layer: A horizontal green rectangular block (base)\n- Middle layer: An orange cylinder standing vertically on the green base\n- Top layer: A green U-shaped structure consisting of three green blocks (two vertical blocks connected by a horizontal block) placed on top of the orange cylinder\n\n### Right Structure\n- Bottom layer: Two orange cylinders standing vertically side by side\n- Middle layer: Two yellow horizontal rectangular blocks placed across the top of the cylinders, forming a T-shape\n- Top layer: An orange triangular roof block placed on top of the taller cylinder\n\n# Selection of Required Blocks\n\nBased on the target image, I need to select the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 1) - for the base of the left structure\n2. Green vertical rectangular blocks (indices 2, 3) - for the vertical parts of the U-shape\n3. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 4) - for the horizontal part of the U-shape\n4. Orange cylindrical blocks (index 12) - 3 required (1 for left structure, 2 for right structure)\n5. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (indices 6, 7) - for the top of the right structure\n6. Orange triangular roof block (index 14) - for the top of the right structure\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 12\n  Step3: Move block with index 3\n  Step4: Move block with index 2\n  Step5: Move block with index 4\n  Step6: Move block with index 12\n  Step7: Move block with index 12\n  Step8: Move block with index 6\n  Step9: Move block with index 7\n  Step10: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the left structure from the bottom up, then proceeds to build the right structure from the bottom up.",

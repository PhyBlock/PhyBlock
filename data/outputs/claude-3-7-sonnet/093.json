It has:\n\n- Total blocks: 6 blocks\n- Number of layers: 4 layers\n\nSpatial arrangement:\n- Bottom layer: Two vertical green rectangular blocks forming \"legs\"\n- Second layer: One horizontal yellow rectangular block forming a \"seat\"\n- Third layer (torso): Two cubic blocks stacked vertically - a red cube at the bottom and a blue cube on top\n- Top layer: One curved yellow semi-cylindrical block forming a \"head\"\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Two green vertical rectangular blocks (for the legs) - Block index 7\n2. One yellow horizontal rectangular block (for the seat) - Block index 12\n3. One red cube (for the lower torso) - Block index 4\n4. One blue cube (for the upper torso) - Block index 1\n5. One yellow semi-cylindrical block (for the head) - Block index 13\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on a bottom-up assembly approach:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence starts with placing the two vertical green blocks as legs, followed by the horizontal yellow block as the seat. Then, the red cube is placed on the seat, followed by the blue cube on top of it. Finally, the yellow semi-cylindrical block is placed at the very top to complete the structure.",

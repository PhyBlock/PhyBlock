A left section resembling a train engine with arches\n2. A middle connecting section with tall green pillars\n3. A right section resembling a gate or archway\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- **Base layer**: Red arch blocks (1, 2) form the base of the left section, with yellow blocks (11) forming the base of the right section\n- **Middle layer**: Contains blue cubes (4), red cubes (7), yellow semi-cylinders (14, 16), green blocks of various shapes, and orange blocks\n- **Top layer**: Features yellow tall blocks (12, 13) and a long yellow horizontal block spanning the right section\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch block (index 1) - Used twice in the base of the left section\n2. Red arch/cutout block (index 2) - Used once in the left section\n3. Red arch/cutout block (index 3) - Used once in the left section\n4. Blue cube (index 4) - Used twice (once in left section, once in right section)\n5. Green cube (index 5) - Used twice (in left and middle sections)\n6. Orange cube (index 6) - Used once in the middle section\n7. Red cube (index 7) - Used twice (in both left and right sections)\n8. Green horizontal block (index 8) - Used once in the middle section\n9. Green vertical block (index 9) - Used once in the right section\n10. Green vertical block (index 10) - Used once in the right section\n11. Yellow horizontal block (index 11) - Used twice (as base and top of right section)\n12. Yellow vertical block (index 12) - Used twice in the left section\n13. Yellow vertical block (index 13) - Used once in the left section\n14. Yellow semi-cylinder (index 14) - Used twice in the left section\n15. Yellow cylinder (index 15) - Not used\n16. Yellow wedge/half cylinder (index 16) - Not used (actually I see it is used in the assembly)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n    Step11: Move block with index 14\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 5\n    Step14: Move block with index 5\n    Step15: Move block with index 6\n    Step16: Move block with index 12\n    Step17: Move block with index 12\n    Step18: Move block with index 13\n    Step19: Move block with index 11\n}\n```",

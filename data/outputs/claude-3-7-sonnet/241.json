A horizontal structure with 2 blocks (a red curved piece with a blue cube on top)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Vertical Tower (from bottom to top):\n- Bottom: Red block with a semicircular cutout/tunnel (facing front)\n- Second layer: Green rectangular flat block\n- Third layer: Two blocks side by side - a blue square block on the left and a yellow square block on the right\n- Fourth layer: Green rectangular flat block (identical to the second layer)\n- Top layer: Red block with a semicircular cutout/tunnel (facing front, identical to the bottom block)\n\n### Horizontal Structure:\n- Base: Red curved piece with two semicircular cutouts/tunnels\n- Top: Blue cube sitting on the middle section of the curved red base\n\n# Selection of Required Blocks\n\nBased on the analysis of the main image and the block dictionary, I need the following blocks:\n\nFor the vertical tower (bottom to top):\n- Index 6: Red block with semicircular cutout facing forward\n- Index 12: Green rectangular flat block\n- Index 8: Blue cube\n- Index 11: Yellow cube\n- Index 12: Green rectangular flat block (repeat)\n- Index 6: Red block with semicircular cutout facing forward (repeat)\n\nFor the horizontal structure:\n- Index 3: Red curved piece with two semicircular cutouts\n- Index 8: Blue cube\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 3\n   Step8: Move block with index 8\n}\n```",

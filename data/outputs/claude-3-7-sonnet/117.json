Red arch block - matches with block index 1\n2. Green rectangular block - matches with block index 7\n3. Orange triangular blocks (3 needed):\n   - Right side triangular block - matches with block index 15\n   - Left side triangular block - matches with block index 13\n   - Top triangular block - matches with block index 11\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 15\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly starts with the arch block as the foundation, then adds the triangular blocks to provide support on the sides and top, and finally places the green rectangular block on top to complete the structure.",

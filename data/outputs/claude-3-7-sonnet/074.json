Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Total Blocks**: 7 blocks\n- **Layers**: 3 layers (base layer, middle layer, top layer)\n- **Spatial Relationships**:\n  - Base Layer: 3 red arch blocks forming a base structure\n  - Middle Layer: 2 yellow rectangular blocks spanning horizontally across the red base blocks\n  - Top Layer: 1 red cube block with an arch and 1 orange triangular roof piece on top\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks are needed from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch blocks (indices 1, 2, and 3) - For the base layer\n2. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (indices 4 and 7) - For the middle layer\n3. Red arch block (index 2) - For the top layer\n4. Orange triangular roof piece (index 12) - For the very top\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the base layer (three red arch blocks), then adds the middle layer (two yellow rectangular blocks), and finishes with the top layer (red arch block topped with an orange triangular roof piece).",

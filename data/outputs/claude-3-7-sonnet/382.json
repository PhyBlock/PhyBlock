Right section: A building-like structure with panels\n\nTotal blocks: Approximately 19 distinct blocks\nLayers: The structure has multiple layers with blocks placed both vertically and horizontally\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n### Left Section (Archway Structure):\n- Has a red arch (block #2) at the top\n- Supported by two orange cylindrical pillars (block #11)\n- Has green rectangular blocks (block #8) on the left and right sides\n- Orange triangular blocks (blocks #13, #14, #15, #16) are positioned in various places including on top of the arch and near the base\n- A small half-circular red piece appears to be at the bottom of the arch\n\n### Right Section (Building Structure):\n- Has vertical green rectangular blocks (block #8) serving as pillars/supports\n- Contains yellow horizontal blocks (blocks #9 or #10) at the top and bottom\n- Has a red square panel (block #5) and a blue square panel (block #4) inside the structure\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, these are the blocks needed:\n- Block #2: Red arch (1 piece)\n- Block #4: Blue cube (1 piece)\n- Block #5: Red cube (1 piece)\n- Block #7: Green horizontal rectangle (1 piece)\n- Block #8: Green vertical rectangle (4 pieces)\n- Block #9/#10: Yellow horizontal rectangle (3 pieces)\n- Block #11: Orange cylinder (2 pieces)\n- Block #13/#14/#15/#16: Orange triangular blocks (4 pieces, possibly using different orientations)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7\n  Step2: Move block with index 8\n  Step3: Move block with index 8\n  Step4: Move block with index 9\n  Step5: Move block with index 9\n  Step6: Move block with index 5\n  Step7: Move block with index 4\n  Step8: Move block with index 10\n  Step9: Move block with index 8\n  Step10: Move block with index 8\n  Step11: Move block with index 11\n  Step12: Move block with index 11\n  Step13: Move block with index 2\n  Step14: Move block with index 13\n  Step15: Move block with index 15\n  Step16: Move block with index 14\n  Step17: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly begins with the right structure (building) by placing the foundation, then the pillars, panels, and top. Then we move to constructing the left structure (archway) with its pillars, arch, and decorative triangular pieces.",

A main section consisting of red arch blocks as the base\n2. Blue and orange/red cube blocks forming small house-like structures with triangular roofs\n3. Yellow cylinders and yellow rectangular blocks in the middle\n4. Green vertical blocks supporting the structure\n5. A separate small red arch block with triangular roof to the right of the main structure\n\n# Blocks Needed from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Red arch blocks (indices 1 and 2) - for the base of the structures\n2. Blue cube (index 4) - for the left \"house\" body\n3. Orange cube (index 5) - for the right \"house\" body\n4. Red cube (index 6) - for one of the structures\n5. Green vertical blocks (index 7) - for support pillars\n6. Yellow horizontal blocks (index 8 and 10) - for horizontal elements\n7. Yellow vertical blocks (index 9) - for the tall yellow elements\n8. Yellow half-cylinder blocks (index 11) - for the curved elements\n9. Orange triangular roof pieces (indices 14, 15, 16) - for the roof elements\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n    Step10: Move block with index 15\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n    Step12: Move block with index 7\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n    Step14: Move block with index 9\n    Step15: Move block with index 1\n    Step16: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the base structures, adds the middle elements, then builds upward to complete the structure, finishing with the separate small house structure on the right.",

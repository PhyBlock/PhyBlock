A tower-like structure on the left:\n   - Bottom: Two green vertical blocks side by side\n   - Middle: A horizontal yellow rectangular block placed on top of the green blocks\n   - Upper section: A red cube, then a blue cube stacked vertically\n   - Top: A yellow semi-cylindrical/dome block\n\n2. A vehicle-like structure on the right:\n   - Bottom: Two orange horizontal cylinders placed parallel to each other\n   - Middle: A yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the cylinders\n   - Middle-right: A yellow semi-cylindrical/dome block on top of the rectangular block\n   - Side: A blue cube placed next to but not on the vehicle structure\n\n## Block Count and Layers\n- Total blocks: 10 blocks\n- Left structure has 6 blocks with 4 layers\n- Right structure has 3 blocks with 3 layers, plus 1 standalone block\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Blue cubes (2): Block index 1\n2. Red cube (1): Block index 3\n3. Green vertical blocks (2): Block index 4\n4. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (1): Block index 6\n5. Yellow vertical blocks (0): Not needed\n6. Orange vertical cylinder (0): Not needed\n7. Orange horizontal cylinders (2): Block index 10\n8. Yellow semi-cylindrical/dome blocks (2): Block index 12\n9. Yellow items (0): Not needed\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4\n   Step2: Move block with index 4\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n   Step10: Move block with index 12\n   Step11: Move block with index 1\n}\n```",

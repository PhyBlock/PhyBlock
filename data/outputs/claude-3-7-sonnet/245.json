Base layer: Two blue cube blocks as \"legs\"\n2. Second layer: One yellow rectangular block as a \"bridge\" connecting the legs\n3. Third layer: Two blocks side by side (one blue cube and one red cube)\n4. Fourth layer: One green rectangular block\n5. Top layer: Orange triangular roof (appears to be made of 2 triangular pieces)\n\n### Right Structure (Vehicle/Train):\n- Total blocks: 6\n- Layers: 4\n1. Base layer: Orange cylindrical blocks (2 connected cylinders)\n2. Second layer: One green rectangular block\n3. Third layer: Two blocks stacked vertically (red cube at bottom, blue cube on top)\n4. Top layer: Orange triangular roof (appears to be one triangular piece)\n\n## Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\n### For Left Structure (House with Legs):\n- 1 (Blue cube) - Used 3 times for legs and side wall\n- 3 (Red cube) - Used 1 time for side wall\n- 6 or 7 (Green rectangular block) - Used 1 time for middle section\n- 9 or 10 (Yellow rectangular block) - Used 1 time for bridge section\n- 14 and 15 (Orange triangular pieces) - Used for roof (2 pieces)\n\n### For Right Structure (Vehicle/Train):\n- 1 (Blue cube) - Used 1 time for upper cube\n- 3 (Red cube) - Used 1 time for lower cube\n- 7 (Green rectangular block) - Used 1 time for base\n- 11 (Orange cylinder) - Used 2 times (or one double cylinder) for wheels\n- 16 (Orange triangular piece) - Used 1 time for roof\n\n## Assembly Order Instructions\n\n### Left Structure:\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 1\n  Step3: Move block with index 9\n  Step4: Move block with index 1\n  Step5: Move block with index 3\n  Step6: Move block with index 7\n  Step7: Move block with index 14\n  Step8: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\n### Right Structure:\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 11\n  Step2: Move block with index 11\n  Step3: Move block with index 7\n  Step4: Move block with index 3\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n  Step6: Move block with index 16\n}\n```",

Green rectangular horizontal blocks (indices 8 and 12)\n2. Green cube blocks (index 5)\n3. Blue cube blocks (index 4)\n4. Red blocks with curved cutouts (indices 1, 2, and 3)\n5. Orange/red triangular prism (index 14)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 4\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the red curved base for the right structure, then adds the blue cube, green rectangular block, and orange triangular prism on top. Then it builds the left structure starting with the green cube, red block with cutout, and finally adds the blue cube and green rectangular block on top.",

A larger castle-like structure on the right\n\nIn total, there are approximately 16 blocks used in the entire structure, arranged in multiple layers.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- Left Structure (Small House):\n  - Bottom: An orange arch block\n  - Middle: Red, green, and blue cube blocks\n  - Top: Orange triangular roof pieces\n\n- Right Structure (Castle):\n  - Bottom layer: Two red arch blocks connected by a red bridge block\n  - Second layer: A yellow rectangular block spanning across the arches\n  - Third layer: Two green cube blocks positioned on the yellow block\n  - Top layer: A red house-like structure with an arch opening and orange triangular roof\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Red arch blocks (indices 1 and 2) - for the bottom layer of both structures\n2. Blue cube block (index 6) - for the small house\n3. Green cube blocks (index 7) - for both structures\n4. Yellow rectangular blocks (indices 8 and 9) - for the bridge part\n5. Red cube block (index 5) - for the bridge and castle structure\n6. Orange triangular roof pieces (indices 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16) - for the roofs of both structures\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 10\n   Step10: Move block with index 11\n   Step11: Move block with index 5\n   Step12: Move block with index 6\n   Step13: Move block with index 7\n   Step14: Move block with index 14\n   Step15: Move block with index 15\n   Step16: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence begins with the foundation (arches and bridge), then builds up the castle structure, and finally completes the small house structure, moving from bottom to top for each component.",

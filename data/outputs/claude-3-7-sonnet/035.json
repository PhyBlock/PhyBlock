Two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks (for top and bottom) - Block indices 11 or 12\n2. Two vertical green rectangular blocks (for the sides) - Block indices 7 or 8\n3. One red cube - Block index 3\n4. One blue cube - Block index 1\n\nLooking at the exact orientations in the dictionary, I'll select:\n- Block 12 (yellow horizontal rectangle) for top and bottom\n- Block 8 (green vertical rectangle) for the sides\n- Block 3 (red cube)\n- Block 1 (blue cube)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 12\n  Step2: Move block with index 8\n  Step3: Move block with index 8\n  Step4: Move block with index 3\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n  Step6: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly would begin with placing the bottom horizontal yellow block, then adding the two vertical green blocks on its sides, followed by positioning the red cube on top of the left portion of the middle space, then the blue cube on the bottom right portion, and finally adding the top horizontal yellow block to complete the structure.",

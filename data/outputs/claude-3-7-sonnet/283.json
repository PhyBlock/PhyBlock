Middle layer: 5 blocks (2 yellow rectangular blocks, 3 red blocks with arches, and 4 green cube blocks)\n3. Top layer: 1 orange cylindrical pillar with a yellow half-cylinder cap\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The base consists of 5 orange cylindrical pillars arranged in a pattern - 4 at the corners and 1 in the middle of the front edge\n- On top of these pillars rests a platform made of 2 yellow rectangular blocks side by side\n- Extending to the left of the yellow platform are 3 red blocks with arches that form a bridge-like structure\n- Behind the red blocks are 4 green cube blocks in a row\n- On top of the rightmost yellow platform block stands a tall orange cylindrical pillar\n- The orange pillar is topped with a yellow half-cylinder cap\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n- 5× Block #12 (orange cylinder, vertical orientation)\n- 2× Block #11 (yellow rectangular block, horizontal orientation)\n- 3× Block #1 (red block with arch)\n- 4× Block #4 (green cube)\n- 1× Block #14 (yellow half-cylinder)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 4\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 4\n    Step14: Move block with index 4\n    Step15: Move block with index 12\n    Step16: Move block with index 14\n}\n```",

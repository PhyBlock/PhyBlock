Block 1 - Red arch block (left side of base)\n2. Block 2 - Red arch block (right side of base)\n3. Block 5 - Blue cube (for left house body)\n4. Block 7 - Orange cube (for right house body)\n5. Block 6 - Green cube (middle section)\n6. Block 6 - Green cube (second green cube)\n7. Block 8 - Tall green rectangular block (back right)\n8. Block 9 - Tall green rectangular block (back left)\n9. Block 12 - Tall yellow rectangular block (back right)\n10. Block 12 - Tall yellow rectangular block (back left)\n11. Block 14 - Yellow semi-cylindrical block (middle section)\n12. Block 14 - Yellow semi-cylindrical block (middle section)\n13. Block 15 - Orange triangular roof (left house)\n14. Block 16 - Orange triangular roof (right house)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 14\n   Step6: Move block with index 14\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 6\n   Step9: Move block with index 15\n   Step10: Move block with index 16\n   Step11: Move block with index 8\n   Step12: Move block with index 9\n   Step13: Move block with index 12\n   Step14: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the base arch blocks, then building the house structures, adding the middle elements, placing the roofs, and finally positioning the tall blocks at the back.",

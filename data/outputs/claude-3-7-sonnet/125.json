Block #14 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (left part of bottom layer)\n2. Block #15 - Yellow vertical rectangular block (right part of bottom layer)\n3. Block #3 - Red block with semicircular cutout (middle layer)\n4. Block #11 - Green horizontal rectangular block (third layer)\n5. Block #8 - Blue cube (left part of top layer)\n6. Block #8 - Blue cube (right part of top layer) - using the same block twice\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n}\n```",

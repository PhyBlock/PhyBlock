Two orange horizontal cylinders (index 14) - for the wheels\n2. Two yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (index 7) - for the platform/base\n3. One blue cube (index 1) - for the top left cargo\n4. One red cube (index 4) - for the top right cargo\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 14\n  Step2: Move block with index 14\n  Step3: Move block with index 7\n  Step4: Move block with index 7\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n  Step6: Move block with index 4\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence first places the wheels as the foundation, then builds the yellow platform on top of them, and finally places the blue and red cubic blocks on top of the platform to complete the structure.",

      "text": "## Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure is a castle-like construction consisting of several building blocks arranged in 3 main layers:\n\n1. **Bottom Layer (Layer 1)**: \n   - A red arch block (with a semicircular opening)\n   - Two tall orange cylindrical pillars on either side of the arch\n\n2. **Middle Layer (Layer 2)**:\n   - A horizontal green rectangular block placed on top of the red arch\n\n3. **Top Layer (Layer 3)**:\n   - A blue cubic/rectangular block placed on top of the green block\n   - An orange triangular roof/prism on top of the blue block\n\nTotal blocks used: 6 blocks (1 red arch, 2 orange cylinders, 1 green rectangle, 1 blue cube/rectangle, 1 orange triangular roof)\n\n## Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need to select the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch block: Block with index 1\n2. Orange cylindrical pillars: Block with index 11 (used twice)\n3. Green rectangular block: Block with index 10\n4. Blue rectangular/cubic block: This appears to be a taller blue rectangular block which is not exactly like index 6 (which is a small cube). The closest match would be to use multiple blue cubes (index 6), but since we need to match exactly, we need a block that's not clearly available in the dictionary.\n5. Orange triangular roof: Block with index 15\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on the structure's stability and logical building sequence:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 11\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 10\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nNote: For the blue rectangular part, I've indicated index 6 (blue cube), though this doesn't perfectly match the taller blue rectangular structure shown in the target image. The dictionary doesn't appear to contain a blue rectangular block with exactly the proportions shown in the target image.",

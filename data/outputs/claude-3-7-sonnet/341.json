Block index 1 - Red arch piece (left side)\n2. Block index 2 - Red arch piece (middle)\n3. Block index 3 - Red arch piece (right side)\n4. Block index 7 - Blue cube\n5. Block index 8 - Green vertical rectangular block (2 of these)\n6. Block index 12 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (2 of these)\n7. Block index 15 - Orange triangular block\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly order starts with the base (red arch pieces), builds upward with the yellow supports, adds the green vertical pieces, then the yellow top platform, and finally places the orange triangle on top and the blue cube to the side.",

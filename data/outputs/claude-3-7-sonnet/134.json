Block #1: Red arch block with semicircular cutout (left side of base)\n2. Block #2: Red arch block with semicircular cutout (right side of base)\n3. Block #6: Green vertical rectangular block (right side)\n4. Block #8: Yellow vertical rectangular block (back right)\n5. Block #9: Yellow vertical rectangular block (back left)\n6. Block #11: Orange vertical cylinder (middle)\n7. Block #14: Orange triangular roof (top)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 2\n  Step3: Move block with index 6\n  Step4: Move block with index 8\n  Step5: Move block with index 9\n  Step6: Move block with index 11\n  Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe assembly order starts with the base (red arch blocks), then adds the green vertical support, followed by the yellow background blocks, then the orange cylinder, and finally the triangular roof piece.",

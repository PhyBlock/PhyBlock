An orange triangular/wedge block is positioned on the right side.\n- Middle layer: The green cubic block is positioned on the left above one side of the red block. The blue cubic block is positioned on the right above the other side of the red block.\n- Top layer: Two orange triangular/roof pieces form a peaked roof structure above the green and blue blocks.\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Red block with tunnel/hole - Block index 2\n2. Yellow cubic blocks (2) - Block index 9\n3. Orange triangular/wedge block on right side - Block index 14\n4. Green cubic block - Block index 7\n5. Blue cubic block - Block index 6\n6. Orange triangular/roof pieces (2) - Block index 12\n\n# Assembly Order\n\nI'll start from the bottom layer, then middle, then top:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2\n  Step2: Move block with index 9\n  Step3: Move block with index 9\n  Step4: Move block with index 14\n  Step5: Move block with index 7\n  Step6: Move block with index 6\n  Step7: Move block with index 12\n  Step8: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence places the blocks in a logical bottom-to-top order, first creating the foundation, then adding the middle layer, and finally completing the structure with the roof pieces.",

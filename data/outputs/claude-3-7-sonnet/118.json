Base layer: Two orange cylindrical pillars (vertical orientation) side by side\n2. Middle layer: Two yellow rectangular blocks spanning horizontally across the two pillars\n3. Upper middle layer: One red rectangular block with an arch/tunnel (on the left side) and one blue cube (on the right side) sitting on the yellow blocks\n4. Top layer: An orange triangular roof piece sitting on the tallest orange cylindrical pillar\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n1. Two orange vertical cylindrical pillars - Block index 11\n2. Two yellow horizontal rectangular blocks - Block index 8\n3. One red rectangular block with an arch/tunnel - Block index 1\n4. One blue cube - Block index 5\n5. One orange triangular roof piece - Block index 15\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 11\n   Step2: Move block with index 11\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 11\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nNote: The structure appears to have three orange cylindrical pillars (one tall one on the left that extends higher than the others), but I'm using the same block index (11) for all cylindrical orange pillars as they appear to be the same block just placed at different heights.",

A castle/house-like structure on the left:\n   - Base: Red arch block with two orange cylindrical pillars on either side\n   - Middle layer: Green rectangular block placed horizontally across the red base\n   - Top layer: Blue cube with an orange triangular roof on top\n\n2. A simple bridge/bench-like structure on the right:\n   - Base: Two orange horizontal cylinders positioned parallel to each other\n   - Top: Yellow rectangular block placed horizontally across the cylinders\n\nTotal blocks used: 9 blocks across 2-3 layers per structure\n\n## Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nFor the castle/house structure:\n- Block 1: Red arch block for the base\n- Block 8: Orange vertical cylinder (used twice for the pillars)\n- Block 5: Green horizontal rectangular block for the middle layer\n- Block 2: Blue cube for the top house portion\n- Block 12: Orange triangular roof piece\n\nFor the bridge/bench structure:\n- Block 10: Orange horizontal cylinder (used twice for the base)\n- Block 6: Yellow horizontal rectangular block for the top\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence first builds the castle/house structure from bottom to top, then constructs the bridge/bench structure.",

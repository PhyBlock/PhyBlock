Orange cylindrical blocks (wheels) - Block index 14\n2. Yellow rectangular blocks (base platform) - Block indices 12 and 13\n3. Green rectangular block (back of train) - Block index 10\n4. Blue cubic block (middle cab) - Block index 1\n5. Red cubic block (front cab) - Block index 4\n6. Yellow cubic block (connecting piece) - Block index 5\n7. Yellow semi-cylindrical blocks (roof) - Block indices 15 and 16\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the wheels as the foundation, builds the base platform, adds the connecting blocks, constructs the cab section, and finally adds the roof elements to complete the toy train structure.",

Two yellow half-cylinder or arch-shaped blocks positioned side by side at the front\n2. One green cube block positioned behind the yellow blocks on the left\n3. One blue cube block positioned behind the yellow blocks on the right\n\nThe structure has all blocks placed on the same level (single layer), with the cubes at the back and the yellow arched shapes at the front.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nLooking at the block dictionary image, I can identify the following required blocks:\n\n1. For the blue cube: Block index 1 (blue cube)\n2. For the green cube: Block index 2 (green cube)\n3. For the two yellow half-cylinder/arch shapes: Block index 6 and Block index 7 (yellow arched shapes)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on the spatial arrangement, I'll provide the assembly sequence starting from the back to the front:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence places the green cube first, then the blue cube next to it, followed by the two yellow arch shapes in front of them, recreating the exact structure shown in the main target image.",

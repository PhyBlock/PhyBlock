Base Layer: 4 orange cylindrical pillars (arranged in a square formation)\n2. Second Layer: 2 yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally on top of the pillars\n3. Third Layer: 1 green cube and 1 blue cube stacked vertically\n4. Top Layer: 1 yellow semi-cylindrical/dome-shaped block\n\nAdditionally, there is a separate structure to the left consisting of:\n- 1 blue cube with 2 orange triangular/wedge blocks on either side\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the main target structure, I need the following blocks:\n- 4× Orange cylindrical pillars (index 5)\n- 2× Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (index 3)\n- 1× Green cube (index 2)\n- 1× Blue cube (index 1)\n- 1× Yellow dome/semi-cylindrical block (index 6)\n- 1× Blue cube (index 1) for the separate structure\n- 2× Orange triangular/wedge blocks (index 14) for the separate structure\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 3\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 14\n    Step12: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the base pillars, then adds the yellow rectangular platforms, followed by the green and blue cubes, and finally the yellow dome on top. The separate structure (blue cube with orange wedges) is assembled last.",

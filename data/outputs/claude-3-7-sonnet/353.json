Orange cylindrical blocks (vertical) - Block #8 (need 5 of these)\n2. Yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal) - Block #5 and Block #6 (need 3 of these in total)\n3. Yellow half-cylinder (cap) - Block #10 (need 1)\n4. Orange triangular/pyramid roof - Block #15 (need 1)\n5. Red block with tunnel/arch - Block #1 (need 1)\n6. Blue cube - Block #3 (need 1)\n7. Orange cylindrical block (horizontal) - Block #9 (need 1)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 6\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 3\n    Step12: Move block with index 8\n    Step13: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order begins with the left structure's base, builds upward, then moves to the right structure, building that from the ground up as well.",

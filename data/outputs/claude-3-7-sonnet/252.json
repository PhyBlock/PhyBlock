A train-like structure with various colored blocks\n\nTotal block count: Approximately 18-20 distinct blocks\nLayers: The structure has both horizontal and vertical components with 1-3 layers in different sections\n\n## Spatial Relationships\nThe structure has two distinct parts:\n\n**Left Side (Tower):**\n- Two vertical orange cylindrical pillars (one taller than the other)\n- Yellow rectangular blocks connecting the pillars\n- Orange triangular roof pieces on top of the yellow blocks\n\n**Right Side (Train):**\n- Red arch-like blocks forming the base/wheels\n- Yellow cylindrical blocks as the engine\n- Various colored blocks on top including:\n  - Blue cube\n  - Green rectangular blocks\n  - Yellow rectangular blocks\n  - Orange/red cube\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I'll need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch blocks (index 1, 2) - For the train base\n2. Blue cube (index 3) - For the train's upper section\n3. Orange/red cube (index 4) - For the train's upper section\n4. Green vertical block (index 5) - For the train's side\n5. Green horizontal block (index 6) - For the train's side\n6. Yellow horizontal blocks (index 7, 8) - For connecting tower elements and train parts\n7. Yellow vertical blocks (index 9, 10) - For the train's upper section\n8. Orange cylindrical blocks (index 11) - For the tower pillars\n9. Yellow half-cylinder blocks (index 12) - For the train's engine\n10. Yellow rectangular blocks (index 13, 14) - For structural elements\n11. Orange flat piece (index 15) - Possibly for connecting elements\n12. Orange triangular roof pieces (index 16) - For the tower tops\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 2\n    Step12: Move block with index 1\n    Step13: Move block with index 12\n    Step14: Move block with index 12\n    Step15: Move block with index 3\n    Step16: Move block with index 9\n    Step17: Move block with index 10\n    Step18: Move block with index 5\n    Step19: Move block with index 6\n    Step20: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from the ground up, starting with the tower base, then the connecting blocks, tower tops, and finally the train component from left to right.",

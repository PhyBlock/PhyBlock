Base layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block (#9, #10, #11, or #12)\n2. Middle-bottom layer: Two red blocks with a circular hole/tunnel through them (#2 and #3)\n3. Middle layer: Another yellow horizontal rectangular block similar to the base\n4. Middle-top layer: Two cube blocks side by side - one blue (#4) and one red (#5)\n5. Upper layer: One green horizontal rectangular block (#7)\n6. Top layer: Two orange triangular roof blocks (#14, #15, or #16)\n\n## Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\n- Block #4: Blue cube (for the middle-top left side)\n- Block #5: Red cube (for the middle-top right side)\n- Block #7: Green horizontal rectangular block (for the upper layer)\n- Block #9 or #10: Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (for the base and middle layers)\n- Block #2 and #3: Red curved blocks with semicircular cutouts (combined to create the tunnel)\n- Block #15: Orange triangular roof block (for the top layer)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the base yellow block, builds the red tunnel section, adds the second yellow block platform, places the blue and red cubes side by side, adds the green horizontal block on top, and finishes with the two orange triangular roof pieces.",

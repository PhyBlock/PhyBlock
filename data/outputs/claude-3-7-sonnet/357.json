The structure consists of multiple layers of various colored blocks arranged in a specific configuration.\n\n## Block Count and Layers\n- Total blocks used: Approximately 16 distinct blocks\n- The structure has 2-3 layers in most places\n\n## Spatial Relationships\nThe structure can be divided into several parts:\n1. **Base/Track**: Red curved and arched blocks form the foundation\n2. **Main Train Body**: Contains blue cubes, red base blocks, and yellow cylindrical elements\n3. **Houses/Buildings**: Orange-roofed structures on top of the train\n4. **Separate Building**: A standalone blue cube with green rectangular top and orange triangular roof\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I will identify the blocks needed from the dictionary image:\n\n1. Red arch blocks (#1) - Used as the base of the train\n2. Red curved ramp blocks (#2, #3) - Used for the curved track sections\n3. Red vertical end piece (#4) - Used at the end of the track\n4. Blue cubes (#5) - Used for the train car bodies and separate building\n5. Orange/red cubes (#6, #15) - Used for the main house/building section\n6. Red cube (#7) - Used in the train structure\n7. Green horizontal rectangle (#8) - Used on top of the separate building\n8. Green vertical rectangle (#9) - Used as vertical supports\n9. Yellow horizontal block (#10) - Used at the top of the train\n10. Yellow vertical block/tower (#11) - Used as vertical elements\n11. Yellow curved/cylindrical block (#12) - Used in the train\n12. Yellow cylinder (#13) - Used in the train structure\n13. Orange triangular roof pieces (#16) - Used for all rooftops\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 5\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 12\n   Step9: Move block with index 13\n   Step10: Move block with index 15\n   Step11: Move block with index 9\n   Step12: Move block with index 11\n   Step13: Move block with index 11\n   Step14: Move block with index 16\n   Step15: Move block with index 16\n   Step16: Move block with index 5\n   Step17: Move block with index 8\n   Step18: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the base/track components (the red arch and curved pieces), then builds up the train body with the blue cubes and other structural elements, adds the yellow elements, and finishes with the rooftops.",

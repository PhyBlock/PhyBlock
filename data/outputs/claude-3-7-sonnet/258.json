Left Structure (House-like):\n   - 3 layers total\n   - Bottom layer: 2 green vertical blocks as pillars\n   - Middle layer: 1 yellow horizontal block as a bridge\n   - Top layer: 1 red arch block with an orange triangular roof\n\n2. Right Structure (Bridge/Castle-like):\n   - 3 layers total\n   - Bottom layer: 2 red arch blocks in the middle with 2 green vertical blocks on the sides\n   - Middle layer: 3 yellow half-cylinder blocks and 2 yellow vertical blocks\n   - No distinct top layer, but the yellow vertical blocks extend upward\n\nTotal block count: Approximately 14 blocks across both structures\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- Left Structure: Two green pillars (blocks 3 and 4) support a horizontal yellow block (block 6), topped with a red arch block (block 1) and an orange triangular roof piece (block 15).\n- Right Structure: Two red arch blocks (block 1) form a bridge, with two green vertical blocks (block 5) on the outer sides. Above the arches are yellow half-cylinder blocks (block 11 and block 12). Two tall yellow vertical blocks (block 8 and block 9) rise from the back of the structure.\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the main target image, the following blocks are needed:\n\n1. Block 1 (Red arch) - Used 3 times (once in left structure, twice in right structure)\n2. Block 3 (Green vertical tall) - Used 2 times (as pillars in left structure)\n3. Block 5 (Green rectangular) - Used 2 times (as side supports in right structure)\n4. Block 6 (Yellow horizontal) - Used 1 time (as bridge in left structure)\n5. Block 8 (Yellow vertical tall) - Used 2 times (as towers in right structure)\n6. Block 10 (Yellow horizontal) - Used 1 time (in right structure)\n7. Block 11 (Yellow half-cylinder) - Used 2 times (on top of arches in right structure)\n8. Block 15 (Orange triangular roof) - Used 1 time (as roof in left structure)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 15\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 5\n   Step10: Move block with index 8\n   Step11: Move block with index 10\n   Step12: Move block with index 8\n   Step13: Move block with index 11\n   Step14: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly follows a bottom-up approach for each structure, starting with the left house-like structure before moving to the right bridge/castle-like structure.",

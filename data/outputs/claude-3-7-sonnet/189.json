There are approximately 20 blocks used in total, arranged in 2-3 layers depending on the section.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\nThe structure consists of several key components from left to right:\n1. A blue cube with an orange triangular roof (house)\n2. A bridge section made of red arched blocks\n3. Yellow cylindrical blocks on top of the bridge\n4. Two yellow tall rectangular blocks in the back\n5. Green rectangular blocks in various positions\n6. Multiple orange cube houses with triangular roofs\n7. Orange triangular walls at the end sections\n\n# Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch blocks (indices 1, 2, 3) - for the bridge sections\n2. Blue cube (index 4) - for the leftmost house\n3. Green cubes (index 5) - for the base of some buildings and vertical sections\n4. Orange cubes (index 6) - for the house bodies\n5. Green vertical rectangles (index 7) - for taller green sections\n6. Yellow vertical rectangles (indices 8, 9) - for the tall yellow blocks in the back\n7. Yellow cylindrical blocks (indices 10, 11) - for the curved sections on the bridge\n8. Orange triangular roof pieces (indices 14, 15, 16) - for the roofs and wall sections\n9. Orange vertical wall (index 13) - for the vertical divider\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2  \n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 14\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 14\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n   Step9: Move block with index 11\n   Step10: Move block with index 8\n   Step11: Move block with index 9\n   Step12: Move block with index 5\n   Step13: Move block with index 7\n   Step14: Move block with index 5\n   Step15: Move block with index 7\n   Step16: Move block with index 6\n   Step17: Move block with index 14\n   Step18: Move block with index 16\n   Step19: Move block with index 13\n   Step20: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from the left side (starting with the bridge foundation), then adds the houses and decorative elements, and finally completes the right side of the structure.",

Red arch blocks (indices 1 and 2) for the base/foundation\n2. Vertical blocks: Blue cube (5), Green cubes (6, 9), Orange cube (7)\n3. Yellow tall blocks (10)\n4. Yellow cube block (11) \n5. Yellow semicircular blocks (12, 13)\n6. Orange triangular roof pieces (14, 15, 16)\n7. Green rectangular block (8)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 16\n   Step5: Move block with index 5\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 12\n   Step8: Move block with index 13\n   Step9: Move block with index 14\n   Step10: Move block with index 14\n   Step11: Move block with index 6\n   Step12: Move block with index 9\n   Step13: Move block with index 8\n   Step14: Move block with index 10\n   Step15: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the base red arches, then adding the main body blocks, and finally placing the taller elements and roof pieces to complete the structure.",

Here's my detailed analysis:\n\n- **Total Block Count**: 7 blocks\n- **Layers**: 4 visible layers from bottom to top\n- **Spatial Arrangement**:\n  - Bottom layer: A horizontal green rectangular block\n  - Middle-lower layer: Two vertical yellow rectangular blocks forming the sides of the doorway, with a red cube inside\n  - Middle-upper layer: A blue cube inside the doorway above the red cube, and a yellow triangular block at the back\n  - Top layer: A horizontal green rectangular block\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the main image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Green horizontal rectangular blocks (2) - matching block #6\n2. Yellow vertical rectangular blocks (2) - matching block #14\n3. Blue cube (1) - matching block #1\n4. Red cube (1) - matching block #4\n5. Yellow triangular block (1) - This appears to be a yellow cube (#5) viewed from an angle that makes it look triangular\n\n## Block Indices List\n- Block #6 (green horizontal rectangle) - 2 pieces\n- Block #14 (yellow vertical rectangle) - 2 pieces\n- Block #1 (blue cube) - 1 piece\n- Block #4 (red cube) - 1 piece\n- Block #5 (yellow cube) - 1 piece\n\n## Assembly Order\nI'll start building from the bottom up:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence will create the portal-like structure shown in the main target image, with the green rectangular blocks at top and bottom, yellow vertical rectangles forming the sides, and the blue and red cubes stacked in the middle, with the yellow cube acting as a triangular back piece.",

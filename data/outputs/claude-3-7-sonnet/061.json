Block with index 1 (red arch block, facing left)\n2. Block with index 2 (red arch block, facing right)\n3. Block with index 6 (red arch block with opening in front)\n4. Block with index 7 (blue cube)\n5. Block with index 8 (green cube)\n6. Block with index 11 (yellow rectangular block, oriented horizontally)\n7. Block with index 13 (orange triangular roof piece)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the ground up, starting with the foundation (red arch blocks), then adding the middle horizontal yellow block, followed by the green and blue cubes, then the top red arch block, and finally the orange triangular roof.",

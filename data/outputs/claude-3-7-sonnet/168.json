It has:\n\n- Total blocks: Approximately 11-12 distinct blocks\n- Layers: 2 main layers (base layer and top layer)\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n1. Base layer:\n   - Red arch block with two openings on the left side\n   - Orange cylindrical supports (four cylinders) on the right side\n   - Green connecting piece in the middle\n\n2. Top layer:\n   - Yellow rectangular block at the left-back\n   - Orange cylindrical tower with orange triangular roof on the left front\n   - Green rectangular blocks stacked on the right side\n   \nThe overall structure has a left section that resembles a small house/tower and a right section that looks like a platform supported by cylindrical pillars.\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Block #1 - Red arch block for the left base\n2. Block #12 - Orange cylinder (used multiple times for the tower and support pillars)\n3. Block #10 and #11 - Yellow vertical rectangular blocks for the rear section\n4. Block #4, #5, #7, and #8 - Green rectangular blocks in various orientations for the middle and top right\n5. Block #13 - Orange triangular roof piece for the top of the orange tower\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n   Step7: Move block with index 12\n   Step8: Move block with index 12\n   Step9: Move block with index 4\n   Step10: Move block with index 5\n   Step11: Move block with index 7\n   Step12: Move block with index 8\n   Step13: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the base layer (red arch and green connecting piece), followed by the yellow blocks, then the orange cylindrical supports and tower, then the green blocks on top, and finally the orange triangular roof piece.",

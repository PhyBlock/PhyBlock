Orange cylindrical wheels (horizontal orientation) - Block #14 (need 2)\n2. Red arch blocks for the engine - Blocks #1 and #2 (one of each)\n3. Yellow half-cylinder tops - Block #15 (need 2)\n4. Tall yellow rectangular blocks for smokestacks - Block #12 (need 2)\n5. Green rectangular vertical blocks - Blocks #9 and #10 (one of each)\n6. Yellow horizontal rectangular block for flatbed - Block #11\n7. Green horizontal rectangular blocks - Blocks #7 and #8 (one of each)\n8. Blue cube - Block #5\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 12\n    Step12: Move block with index 12\n    Step13: Move block with index 11\n    Step14: Move block with index 5\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the wheels, then the engine body, adding details like the half-cylinders, the vertical elements, and finally the flatbed with the blue cube on top.",

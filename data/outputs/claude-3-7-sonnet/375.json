I'll describe each part separately.\n\n### Left Tower Structure:\n- Has 3 main layers vertically\n- Bottom layer: Red block with circular hole (block #1), with yellow rectangular platform (block #7) on top\n- Middle layer: Two green vertical rectangular blocks (blocks #5 and #6) with a yellow rectangular platform (block #7) on top\n- Top layer: Yellow rectangular platform (block #7) with an orange triangular prism (block #14) on top\n\n### Right Complex Structure:\n- Has a base: Green rectangular block (block #4) supporting an orange cylindrical column (block #10)\n- Main framework: Three yellow horizontal platforms (blocks #7 and #8) connected by green vertical supports (blocks #5 and #6)\n- Middle section: Contains an orange triangular prism (block #15)\n- Top section: Has a green rectangular block (block #4) with a blue cube (block #3) on top\n\n### Total Block Count:\nThe structure uses approximately 18 individual blocks of various types.\n\n## Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n1. Red block with circular hole (index 1)\n2. Blue cube (index 3)\n3. Green horizontal rectangular blocks (index 4) - used 3 times\n4. Green vertical rectangular blocks (index 5) - used 2 times \n5. Green vertical rectangular blocks (index 6) - used 2 times\n6. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (index 7) - used 3 times\n7. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (index 8) - used 1 time\n8. Orange vertical cylinder (index 10) - used 1 time\n9. Orange triangular prism in orientation #14 - used 1 time\n10. Orange triangular prism in orientation #15 - used 1 time\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4 (green horizontal base for right structure)\n   Step2: Move block with index 10 (orange vertical cylinder)\n   Step3: Move block with index 7 (bottom yellow platform of right structure)\n   Step4: Move block with index 5 (left green vertical support in right structure)\n   Step5: Move block with index 6 (right green vertical support in right structure)\n   Step6: Move block with index 7 (middle yellow platform of right structure)\n   Step7: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular prism in right structure)\n   Step8: Move block with index 5 (left green vertical support in upper right structure)\n   Step9: Move block with index 6 (right green vertical support in upper right structure)\n   Step10: Move block with index 8 (top yellow platform of right structure)\n   Step11: Move block with index 4 (green block on top of right structure)\n   Step12: Move block with index 3 (blue cube at the very top)\n   Step13: Move block with index 1 (red block with circular hole for left structure)\n   Step14: Move block with index 7 (yellow platform above red block)\n   Step15: Move block with index 5 (left green vertical support in left structure)\n   Step16: Move block with index 6 (right green vertical support in left structure)\n   Step17: Move block with index 7 (top yellow platform of left structure)\n   Step18: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular prism at top of left structure)\n}\n```",

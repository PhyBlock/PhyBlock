Bottom layer: 3 blocks (2 orange cylindrical blocks and 1 yellow rectangular block at the base)\n2. Middle layer: 3 blocks (2 green rectangular blocks and 1 yellow rectangular block)\n3. Top layer: 4 blocks (1 orange triangular prism and 1 yellow rectangular block)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- Bottom layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block (platform) with two orange vertical cylindrical blocks standing on it\n- Middle layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block (platform) with two green vertical rectangular blocks standing on it\n- Top layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block (platform) with an orange triangular prism on top of it\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n1. For the bottom layer:\n   - Block 4: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (base platform)\n   - Block 8: Orange vertical cylindrical block (2 of these)\n\n2. For the middle layer:\n   - Block 4: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (middle platform)\n   - Block 2: Green vertical rectangular block (2 of these)\n\n3. For the top layer:\n   - Block 4: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (top platform)\n   - Block 12: Orange triangular prism\n\nSo the list of required block indices is: 4, 8, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 12\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 2\n   Step7: Move block with index 4\n   Step8: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, starting with the base platform, adding the cylindrical blocks, then the middle platform, followed by the vertical rectangular blocks, then the top platform, and finally the triangular prism on top.",

Two orange cylindrical blocks (wheels): Block index 10\n2. Green rectangular block: Block index 8\n3. Red cube: Block index 3\n4. Blue cube: Block index 1\n\n## For Structure 2 (Right side):\n1. Green cube (center): Block index 2\n2. Blue rectangular blocks (four needed): Block index 7\n3. Orange triangular prisms/wedges (two needed): Block index 15\n\n# Assembly Order\n\nFor Structure 1 (Vehicle with tower):\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 10\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nFor Structure 2 (Star/cross shape):\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 7\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 15\n   Step7: Move block with index 15\n}\n```",

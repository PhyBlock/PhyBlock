The blocks are connected side by side to create a structure with 3 arches total.\n\n**Layer 2 (Top):**\n- One green rectangular block placed horizontally across the middle portion of the red base blocks.\n- One red rectangular block with an arch, placed on top of the green block.\n\n**Spatial Relationships:**\n- The bottom layer has two red blocks with arches positioned side by side.\n- The green block rests horizontally on top of the bottom red blocks, spanning across the middle.\n- The top red block with an arch sits on the green block, aligned with the right side of the structure.\n\n## Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on the dictionary image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. For the bottom layer: Block indices 1 and 2 (red blocks with arches)\n2. For the middle green block: Block index 10 (horizontal green rectangular block)\n3. For the top red block: Block index 1 (red block with arch)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the bottom layer (the two red arch blocks), then places the horizontal green block on top, and finally places the red arch block on the very top to complete the structure.",

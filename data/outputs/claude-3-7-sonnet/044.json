Second layer: 1 red block with a circular hole through it\n3. Third layer: 1 yellow rectangular block with 2 orange cylindrical pillars on top\n4. Top layer: 1 yellow rectangular block with 1 orange triangular prism (tent-shaped) on top\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The bottom layer has a horizontal yellow rectangular block as the foundation\n- Above this is a red block with a circular hole/tunnel through its center\n- The third layer has a yellow rectangular block supporting two orange cylindrical pillars\n- The top layer has another yellow rectangular block spanning across the pillars, with an orange triangular prism (tent-shaped) block positioned on top of it\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n1. Block 7: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (used 3 times, for bottom, middle, and top horizontal supports)\n2. Block 3: Red block with circular hole (used 1 time, for the second layer)\n3. Block 11: Orange cylindrical pillar in vertical orientation (used 2 times, for the pillars)\n4. Block 15: Orange triangular prism (tent-shaped) (used 1 time, for the top decoration)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, starting with the foundation and adding each layer sequentially until completing with the triangular prism on top.",

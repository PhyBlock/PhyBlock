      "text": "# Analysis of the Target Structure\n\nI can see a block structure that resembles a construction vehicle (like an excavator or loader) composed of multiple colored blocks. The structure has the following characteristics:\n\n## Overall Structure Description:\n- The structure has 15 total blocks arranged in multiple layers\n- The structure is made of blocks in red, yellow, green, and orange colors\n- It appears to be a construction vehicle with a cab section on the left and a scoop/bucket section on the right\n\n## Layers and Spatial Arrangement:\n1. Base layer: Red arch blocks forming the base/wheels on the left side, and orange cylindrical blocks on the right\n2. Middle layer: Yellow curved blocks on the red arches, green rectangular blocks, and a triangular orange block\n3. Top layer: Tall yellow rectangular blocks in the back left, green rectangular blocks in the middle\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Two red arch blocks (index 1) for the left base\n2. Two yellow curved blocks (index 13) for the top of the arches\n3. Two tall yellow rectangular blocks (index 9) for the cab section\n4. Four green rectangular blocks: three vertical (index 7) and one horizontal (index 6)\n5. Two orange cylindrical blocks (index 11 and 12) for the right base/wheels\n6. One orange triangular block (index 16) for the right section\n7. One orange cube block (index 15) for the right section\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n    Step10: Move block with index 7\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n    Step12: Move block with index 7\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n    Step14: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the base components (arches and cylinders), then adds the curved blocks on top of the arches, followed by the rectangular and triangular components, and finally the tall vertical blocks for the cab section.",

It consists of approximately 16 blocks arranged in a configuration that resembles a train with:\n- Base layer: Red arch blocks forming the \"wheels\" or foundation\n- Middle layer: Yellow horizontal blocks, blue cube blocks, green vertical blocks\n- Top layer: Yellow vertical towers, green blocks, orange triangular component\n\nThe structure has primarily 2-3 layers in height, with some sections reaching 3 blocks high.\n\n## 2. Spatial Relationships:\n- The base consists of 4 red arch blocks (with curved cutouts) that serve as the train's \"wheels\"\n- Two yellow vertical blocks stand at the left side of the structure\n- Two green vertical blocks are positioned in the middle section\n- Two blue cube blocks are positioned in the central area\n- A yellow horizontal block connects parts of the middle section\n- At the right end, there's a green horizontal block with an orange triangular block on top\n\n## 3. Required Blocks from Dictionary:\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n- Block 1 (Red arch block) - used 2 times\n- Block 2 (Red arch block in different orientation) - used 2 times\n- Block 4 (Blue cube) - used 2 times\n- Block 6 (Yellow cube) - used for base elements\n- Block 7 (Green horizontal rectangle) - used for middle structure\n- Block 8 (Green vertical rectangle) - used 2 times\n- Block 11 (Yellow horizontal rectangle) - used for middle connectors\n- Block 12 (Yellow vertical rectangle) - used 2 times\n- Block 14 (Orange triangular block) - used once for the top right section\n\n## 4. Assembly Order:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 4\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 8\n    Step13: Move block with index 7\n    Step14: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order works from the bottom up, starting with the wheel/base components, then adding the middle connecting structure, followed by the vertical components, and finally the top elements.",

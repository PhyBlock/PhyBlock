Green horizontal rectangular blocks (for top and bottom) - Block indices 6 and 10 appear suitable\n2. Yellow vertical rectangular blocks (for the sides) - Block indices 13 and 14 appear suitable\n3. Red cube (for the interior) - Block index 4\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nThe logical assembly order would be from bottom to top:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence places the bottom green block first, then adds the two yellow vertical blocks to create the frame, places the red cube inside the frame, and finally tops it with the green rectangular block.",

Red arch block (index 1) - used for the front of the structure\n2. Red curved/tunnel block (index 3) - used for the middle section\n3. Blue cube blocks (index 4) - two of these are used on top of the green platform\n4. Red cube block (index 5) - possibly used as support\n5. Green rectangular blocks (index 6 and index 8) - used as platforms and supports\n6. Green vertical block (index 7) - used as vertical support\n7. Yellow rectangular block (index 9) - used as horizontal support\n8. Yellow tall blocks (index 10) - used as vertical columns, need at least 3\n9. Orange cube block (index 11) - used in the rear section\n10. Orange triangular blocks (indices 12, 13, 14, 15, and/or 16) - used for the angled sections at the rear\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 10\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 3\n   Step10: Move block with index 6\n   Step11: Move block with index 8\n   Step12: Move block with index 4\n   Step13: Move block with index 4\n   Step14: Move block with index 11\n   Step15: Move block with index 12\n   Step16: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds from the bottom up, starting with the base supports, then adding the vertical elements, followed by the horizontal platforms, and finally the top elements.",

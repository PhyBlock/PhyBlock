      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n## Count & Layers\nThe target structure appears to be a toy train or vehicle-like construction with multiple sections. It consists of approximately 22 blocks arranged in 3 layers:\n- Bottom layer: Red arch blocks forming the base/wheels\n- Middle layer: Various blocks forming the body of the train\n- Top layer: Blocks creating structures on top of the train cars\n\n## Spatial Relationships\nThe structure can be divided into sections from left to right:\n\n1. **First Car (Engine)**:\n   - Bottom: Two red arch blocks (front and rear)\n   - Middle: Yellow rectangular block spanning the arches\n   - Top: Two green cubic blocks on the left and right sides, with a blue vertical rectangular block in the middle, and an orange triangular roof piece on top of the blue block\n\n2. **Second Car**:\n   - Bottom: Two red arch blocks\n   - Middle: Blue cube, yellow cylindrical blocks, and vertically standing yellow blocks\n   - Top: No blocks\n\n3. **Third Car**:\n   - Bottom: Red arch blocks\n   - Middle: Orange cube on the left side, green vertical rectangular block on the right side\n   - Top: No blocks\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch blocks (index 1 and 2) - used 4-5 times\n2. Blue cube blocks (index 3) - used 2 times\n3. Green cube blocks (index 4) - used 2-3 times\n4. Orange cube blocks (index 5) - used 1 time\n5. Blue small cube blocks (index 6) - not clearly visible in target\n6. Blue vertical rectangular blocks (index 7) - used 1 time\n7. Green horizontal rectangular blocks (index 8) - used 1 time\n8. Green vertical rectangular blocks (index 9) - used 1 time\n9. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (index 10 or 12) - used 1 time\n10. Yellow vertical rectangular blocks (index 11) - used 2 times\n11. Yellow cylindrical/half-circle blocks (index 13) - used 2 times\n12. Orange triangular roof piece (index 16) - used 1 time\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 4\n   Step7: Move block with index 4\n   Step8: Move block with index 7\n   Step9: Move block with index 16\n   Step10: Move block with index 3\n   Step11: Move block with index 13\n   Step12: Move block with index 13\n   Step13: Move block with index 11\n   Step14: Move block with index 11\n   Step15: Move block with index 5\n   Step16: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order places the foundation arch blocks first, then builds the train from front to back, placing the bottom layer first, followed by the middle blocks, and finally the top blocks for each section of the train.",

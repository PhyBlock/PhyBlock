Main structure (right side):\n   - A red block with a large circular hole in the center\n   - Two yellow horizontal rectangular blocks: one above and one below the red block\n   - A red block with two arches at the bottom\n\n2. Side extension (left side):\n   - A red block with two semi-circular cutouts\n   - A blue cube sitting on top of the red block\n\nThe two parts are connected by the bottom layer.\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, these are the blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red block with arch (index 1) - used for bottom right part\n2. Red block with arch (index 2) - used for bottom right part\n3. Red curved cutout block (index 3) - used for left extension part\n4. Red curved cutout block (index 4) - not used\n5. Red circular cutout block (index 5) - used for middle block with hole\n6. Red circular cutout block (index 6) - not used\n7. Red circular cutout block (index 7) - not used\n8. Red circular cutout block (index 8) - not used\n9. Blue cube (index 9) - used for top of left extension\n10. Green cube (index 10) - not used\n11. Orange cube (index 11) - not used\n12. Red cube (index 12) - not used\n13. Yellow cube (index 13) - not used\n14. Yellow horizontal rectangle (index 14) - not used\n15. Yellow horizontal rectangle (index 15) - used for middle layer beneath hole block\n16. Yellow horizontal rectangle (index 16) - used for top of the right structure\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 15\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 16\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 3\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from the middle outward, starting with the yellow base for the central hole block, then adding the hole block itself, followed by the top yellow block. Then we add the bottom arched blocks and finally the left extension with the blue cube on top.",

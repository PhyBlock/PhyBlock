Block with index 7: Orange horizontal cylinder (for the base/vehicle body)\n2. Block with index 2: Green horizontal rectangular block (for the top platform)\n3. Block with index 6: Orange horizontal cylinder (for the second wheel)\n4. Block with index 14: Orange triangular block in right-facing orientation (for the scoop/blade)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first creates the wheeled base using the two orange cylindrical blocks (7 and 6), then places the green rectangular platform (2) on top, and finally adds the orange triangular blade (14) to complete the structure.",

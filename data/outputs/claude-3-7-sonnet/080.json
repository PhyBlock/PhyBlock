Green rectangular blocks (horizontal orientation) - Block index 9 and 11\n2. Red arch block (for the doorway) - Block index 1\n3. Blue cube - Block index 7\n4. Green cube - Block index 8\n5. Orange triangular/slope blocks - Block indices 14, 15, and 16\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n    Step10: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly begins with placing the green rectangular base blocks first, followed by the red archway. Then we add the cube blocks for the middle section, and finally place the orange triangular roof pieces to complete the structure.",

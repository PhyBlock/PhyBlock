The structure has the following characteristics:\n\n- **Block Count**: The structure uses approximately 8-9 blocks.\n- **Layers**: The structure appears to have 2 layers - a base layer and a top layer.\n- **Spatial Arrangement**: \n  - The structure has a central portion made of blue blocks forming a T-shape\n  - There's a green block at the top center of the structure\n  - Orange/red blocks are positioned around the blue T-shape\n  - Some orange triangular/wedge shapes appear to be used for the corners\n\n## Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need to identify the specific blocks from the dictionary needed to recreate the target structure.\n\nRequired blocks by their indices:\n- Blue blocks: #1, #6, #7 (for the T-shape)\n- Green block: #2 (for the top center)\n- Orange/red blocks: #9, #10, #11, #14, #15 (for the surrounding elements)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nHere is the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n   Step7: Move block with index 14\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n   Step9: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with creating the blue T-shape core structure, then adds the green top block, and finally places the orange/red blocks around the periphery to complete the structure.",

Left Tower Structure:\n   - 7 blocks total: 3 yellow rectangular blocks, 2 orange cylindrical pillars, 1 red block with a hole, and 1 orange triangular roof\n   - 4 layers from bottom to top\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - 6 blocks total: 2 yellow rectangular blocks, 2 green rectangular blocks, 1 orange cylindrical pillar, and 1 orange triangular roof\n   - 4 layers from bottom to top\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Left Tower Structure:\n- Bottom (1st layer): Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- 2nd layer: Red block with circular hole\n- 3rd layer: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation) with two orange cylinders standing on it\n- Top (4th layer): Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation) with an orange triangular roof on top\n\n### Right Structure:\n- Bottom (1st layer): Green rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- 2nd layer: Orange cylindrical pillar standing on the green base\n- 3rd layer: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation) with two green rectangular blocks (vertical orientation) at both ends\n- Top (4th layer): Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation) with an orange triangular roof on one side\n\n# Selection of Required Blocks\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red block with hole (index 1) - appears once in the left structure\n2. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (index 10) - appears 5 times (3 in left structure, 2 in right structure)\n3. Orange cylindrical pillars (index 11 and index 13) - total of 3 (2 in left structure, 1 in right structure)\n4. Orange triangular roofs (index 16) - appears twice (1 on each structure)\n5. Green horizontal rectangular blocks (index 4 and index 9) - appear in the right structure\n6. Green vertical rectangular blocks (index 6 and index 7) - appear in the right structure\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 10\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n   Step6: Move block with index 10\n   Step7: Move block with index 16\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n   Step9: Move block with index 11\n   Step10: Move block with index 10\n   Step11: Move block with index 6\n   Step12: Move block with index 7\n   Step13: Move block with index 10\n   Step14: Move block with index 16\n}\n```",

      "text": "## Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure consists of multiple building blocks arranged in a complex design with two main sections:\n\n1. **Left Section**: A tower-like structure made of red blocks with arches, with a yellow connecting bar across the middle\n2. **Right Section**: A base made of red blocks with arches, green and yellow layers on top, and an orange cylindrical tower with a triangular roof\n\n### Block Count and Layers:\n- Total blocks: approximately 14-15 blocks\n- The structure has multiple layers, with the tallest section (orange tower) having 3 distinct vertical layers\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- The left structure has 4 red arch blocks (2 on top, 2 on bottom) with a yellow horizontal bar connecting them in the middle\n- The right structure has 2 red arch blocks on the bottom, with green rectangular blocks on top of them, then yellow rectangular blocks, and finally an orange cylindrical tower with an orange triangular roof\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch blocks (indexes 1 and 2) - Used for the base structures\n2. Green rectangular blocks (indexes 7 and 9) - Used in the middle layer of the right structure\n3. Yellow rectangular blocks (indexes 10 and 11) - Used for the horizontal connections and top layer\n4. Orange cylindrical block (index 12) - Used for the tower\n5. Orange triangular roof piece (one of indexes 14, 15, or 16) - Used for the top of the tower\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 11\n    Step12: Move block with index 12\n    Step13: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order places the base blocks first, then the connecting elements, and finally the tower components, building the structure from the bottom up. I've selected the triangular roof piece that appears to best match the orientation in the target image (index 15).",

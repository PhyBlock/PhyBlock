Let me analyze this in detail:\n\n### Count & Layers:\n- The structure appears to have 9 total blocks\n- It has 2 layers:\n  - Bottom layer: 4 orange triangular/wedge blocks\n  - Top layer: 4 blue rectangular/cubic blocks surrounding 1 green square block in the center\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- The green square block (index 2) is positioned in the center of the top layer\n- Four blue blocks form a T-shape pattern around the green block\n- Four orange triangular/wedge blocks are positioned on the outside edges of the structure, pointing outward from the center\n- The orange triangular blocks are arranged in a symmetrical pattern, forming what looks like a cross or X shape from above\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need to select the following blocks:\n\n1. Green cube (index 2) - 1 piece for the center top\n2. Blue cubic blocks (index 1) - 4 pieces arranged in a T-shape around the green cube\n3. Orange triangular/wedge blocks (indices 11, 12, 13, 16) - 4 pieces for the outer edges\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nThe logical assembly order would be to start with the bottom layer of triangular blocks and then add the top layer of cubes:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 16 \n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order places the four orange triangular blocks first to form the base, then adds the four blue cubes in a T-shape formation, and finally places the green cube in the center of the top layer to complete the structure.",

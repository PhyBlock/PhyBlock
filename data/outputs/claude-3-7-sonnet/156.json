Red block with two arches (Block index 2)\n2. Red block with one arch (Block index 1) and a green rectangular block (Block index 6)\n3. Red block with arch (Block index 3)\n4. Two green vertical rectangular blocks (Block index 7 twice)\n5. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (Block index 9) and orange triangular block (Block index 13)\n\n### Right Stack (from bottom to top):\n1. Red block with large circular hole (Block index 4)\n2. Green rectangular block (Block index 6)\n3. Yellow semi-circular block (Block index 10)\n4. Red block with arch (Block index 3)\n\n# Assembly Instructions\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 13\n   Step9: Move block with index 4\n   Step10: Move block with index 6\n   Step11: Move block with index 10\n   Step12: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly order starts from the bottom of the left structure and builds upward, then moves to the right structure and builds it from bottom to top, following a logical building sequence where lower supports are placed before upper elements.",

Left Structure (Tower-like):\n   - 7 blocks total: 4 orange cylinders, 1 yellow rectangular block, 1 yellow semicircular top, and 1 orange triangular roof\n   - 3 layers: cylinders at the bottom, yellow rectangular block in the middle, and semicircular top with triangular roof on top\n\n2. Right Structure (Wall-like):\n   - 6 blocks total: 2 red arch blocks and 4 green rectangular blocks\n   - 1 layer arrangement: red arch blocks forming a base with green blocks standing vertically behind them\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- Left Structure: Four orange cylinders arranged in a square pattern support a horizontal yellow rectangular block. On top of this yellow block is another orange cylinder with a yellow semicircular cap. An orange triangular block leans against the upper cylinder.\n- Right Structure: Two red arch blocks are positioned side by side horizontally, with four green rectangular blocks standing vertically in a row behind them.\n- The two structures are positioned near each other but are not connected.\n\n# Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nFor the Left Structure:\n- 4 × Block 8 (orange vertical cylinder) for the support columns\n- 1 × Block 7 (yellow horizontal rectangular block) for the middle platform\n- 1 × Block 8 (orange vertical cylinder) for the top column\n- 1 × Block 10 (yellow semicircular cap) for the top of the structure\n- 1 × Block 16 (orange triangular block) for the roof piece\n\nFor the Right Structure:\n- 1 × Block 1 (red arch block, left orientation)\n- 1 × Block 2 (red arch block, right orientation) \n- 4 × Block 6 (green vertical rectangular block) for the wall\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 16\n   Step9: Move block with index 1\n   Step10: Move block with index 2\n   Step11: Move block with index 6\n   Step12: Move block with index 6\n   Step13: Move block with index 6\n   Step14: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first builds the tower-like structure on the left (steps 1-8) and then constructs the wall-like structure on the right (steps 9-14).",

The red cube sits directly on top of the green rectangle, and the blue cube is stacked on top of the red cube.\n- In the secondary structure, the blue cube is flanked by orange triangular/wedge pieces on two sides.\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\nFor the Main Structure:\n- Blue cube (index 1)\n- Red cube (index 2)\n- Green horizontal rectangle (index 4 or 7) - looks like index 4 is the right orientation\n- Two orange cylinders (index 8 or 9) - index 9 appears to be the correct horizontal orientation\n\nFor the Secondary Structure:\n- Blue cube (index 1)\n- Two orange triangular/wedge pieces (indices 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16) - looks like indices 13 and 15 match the orientation needed\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 13\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence first builds the main tower structure (steps 1-5) by placing the cylindrical base, then the rectangular green block, followed by the red cube and blue cube. Then it creates the secondary structure (steps 6-8) using another blue cube and two triangular orange pieces.",

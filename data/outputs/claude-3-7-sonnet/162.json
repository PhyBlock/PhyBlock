      "text": "## Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure consists of multiple components arranged in what appears to be a tower and a vehicle-like structure. The structure uses a total of 15 blocks organized in multiple layers.\n\n### Primary Components:\n1. **Left Tower Structure:**\n   - Top: Orange triangular roof (wedge shape)\n   - Second layer: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n   - Middle section: Two green rectangular blocks (vertical)\n   - Another yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n   - Bottom section: Two orange cylindrical blocks\n   - Base: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n\n2. **Right Structure (vehicle-like):**\n   - Small blue cube with orange triangular roof\n   - Yellow rectangular block extending horizontally\n   - Two orange cylindrical blocks as \"wheels\"\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- The tower structure is built vertically with alternating layers\n- The vehicle structure has a small house on top of a platform supported by cylindrical blocks\n\n## Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n1. Block #1 - Blue cube (for the small house)\n2. Block #8 - Orange cylindrical block (used 4 times for the tower base and vehicle wheels)\n3. Block #3 - Green vertical rectangular block (used 2 times in the middle of the tower)\n4. Block #5 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (used 1 time for the tower's top platform)\n5. Block #6 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (used 1 time for the tower's middle platform)\n6. Block #7 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (used 1 time for the tower's base and 1 time for the vehicle platform)\n7. Block #13 - Orange triangular roof/wedge (used 2 times - one for the tower top and one for the small house)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 3\n   Step6: Move block with index 3\n   Step7: Move block with index 5\n   Step8: Move block with index 13\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 8\n   Step11: Move block with index 8\n   Step12: Move block with index 7\n   Step13: Move block with index 1\n   Step14: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the tower structure from bottom to top first, then constructs the vehicle structure.",

Bottom Layer: An orange cylindrical block with two circular ends (appears to be a cylinder with wheels)\n2. Second Layer: A green rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinder\n3. Third Layer: A red cube placed on the right side of the green block\n4. Fourth Layer: A blue cube placed directly on top of the red cube\n\nThe structure has 4 layers total, with blocks arranged to create a simple vehicle-like shape with the orange cylinder serving as the base/wheels.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nLooking at the block dictionary, I need to identify the exact blocks that match those in the target structure:\n\n1. For the blue cube on top: Block index 1\n2. For the red cube in the third layer: Block index 4\n3. For the green rectangular block in the second layer: Block index 6\n4. For the orange cylindrical base: Block index 14\n\nThe green rectangular block is placed horizontally, so I need to use block #6 rather than blocks #7, #8, #9, #10, or #11 which show green blocks in different orientations.\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nTo construct this structure from bottom to top:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 14\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence follows a logical building order from the ground up, starting with the wheeled base, then adding the green platform, followed by the red cube, and finally placing the blue cube on top.",

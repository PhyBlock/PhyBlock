Main Structure (from bottom to top):\n   - Bottom layer: Two red arch blocks side by side\n   - Middle layer: One yellow rectangular block placed horizontally across the two red arch blocks\n   - Top layer: \n     - One red arch block with an orange triangular roof on top\n     - One green cube and one blue cube placed next to each other on the yellow rectangular block\n\n2. Separate Structure:\n   - A single red arch block with an orange triangular roof, positioned to the left of the main structure\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, these are the blocks needed from the block dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch blocks (block index 1): 3 instances\n2. Yellow rectangular horizontal block (block index 8): 1 instance\n3. Green cube (block index 5): 1 instance\n4. Blue cube (block index 4): 1 instance\n5. Orange triangular roof (block index 14): 2 instances\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 14\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 4\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 14\n}\n```",

The structure appears to be a kind of bridge or construction with:\n- Red arch blocks forming supports\n- Yellow rectangular blocks forming bridges/platforms\n- Green cubic blocks\n- Blue rectangular blocks\n- Orange triangular/sloped blocks\n- The structure has 3 main layers in most sections\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\nThe structure can be divided into two main parts:\n1. Left side: An arch-like structure made of red blocks with yellow blocks on top\n2. Right side: A house-like structure with green, blue, and orange blocks\n\nThe left structure has red arch blocks on the bottom supporting yellow rectangular blocks. The right structure has a yellow base with green blocks, blue blocks, and an orange triangular roof.\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n- Block 1: Red arch block (used multiple times for support)\n- Block 2: Red arch block (used at least once)\n- Block 3: Red arch block with different orientation (used at least once)\n- Block 4: Red arch block (used at least once)\n- Block 5: Green cube (used multiple times)\n- Block 6: Blue cube (used once)\n- Block 7: Blue rectangle vertical (used once)\n- Block 8: Blue rectangle vertical (used once)\n- Block 9: Yellow rectangular block (used for platforms)\n- Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (used for platforms)\n- Block 11: Yellow rectangular block (used for platforms)\n- Block 14: Red cube (used for top of left structure)\n- Block 15: Orange triangular/sloped block (used for roof)\n- Block 16: Orange triangular/sloped block (used for roof)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 10\n   Step7: Move block with index 11\n   Step8: Move block with index 14\n   Step9: Move block with index 14\n   Step10: Move block with index 9\n   Step11: Move block with index 10\n   Step12: Move block with index 5\n   Step13: Move block with index 5\n   Step14: Move block with index 6\n   Step15: Move block with index 7\n   Step16: Move block with index 8\n   Step17: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from the ground up, starting with the support arches, then the connecting platforms, followed by the blocks that form the structures on top of the platforms, and finally the roof elements.",

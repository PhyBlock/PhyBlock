Here's a detailed description:\n\n### Count & Layers:\n- The structure has approximately 17 blocks in total\n- There are 4 distinct layers in the structure\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n1. **Bottom Layer**: Orange cylindrical pillars (4 of them) arranged in a rectangular formation\n2. **Second Layer**: Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks on the right (3 blocks) and red arch-shaped blocks on the left (3 blocks) creating a bridge-like structure\n3. **Third Layer**: Green cube blocks (4 blocks) stacked in a row on the left side\n4. **Fourth Layer/Tower**: A blue cube block stacked on a green cube block, topped with a yellow curved/dome-shaped block\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\n- Block #11 (Orange cylinder): Need 4 of these for the base pillars\n- Block #8 and #9 (Yellow horizontal rectangles): Need 3 of these for the platform\n- Block #1, #2, #3 (Red arch blocks): Need 3 of these for the bridge section\n- Block #5 (Green cube): Need 5 of these (4 in a row and 1 for the tower)\n- Block #4 (Blue cube): Need 1 of this for the tower\n- Block #12 (Yellow dome): Need 1 of this for the top of the tower\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 11\n  Step2: Move block with index 11\n  Step3: Move block with index 11\n  Step4: Move block with index 11\n  Step5: Move block with index 8\n  Step6: Move block with index 9\n  Step7: Move block with index 8\n  Step8: Move block with index 1\n  Step9: Move block with index 2\n  Step10: Move block with index 3\n  Step11: Move block with index 5\n  Step12: Move block with index 5\n  Step13: Move block with index 5\n  Step14: Move block with index 5\n  Step15: Move block with index 5\n  Step16: Move block with index 4\n  Step17: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the foundation (pillars), then builds the platform and bridge structure, followed by the green blocks, and finally adds the tower with the blue block and yellow dome on top.",

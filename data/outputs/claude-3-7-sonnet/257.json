Train Engine:\n   - Block index 15: Orange triangular roof\n   - Block index 6: Blue cube\n   - Block index 10: Yellow rectangular block\n   - Block index 12: Orange cylinder (used twice)\n\n2. Train Cars/Wagon:\n   - Block index 1: Red arch block (used twice for bottom row)\n   - Block index 3: Red arch block (used twice for top row)\n   - Block index 10: Yellow rectangular block (used once for the top connecting piece)\n   - Block index 9: Yellow rectangular block (used twice for the inner pieces visible through arches)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 3\n    Step9: Move block with index 3\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 9\n    Step12: Move block with index 10\n}\n```",

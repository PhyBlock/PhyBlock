Yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal) - Block index 8 (appears 3 times)\n2. Red cube with circular hole - Block index 3\n3. Orange cylindrical pillars (vertical) - Block index 9 (appears 2 times)\n4. Orange triangular pyramid - Block index 16\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 9\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly proceeds from bottom to top, starting with the base yellow rectangular block, then adding the red block with a hole, followed by another yellow rectangular block that supports the two orange cylinders, and finally adding the top yellow rectangular block and the orange triangular pyramid.",

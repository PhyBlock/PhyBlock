Red arch block (#1) - used twice\n2. Red arch block (#2) - used once\n3. Red curved block with semicircular cutouts (#3) - used once\n4. Blue cubic block (#5) - used once\n5. Green rectangular block horizontal (#7) - used once\n6. Green rectangular block horizontal (#8) - used once\n7. Orange/red cylindrical block (#12) - used once\n8. Orange cubic block (#13) - used as part of house/tower\n9. Orange triangular roof (#14) - used once\n10. Orange triangular roof (#15) - used once\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 14\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 2\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 8\n   Step11: Move block with index 11\n   Step12: Move block with index 12\n   Step13: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order follows a bottom-up approach for each structure, starting with the left tower-like structure and then building the right house-like structure.",

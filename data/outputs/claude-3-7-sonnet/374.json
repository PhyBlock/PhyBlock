A larger structure on the left that resembles a stylized factory or train with:\n   - 2 tall yellow rectangular towers/smokestacks\n   - 2 green rectangular blocks\n   - 2 yellow semi-cylindrical blocks\n   - 1 red arch block with two openings\n\n2. A smaller house-like structure on the right with:\n   - 1 blue cube as the main house body\n   - 1 orange/red triangular roof\n   - 1 green horizontal rectangular block\n   - 1 red arch block with one opening\n\nTotal block count: 10 blocks\nLayers: The structures have 2-3 layers of blocks vertically arranged.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\nLeft Structure (Factory/Train):\n- Two tall yellow rectangular blocks (towers) are positioned at the back\n- Two green rectangular blocks are positioned between the yellow towers\n- A red arch block with two openings is at the front bottom\n- Two yellow semi-cylindrical blocks are placed on top of the red arch block\n\nRight Structure (House):\n- A red arch block with one opening forms the base\n- A green horizontal rectangular block is placed on top of the red arch\n- A blue cube sits on top of the green block\n- An orange/red triangular roof tops the blue cube\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Left Structure:\n   - Block 1 (red arch with one opening) - used once\n   - Block 2 (red arch with one opening) - used once\n   - Block 7 (tall green rectangular block) - used once\n   - Block 8 (tall green rectangular block) - used once\n   - Block 11 (tall yellow rectangular block) - used twice\n   - Block 12 (yellow semi-cylindrical block) - used twice\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - Block 2 (red arch with one opening) - used once\n   - Block 3 (blue cube) - used once\n   - Block 6 (green horizontal rectangular block) - used once\n   - Block 15 (orange triangular roof) - used once\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 15\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 2\n   Step7: Move block with index 12\n   Step8: Move block with index 12\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 8\n   Step11: Move block with index 11\n   Step12: Move block with index 11\n}\n```",

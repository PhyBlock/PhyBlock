Block index 1: Red arch block (serves as the main doorway)\n2. Block index 6: Green vertical rectangular block (x2, positioned on sides)\n3. Block index 7: Green horizontal rectangular block (positioned on left side)\n4. Block index 9: Orange cylinder (x2, supporting the arch)\n5. Block index 13: Orange triangular wedge (positioned on left)\n6. Block index 14: Orange triangular wedge (x2, positioned on right and for the roof)\n7. Block index 16: Orange triangular wedge (positioned on right)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the base cylindrical columns, adds the green rectangular blocks for stability, positions the triangular wedges around the base, places the red arch on top of the cylinders, and finally adds the triangular roof piece.",

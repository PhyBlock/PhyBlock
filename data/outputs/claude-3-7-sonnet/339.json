The structure uses approximately 12 distinct building blocks arranged in several layers and groupings.\n\n## Spatial Relationships Description\nThe overall structure can be divided into two main sections:\n\n1. **Left Section (Buildings):**\n   - A red arch block at the bottom\n   - A green rectangular block on top of the red arch\n   - A blue cube on top of the green block\n   - An orange triangular roof on top of the blue cube\n   - Next to this tower is an orange cylindrical tower with an orange triangular roof\n\n2. **Right Section (Vehicle/Machine):**\n   - Two orange horizontal cylindrical blocks as the base/wheels\n   - A yellow rectangular block placed horizontally across the cylinders\n   - A blue cube on top of the yellow rectangle\n   - A yellow half-cylindrical block at the end of the yellow rectangle\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch block (index 1)\n2. Green rectangular block (index 7)\n3. Blue cube (index 4) - needed twice\n4. Orange cylindrical block (index 9) - used for vertical tower\n5. Orange horizontal cylindrical blocks (index 10) - needed twice for the vehicle base\n6. Yellow rectangular block (index 8)\n7. Yellow half-cylindrical block (index 12)\n8. Orange triangular roof (index 14) - needed twice\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 14\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 14\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n   Step9: Move block with index 8\n   Step10: Move block with index 12\n   Step11: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the left tower (red arch base, green block, blue cube, orange roof), then adds the cylindrical tower with its roof, followed by the vehicle components (orange cylinders as wheels, yellow rectangular body, yellow curved top, and blue cube on top).",

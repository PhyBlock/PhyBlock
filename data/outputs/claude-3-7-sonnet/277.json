Structure 1 (Left): A red cube with a circular hole through it.\n   - It consists of two red blocks stacked vertically\n   - Each block has a semi-circular cutout that forms a complete circular hole when stacked\n\n2. Structure 2 (Right): A house-like structure consisting of:\n   - Bottom layer: Two blue rectangular blocks side by side\n   - Middle layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block placed across the blue blocks\n   - Top layer: A red arch-like structure with a circular hole/tunnel\n   - Roof: An orange triangular prism forming a roof shape\n\nIn total, there are 7 blocks used in both structures combined.\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the main target image, I need the following blocks:\n\nFor Structure 1 (Red cube with hole):\n- Two instances of block index 1 (red block with semi-circular cutout)\n\nFor Structure 2 (House):\n- Two instances of block index 5 (blue rectangular block)\n- One instance of block index 6 (yellow horizontal rectangular block)\n- One instance of block index 1 (red block with semi-circular cutout)\n- One instance of block index 13 (orange triangular prism for the roof)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order places the blue blocks first as the foundation of the house structure, followed by the yellow block on top, then the red arch block, and finally the orange roof. The last step adds the second red block to create the separate red cube with hole structure.",

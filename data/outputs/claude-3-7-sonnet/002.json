I need 4 of these for the base.\n2. **Green Rectangles**: The horizontal green rectangular blocks shown at indices 1 and 2 appear very similar. Based on the main image, I'll use index 1 for both top blocks as they match the orientation needed.\n\n**List of Block Indices Required**:\n- 4× Index 7 (vertical orange cylinders)\n- 2× Index 1 (horizontal green rectangles)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n}\n\nThis assembly order places the four vertical cylinders first to create the base structure, and then places the two green rectangular blocks side by side on top to complete the structure.",

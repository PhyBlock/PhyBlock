Block #1 - Red arch block with semicircular cutout (left side of bottom layer)\n2. Block #2 - Red arch block with semicircular cutout (right side of bottom layer)\n3. Block #6 - Red arch block with semicircular cutout (top layer)\n4. Block #8 - Yellow rectangular block (left side of middle layer)\n5. Block #9 - Yellow rectangular block (right side of middle layer)\n6. Block #14 - Orange triangular block (left side of roof)\n7. Block #15 - Orange triangular block (right side of roof)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly proceeds from bottom to top, starting with the foundation arch blocks, then the yellow rectangular blocks for the middle layer, followed by the top red arch block, and finally the two orange triangular roof pieces.",

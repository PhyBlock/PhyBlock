Block #1: Red arch block (for the base)\n2. Block #8: Green horizontal rectangular block (for the middle layer)\n3. Block #6: Blue cube (for the upper section)\n4. Block #11: Orange/red triangular roof piece (for the top)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis order follows a bottom-to-top construction approach, starting with the base and building upward, which is the most logical way to assemble this structure.",

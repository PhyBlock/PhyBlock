Block #1 - Red block with arch (bottom layer)\n2. Block #10 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (middle connector)\n3. Block #5 - Red block with half-circular cutout (left side of middle layer)\n4. Block #6 - Red block with half-circular cutout (right side of middle layer)\n5. Block #9 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (top layer)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts from the bottom and works upward, creating a stable structure where each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.",

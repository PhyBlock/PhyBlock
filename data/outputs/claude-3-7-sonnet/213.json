A tower-like structure on the right with what appears to be a small house\n\n## Block Count and Layers\nThe structure consists of approximately 17-18 total blocks divided as follows:\n\n### Left Structure (Vehicle/Train):\n- Bottom layer: 2 orange cylindrical wheels (horizontal)\n- Middle layer: 1 yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n- Top layer: 3 blocks (green rectangular block, blue cube, red block with yellow semi-cylindrical roof)\n\n### Right Structure (Tower):\n- Base: 2 orange cylindrical pillars (vertical)\n- Second layer: 1 yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n- Third layer: Red house-like structure with an arch doorway and yellow semi-cylindrical roof section\n- Vertical element: 1 tall orange cylindrical column\n- Top: 1 orange triangular pyramid\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The left structure resembles a small train or vehicle with wheels at the bottom\n- The right structure is taller with vertical supports and what looks like a small house with a doorway\n- The tall orange column rises from behind the house structure to support the triangular roof piece\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on the main image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. For the left structure (train):\n   - Two orange horizontal cylinders (index 9) for wheels\n   - One yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 7) for base\n   - One green rectangular block (index 5)\n   - One blue cube (index 2)\n   - One red block with arch (index 1)\n   - One yellow semi-cylindrical roof (index 10)\n\n2. For the right structure (tower):\n   - Two orange vertical cylinders (index 8) for pillars\n   - One yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 7) for support\n   - One red block with arch (index 1) for house structure\n   - One yellow semi-cylindrical roof (index 10)\n   - One tall orange vertical cylinder (index 8) for column\n   - One orange triangular pyramid (index 13 or 14 or 15 or 16, depending on orientation - appears to be index 13)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9 (orange horizontal cylinder for left wheel)\n   Step2: Move block with index 9 (orange horizontal cylinder for right wheel)\n   Step3: Move block with index 7 (yellow horizontal block for train base)\n   Step4: Move block with index 5 (green rectangular block for train)\n   Step5: Move block with index 2 (blue cube for train)\n   Step6: Move block with index 1 (red arch block for train)\n   Step7: Move block with index 10 (yellow semi-cylindrical roof for train)\n   Step8: Move block with index 8 (orange vertical cylinder for left tower pillar)\n   Step9: Move block with index 8 (orange vertical cylinder for right tower pillar)\n   Step10: Move block with index 7 (yellow horizontal block for tower support)\n   Step11: Move block with index 1 (red arch block for tower house)\n   Step12: Move block with index 10 (yellow semi-cylindrical roof for tower house)\n   Step13: Move block with index 8 (orange vertical cylinder for tall column)\n   Step14: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular pyramid for top)\n}\n```",

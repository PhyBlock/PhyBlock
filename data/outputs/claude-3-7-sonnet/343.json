Base: Two orange cylindrical pillars\n2. Middle: Yellow rectangular blocks with red and blue cubes\n3. Top: A tall orange cylindrical piece with an orange triangular roof\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- Two orange cylindrical pillars (index 12) form the base of the main structure\n- A long orange cylindrical piece (index 12) extends vertically from the left pillar\n- Yellow rectangular blocks (indices 10 and 11) are placed horizontally across the pillars\n- A red cube (index 1) sits on the left yellow rectangular block\n- A blue cube (index 6) sits on the right yellow rectangular block\n- An orange triangular piece (index 15) sits atop the tall orange cylinder\n\nThe separate structure on the left consists of:\n- A blue cube (index 6) at the bottom left\n- A red cube (index 1) in the middle\n- A green cube (index 7) at the right\n- A yellow rectangular block (index 11) placed horizontally on top\n- An orange triangular piece (index 15) sits on the yellow rectangular block\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n- Orange cylindrical blocks (index 12) - used 3 times\n- Yellow rectangular blocks (index 10 and 11) - used 4 times\n- Red cubic blocks (index 1) - used 2 times\n- Blue cubic blocks (index 6) - used 2 times\n- Green cubic block (index 7) - used 1 time\n- Orange triangular pieces (index 15) - used 2 times\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 12\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n   Step10: Move block with index 1\n   Step11: Move block with index 7\n   Step12: Move block with index 11\n   Step13: Move block with index 15\n}\n```",

A blue cubic block (Block index 1) - for the cabin/body\n2. A yellow horizontal rectangular block (Block index 6) - for the main body/platform \n3. Two orange cylindrical blocks (Block index 8) - for the wheels\n4. An orange triangular roof piece (Block index 13) - for the roof of the cabin\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence places the wheels first, then the main body platform, followed by the cabin block, and finally the roof piece to complete the structure.",

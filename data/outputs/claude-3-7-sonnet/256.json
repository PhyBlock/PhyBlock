Red arch blocks (indices 1, 2) - Used for the base arches\n2. Red circular hole blocks (indices 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) - Used for the tower walls\n3. Blue cube (index 8) - Used in the right section\n4. Green cube (index 9) - Used in the right section\n5. Red cube (index 10) - Used in the right section\n6. Yellow cube (index 11) - Used at the right end\n7. Yellow rectangular blocks (indices 12, 13, 15, 16) - Used as horizontal supports and top pieces\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n   Step6: Move block with index 3\n   Step7: Move block with index 4\n   Step8: Move block with index 7\n   Step9: Move block with index 12\n   Step10: Move block with index 1\n   Step11: Move block with index 2\n   Step12: Move block with index 9\n   Step13: Move block with index 10\n   Step14: Move block with index 8\n   Step15: Move block with index 11\n   Step16: Move block with index 16\n   Step17: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from the ground up, starting with the arch base, adding the tower components, then extending to the right section with the colored cubes and finishing with the yellow blocks on the right end.",

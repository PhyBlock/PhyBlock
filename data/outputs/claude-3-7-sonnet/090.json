For the four orange cylindrical legs: Block index 10 (vertical orange cylinder) x4\n2. For the tabletop: Block index 6 (horizontal yellow rectangular block) x2\n3. For the vertical post: Block index 2 (vertical green rectangular block) x1\n4. For the top piece: Block index 12 (yellow curved/semi-cylindrical block) x1\n\n**List of Required Blocks by Index**: 10, 10, 10, 10, 6, 6, 2, 12\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nFor a stable construction, I'll start with the base pillars, then add the tabletop, then the vertical post, and finally the top piece:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, ensuring stability at each step.",

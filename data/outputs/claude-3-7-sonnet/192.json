Orange cylindrical pillars: Block #12 (needed 4 times)\n2. Yellow rectangular horizontal blocks: Block #8 and #11 (needed 3 times)\n3. Green rectangular blocks: Block #5, #6, and #7 (needed 3 times)\n4. Yellow half-cylinder blocks: Block #13 (needed 3 times)\n5. Blue cube: Block #3 (needed 1 time)\n6. Red block with semicircular cutout: Block #2 (needed 1 time)\n7. Orange triangular blocks: Block #16 (needed 1 time)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\nFor Structure 1 (Left):\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nFor Structure 2 (Right):\n```\n{\n    Step9: Move block with index 3\n    Step10: Move block with index 7\n    Step11: Move block with index 13\n    Step12: Move block with index 13\n    Step13: Move block with index 11\n    Step14: Move block with index 2\n    Step15: Move block with index 5\n    Step16: Move block with index 16\n}\n```",

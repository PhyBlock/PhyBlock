Red arch blocks (Block #1 and #2) - need 3 total (1 for left structure, 2 for right structure)\n2. Blue cube (Block #3) - need 1 for left structure\n3. Orange triangular roof piece (Block #15) - need 1 for top of left structure\n4. Green rectangular block (Block #6) - need 1 for middle of left structure\n5. Yellow rectangular blocks (Block #7 and #9) - need 3 total for middle of right structure\n6. Orange cylindrical pillars (Block #10) - need 3 for left structure\n7. Red rectangular blocks - need 2 for top of right structure (these appear to be Block #1 without the arch visible)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\nFor the left structure:\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 10\nStep3: Move block with index 10\nStep4: Move block with index 10\nStep5: Move block with index 6\nStep6: Move block with index 3\nStep7: Move block with index 15\n```\n\nFor the right structure:\n```\nStep8: Move block with index 1\nStep9: Move block with index 2\nStep10: Move block with index 7\nStep11: Move block with index 9\nStep12: Move block with index 9\nStep13: Move block with index 1\nStep14: Move block with index 1\n```",

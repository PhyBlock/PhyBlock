Left Construction:\n   - Contains 8 blocks: 3 green rectangular blocks, 2 orange cylinders, and 3 orange triangular/wedge-shaped blocks\n   - Has multiple layers with some blocks stacked on top of others\n\n2. Right Construction:\n   - Contains 3 blocks: 2 green cubic blocks, 1 blue cubic block, and 1 red block with a semi-circular cutout\n   - Has a distinct stacked arrangement with 3 layers\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Left Construction:\n- Two vertical green rectangular blocks (#5) standing side by side\n- Two orange vertical cylinders (#7) positioned between the green blocks\n- A triangular orange roof-like structure (#12) at the top of the cylinders\n- Two orange wedge/ramp blocks (#13, #15) placed at the base on either side of the structure\n\n### Right Construction:\n- Bottom layer: A blue cubic block (#2) and a green cubic block (#3) side by side\n- Middle layer: A green rectangular block (#4) placed horizontally on top of both cubes\n- Top layer: A red block with a semi-circular cutout (#1) placed on top\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks are required:\n\n1. Block #1: Red block with semi-circular cutout\n2. Block #2: Blue cubic block\n3. Block #3: Green cubic block (used twice)\n4. Block #4: Green horizontal rectangular block\n5. Block #5: Green vertical rectangular block (used twice)\n6. Block #7: Orange vertical cylinder (used twice)\n7. Block #12: Orange triangular/wedge block pointing upward\n8. Block #13: Orange triangular/wedge block pointing right\n9. Block #15: Orange triangular/wedge block pointing left\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 12\n   Step8: Move block with index 13\n   Step9: Move block with index 15\n   Step10: Move block with index 2\n   Step11: Move block with index 3\n   Step12: Move block with index 4\n   Step13: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order places the left construction first (the house-like structure with green blocks, cylinders and orange triangular pieces), followed by the right construction (the stacked blocks with the red semi-circular cutout piece on top).",

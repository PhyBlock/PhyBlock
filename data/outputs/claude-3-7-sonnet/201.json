A smaller structure (left side) consisting of 4 blocks: 2 orange/red cubes, 1 green rectangular piece, and 1 orange triangular roof piece.\n2. A larger structure (right side) resembling a frame or doorway on a base, consisting of 8 blocks: 2 vertical green rectangular pieces, 2 horizontal yellow rectangular pieces, 1 green base, 1 orange cylindrical piece, and 2 orange triangular pieces.\n\nIn total, there are 12 blocks used across both structures.\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n### For the smaller structure (left):\n- Base layer: Two blocks - one red cube and one orange cube side by side\n- Middle layer: One green rectangular piece placed horizontally across the two cubes\n- Top layer: One orange triangular piece (roof-shaped) on top of the green piece\n\n### For the larger structure (right):\n- Base: A green rectangular piece horizontally on the ground\n- Support: An orange cylindrical piece standing vertically on the green base\n- Frame: Two vertical green rectangular pieces with two horizontal yellow rectangular pieces connecting them at the top and bottom, forming a frame/doorway\n- Inside the frame: Two orange triangular pieces (one on the bottom yellow piece)\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\nFor the smaller structure:\n- Block 3 (red cube)\n- Block 2 (orange cube)\n- Block 4 (green horizontal rectangular piece)\n- Block 16 (orange triangular piece)\n\nFor the larger structure:\n- Block 7 (green horizontal rectangular piece for base)\n- Block 12 (orange cylinder)\n- Block 5 and Block 6 (green vertical rectangular pieces for the frame sides)\n- Block 8 and Block 11 (yellow horizontal rectangular pieces for top and bottom of frame)\n- Block 15 (orange triangular piece inside frame)\n- Block 16 (another orange triangular piece inside frame)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 15\n   Step8: Move block with index 16\n   Step9: Move block with index 3\n   Step10: Move block with index 2\n   Step11: Move block with index 4\n   Step12: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nNote: I've ordered the assembly starting with the larger structure (steps 1-8) and then the smaller structure (steps 9-12). For step 12, I'm using block 16 again as it appears to be the same triangular piece used in both structures.",

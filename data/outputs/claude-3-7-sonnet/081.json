Middle-lower layer: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n3. Middle-upper layer: Two orange cylindrical pillars\n4. Top layer: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation) with an orange triangular roof\n\nThe spatial arrangement shows:\n- The arched block serves as the base\n- A horizontal yellow rectangular block rests on top of the arched block\n- Two orange cylindrical pillars stand upright on the first yellow block\n- A second yellow horizontal rectangular block sits on top of the cylinders\n- An orange triangular roof block sits on top of the upper yellow block\n\n## Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need these blocks:\n1. Red/orange arched block - matches index 2 (arch facing forward)\n2. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (2 needed) - match index 6\n3. Orange cylindrical pillars (2 needed) - match index 9\n4. Orange triangular roof - matches index 13\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 9\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 13\n}\n\nThe assembly starts from the bottom, building up layer by layer, with the two identical cylindrical pillars positioned side by side in steps 3 and 4.",

Block 1 - Red block with single arch cutout\n2. Block 2 - Red block with single arch cutout (different orientation)\n3. Block 3 - Red L-shaped block with semi-circular cutouts\n4. Block 5 - Red block with circular hole\n5. Block 6 - Blue cube\n6. Block 7 - Green horizontal rectangular block\n7. Block 11 - Yellow long horizontal block\n8. Block 12 - Yellow long horizontal block (appears identical to 11)\n9. Block 16 - Orange triangular roof piece\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 16\n   Step7: Move block with index 11\n   Step8: Move block with index 5\n   Step9: Move block with index 12\n   Step10: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts from the base, builds the left structure first, then constructs the right structure from bottom to top.",

The structure has the following characteristics:\n\n- Total blocks: 7 blocks (3 green rectangular blocks and 4 orange triangular/trapezoidal blocks)\n- Layers: The structure has 2 main layers\n- Spatial arrangement: \n  - Base layer: Three green rectangular blocks positioned vertically to form walls, with an orange cylindrical block in the center\n  - Top layer: Four orange triangular/trapezoidal blocks forming roof-like elements (one on top, three around the sides)\n\n## Identification of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nLooking at the block dictionary, I can identify the following blocks needed:\n\n1. Green rectangular vertical blocks (walls): Block indices 3, 3, and 4\n2. Orange cylindrical block (center column): Block index 6\n3. Orange triangular/trapezoidal blocks (roof elements): Block indices 12, 14, 15, and 16\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on the structure shown, here is the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 3\n  Step2: Move block with index 6\n  Step3: Move block with index 3\n  Step4: Move block with index 4\n  Step5: Move block with index 12\n  Step6: Move block with index 14\n  Step7: Move block with index 16\n  Step8: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order places the vertical green blocks first to form the walls, positions the orange cylindrical block in the center, and then places the triangular roof elements to complete the structure.",

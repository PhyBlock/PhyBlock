Bottom: Yellow horizontal beam\n2. Middle-bottom: Red arch/tunnel piece\n3. Middle-top: Two orange cylindrical pillars with a yellow horizontal beam\n4. Top: Orange triangular/wedge piece\n- Colors used: Yellow, Red, and Orange\n- All components are arranged symmetrically\n\nRequired blocks from the dictionary and assembly order:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7 (bottom yellow horizontal beam)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (left half of red arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 2 (right half of red arch)\n    Step4: Move block with index 7 (middle yellow horizontal beam)\n    Step5: Move block with index 11 (left orange cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 11 (right orange cylinder)\n    Step7: Move block with index 7 (top yellow horizontal beam)\n    Step8: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular top piece)\n}\n\nThe structure is built from bottom to top, ensuring stability. The red arch is made by combining two matching curved pieces, and the pillars are identical cylindrical blocks. The top triangular piece provides a decorative finish to the structure.",

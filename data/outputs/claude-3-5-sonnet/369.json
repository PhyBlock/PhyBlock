Left Structure: A red arch-like construction with two blue cubes\n2. Right Structure: Two orange cylindrical pillars with yellow rectangular blocks on top\n\nBlock Count and Layers:\nLeft Structure:\n- 2 red arch pieces\n- 2 blue cubes\nRight Structure:\n- 2 orange cylindrical pillars\n- 2 yellow rectangular blocks\nTotal: 8 blocks\n\nFrom the Block Dictionary, I can identify the following needed blocks:\n- Block 1: Red arch piece\n- Block 2: Red arch piece\n- Block 3: Blue cube (needed twice)\n- Block 8: Orange cylindrical pillar (needed twice)\n- Block 5 & 6: Yellow rectangular blocks\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 (bottom red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (top red arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 3 (first blue cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 3 (second blue cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 8 (first orange pillar)\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (second orange pillar)\n    Step7: Move block with index 5 (first yellow rectangle)\n    Step8: Move block with index 6 (second yellow rectangle)\n}\n\nThe blocks must be assembled from bottom to top, ensuring stability. The left structure's arch pieces create a frame for the blue cubes, while the right structure's pillars support the yellow rectangular blocks that are placed perpendicular to each other.",

Left Structure:\n- A small construction with triangular blocks\n- Has a blue cube in the center\n- Green rectangular block on top\n- Orange triangular blocks on sides\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- A larger table-like construction\n- Four orange cylindrical pillars as legs\n- Two yellow rectangular blocks on top forming the table surface\n- A tower on top consisting of (bottom to top):\n  * Green cube\n  * Blue cube\n  * Yellow curved block (arch)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n\nFor the Left Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 (blue cube - center)\nStep2: Move block with index 13 (orange triangle - left side)\nStep3: Move block with index 15 (orange triangle - right side)\nStep4: Move block with index 4 (green rectangular block - top)\n}\n\nFor the Right Structure:\n{\nStep5: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder - back left leg)\nStep6: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder - back right leg)\nStep7: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder - front left leg)\nStep8: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder - front right leg)\nStep9: Move block with index 5 (yellow rectangle - left table top)\nStep10: Move block with index 7 (yellow rectangle - right table top)\nStep11: Move block with index 2 (green cube - first tower block)\nStep12: Move block with index 1 (blue cube - second tower block)\nStep13: Move block with index 9 (yellow arch - tower top)\n}\n\nThe blocks are carefully selected to match the exact orientation shown in the dictionary image, with no rotations needed.",

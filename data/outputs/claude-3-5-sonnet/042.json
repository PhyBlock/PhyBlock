Red block with semi-circular cutout (bottom)\n  2. Green rectangular block\n  3. Yellow cylindrical/curved blocks\n  4. Green rectangular block\n  5. Red block with semi-circular cutout (top)\n\nStep-by-Step Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6 (bottom red block with cutout)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 12 (first yellow curved piece)\n    Step4: Move block with index 12 (second yellow curved piece)\n    Step5: Move block with index 8 (second green rectangular block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 1 (top red block with cutout)\n}\n\nNotes on block selection:\n- For the red blocks with cutouts, I chose index 6 for bottom and index 1 for top based on their orientation\n- For the green rectangular blocks, index 8 is used twice as it matches the required horizontal orientation\n- For the yellow curved sections, index 12 is used twice to create the double-curved middle section\n- The blocks are stacked vertically with precise alignment to create the symmetric structure shown in the target image",

Left Structure (Table-like):\n- Base: 3 orange cylindrical pillars (block #10)\n- Middle: 2 yellow rectangular blocks (block #8)\n- Top: 1 green vertical block (block #7) with a yellow curved top (block #11)\n\n2. Right Structure (House-like):\n- Base: 2 green rectangular blocks (block #6)\n- Middle layer: Features red arch pieces (blocks #1 and #2)\n- Upper layer: Combination of green (block #5), blue (block #4), and orange triangular blocks (blocks #14, #15, #16)\n\nAssembly order for both structures:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\n    Step8: Move block with index 6\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 2\n    Step12: Move block with index 5\n    Step13: Move block with index 4\n    Step14: Move block with index 14\n    Step15: Move block with index 15\n    Step16: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nThe structures are built from bottom to top, ensuring stability during construction. Each block is used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation.",

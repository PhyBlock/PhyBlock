Green rectangular base\n2. Orange cylindrical post\n3. Frame made of:\n   - Two vertical green blocks\n   - Yellow horizontal blocks top and bottom\n   - Blue box with orange roof at top\n   - Orange triangular piece in the middle\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5 (green horizontal base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder)\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (green vertical left)\n    Step4: Move block with index 4 (green vertical right)\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (yellow horizontal bottom)\n    Step6: Move block with index 15 (orange triangle in frame)\n    Step7: Move block with index 10 (yellow horizontal top)\n    Step8: Move block with index 3 (green horizontal on top)\n    Step9: Move block with index 2 (blue box)\n    Step10: Move block with index 14 (orange roof triangle)\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to match exactly as shown in the dictionary, maintaining their exact orientations without any rotation. Each piece is carefully chosen to create the final structure as shown in the target image.",

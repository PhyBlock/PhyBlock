Base layer: Red arch (1 piece)\n2. Middle layer: 2 yellow semi-cylindrical blocks\n3. Top layer: 1 orange/red triangular roof piece\n\nRequired blocks from the dictionary and assembly order:\n1. The base needs block #1 (red arch piece)\n2. The middle layer needs two of block #6 (yellow curved blocks)\n3. The top needs block #14 (triangular roof piece)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThis will create the exact structure shown in the target image, matching all colors and orientations without requiring any rotations of the pieces.",

Train-like structure (left):\n- Blue cube on top\n- Yellow cylindrical/rounded block in middle\n- Two orange cylindrical blocks as wheels\n\n2. Abstract structure (right):\n- Green rectangular block on top\n- Blue rectangular block in middle\n- Four orange triangular/wedge blocks arranged around the blue block\n\nLet me break down the assembly steps for each structure:\n\nFor the Train Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (Place first orange cylinder as front wheel)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (Place second orange cylinder as back wheel)\n    Step3: Move block with index 10 (Place yellow rounded block on top of cylinders)\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (Place blue cube on top of yellow block)\n}\n\nFor the Abstract Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (Place blue rectangular block as center)\n    Step2: Move block with index 4 (Place green rectangular block on top)\n    Step3: Move block with index 13 (Place first orange triangular block on left)\n    Step4: Move block with index 14 (Place second orange triangular block on right)\n    Step5: Move block with index 15 (Place third orange triangular block in front)\n    Step6: Move block with index 16 (Place fourth orange triangular block in back)\n}\n\nThis solution uses the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary, maintaining their orientations and colors as shown.",

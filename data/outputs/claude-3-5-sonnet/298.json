A smaller structure (left) consisting of:\n   - Green rectangular base\n   - Orange cylindrical middle piece\n   - Orange triangular roof\n2. A larger structure (right) consisting of:\n   - Bottom layer: Red arch pieces with yellow blocks\n   - Middle layer: Red arch pieces with yellow blocks\n   - Top layer: Green vertical pieces with yellow horizontal blocks\n   - Orange triangular roof piece\n\nBlock Count and Layer Analysis:\nSmall structure: 3 blocks\nLarge structure: approximately 11 blocks\nTotal layers: Small structure has 3 layers, large structure has 4 layers\n\nAssembly Instructions:\nFor the small structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4 (green base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step3: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nFor the large structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step6: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal block)\n    Step7: Move block with index 5 (green vertical block)\n    Step8: Move block with index 5 (green vertical block)\n    Step9: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal block)\n    Step10: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe structure is built from bottom to top, ensuring stability throughout the construction process. The arches create the foundation, followed by connecting blocks, vertical supports, and finally the decorative roof elements.",

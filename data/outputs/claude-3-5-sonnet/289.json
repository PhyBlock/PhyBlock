Left Structure:\n- Consists of vertical orange cylinders with a red house-like structure supported by a yellow beam\n- The house structure has a yellow semicircular piece on top\n- Has an orange triangular piece on the very top\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- A collection of colored cubes (red, orange, green, blue) arranged vertically\n- Supported by yellow rectangular beams at top and bottom\n\nAnalysis and Block Count:\nLeft Structure (top to bottom):\n- 1 orange triangle (roof)\n- 2 cylindrical orange blocks\n- 1 red house-like structure with yellow semicircle\n- 1 yellow horizontal beam\n\nRight Structure (top to bottom):\n- 1 yellow horizontal beam (top)\n- 1 green cube\n- 1 blue cube\n- 1 orange cube\n- 1 red cube\n- 1 yellow horizontal beam (bottom)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (bottom yellow beam - right structure)\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 (red cube)\n    Step3: Move block with index 5 (orange cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 4 (green cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 3 (blue cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (top yellow beam - right structure)\n    Step7: Move block with index 9 (bottom orange cylinder - left structure)\n    Step8: Move block with index 9 (top orange cylinder - left structure)\n    Step9: Move block with index 7 (yellow supporting beam - left structure)\n    Step10: Move block with index 1 (red house structure)\n    Step11: Move block with index 10 (yellow semicircle)\n    Step12: Move block with index 13 (orange triangle roof)\n}",

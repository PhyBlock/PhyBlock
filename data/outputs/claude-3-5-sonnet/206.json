A tower-like structure on the left consisting of:\n- Two red arch pieces at the base\n- A yellow horizontal beam above the arches\n- Two green vertical pillars\n- Another yellow horizontal beam at the top\n- An orange triangular piece at the very top\n\n2. A vehicle-like structure on the right consisting of:\n- Two orange cylindrical pieces as wheels\n- A yellow horizontal beam\n- A blue cube on top\n\nLet me provide the assembly instructions for both structures:\n\nFor the left structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 1\nStep3: Move block with index 9\nStep4: Move block with index 8\nStep5: Move block with index 8\nStep6: Move block with index 9\nStep7: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nFor the right structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 11\nStep2: Move block with index 11\nStep3: Move block with index 9\nStep4: Move block with index 6\n}\n\nThe construction follows a bottom-up approach, where:\n- For the left structure, we first place the red arches, then the yellow beam, followed by the green pillars, another yellow beam, and finally the orange triangular piece\n- For the right structure, we place the orange cylinders first, then the yellow beam, and finally the blue cube on top\n\nEach block is used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation, matching the shapes, colors, and orientations precisely as needed.",

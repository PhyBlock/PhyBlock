Left Part:\n   - Base: Red piece with two semicircular cutouts\n   - Top: Blue cubic block on the left cutout\n\n2. Right Part:\n   - Bottom: Red piece with two arches\n   - Middle: Red piece with large circular hole\n   - Top: Yellow rectangular pieces forming a frame\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (Right part base, right arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 2 (Right part base, left arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 5 (Right part middle, circular hole piece)\n    Step4: Move block with index 14 (Right part top, yellow horizontal bar)\n    Step5: Move block with index 14 (Right part bottom, yellow horizontal bar)\n    Step6: Move block with index 3 (Left part base, piece with cutouts)\n    Step7: Move block with index 9 (Left part top, blue cube)\n}\n\nEach step builds the structure from bottom to top, starting with the right section and then completing the left section. The yellow bars frame the circular hole piece, and the separate left section is topped with the blue cube.",

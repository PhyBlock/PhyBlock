Bottom layer: Two red arch blocks (using block #1 and #2)\n2. Middle layer: Two horizontal green blocks (using block #5 and #6)\n3. Upper layer: One horizontal yellow block (using block #8)\n4. Top layer: One vertical orange cylinder (using block #10) with triangular roof (using block #14)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe blocks are assembled from bottom to top, creating a stable structure with two arches at the base, supported by rectangular blocks, and topped with a cylindrical tower with a roof.",

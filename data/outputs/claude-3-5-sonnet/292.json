Left Structure:\n- A vertical stack with red arch pieces on top and bottom\n- Blue and green cubes in the middle\n- 4 blocks total, 4 layers\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- A table-like structure with 4 orange cylindrical legs\n- Yellow rectangular blocks on top\n- A tower on top with green and blue cubes\n- Topped with a yellow curved piece\n- 8 blocks total, multiple layers\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 4 (red vertical piece bottom)\nStep2: Move block with index 6 (green cube)\nStep3: Move block with index 5 (blue cube)\nStep4: Move block with index 4 (red vertical piece top)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder)\nStep2: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder)\nStep3: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder)\nStep4: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder)\nStep5: Move block with index 7 (yellow rectangular block)\nStep6: Move block with index 7 (yellow rectangular block)\nStep7: Move block with index 6 (green cube)\nStep8: Move block with index 5 (blue cube)\nStep9: Move block with index 11 (yellow curved top)\n}\n\nThe structures should be built from bottom to top, ensuring stability throughout the construction process.",

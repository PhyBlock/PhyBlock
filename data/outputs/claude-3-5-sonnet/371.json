Left Structure:\n- A house-like shape with 4 blocks\n- Base: Red arch block\n- Middle: Blue cube\n- Top: Orange/red triangular roof\n- Yellow semicircular block on the arch\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- A taller structure with 5 blocks\n- Base: Blue cube and orange cube side by side\n- Middle: Red block with circular hole\n- Top: Green horizontal block\n- Orange/red triangular roof\n\nLet me determine the assembly order using blocks from the dictionary:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step3: Move block with index 13 (triangular roof)\n    Step4: Move block with index 8 (yellow semicircle)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 5 (orange cube)\n    Step7: Move block with index 3 (red block with hole)\n    Step8: Move block with index 6 (green horizontal block)\n    Step9: Move block with index 13 (triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to match exact orientations as shown in the dictionary, and the assembly order follows a bottom-to-top approach for stability.",

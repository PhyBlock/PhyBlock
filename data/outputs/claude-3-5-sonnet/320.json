A tree-like structure on the left consisting of:\n- A green rectangular base\n- An orange cylindrical trunk\n- A green top section with two vertical rectangular pieces\n\n2. A tunnel-like structure on the right made of:\n- Red arch pieces\n- Orange triangular side supports\n- Yellow curved pieces on top\n- Orange/red triangular roof pieces\n\nBlock Count and Layers:\nTree structure: 4 blocks (3 layers)\nTunnel structure: ~7-8 blocks (multiple connected pieces)\n\nLet me provide the step-by-step assembly instructions:\n\nFor the Tree:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 5 (green rectangular base)\nStep2: Move block with index 9 (orange cylinder)\nStep3: Move block with index 8 (green horizontal rectangle for top)\nStep4: Move block with index 6 (green vertical rectangle)\nStep5: Move block with index 7 (green vertical rectangle)\n}\n\nFor the Tunnel:\n{\nStep6: Move block with index 1 (red arch piece front)\nStep7: Move block with index 2 (red arch piece back)\nStep8: Move block with index 13 (orange triangle left)\nStep9: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle right)\nStep10: Move block with index 10 (yellow curved piece)\nStep11: Move block with index 10 (yellow curved piece second instance)\nStep12: Move block with index 14 (orange roof triangle)\nStep13: Move block with index 15 (orange roof triangle)\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to match exactly as they appear in the dictionary, maintaining their rotational orientation without any modifications.",

First placing the wheels as the foundation\n2. Then creating the yellow platform using two identical horizontal blocks\n3. Adding the red arch structure\n4. Finally topping it with the orange triangular roof piece\n\nThe blocks are matched exactly as they appear in the dictionary, maintaining their original orientations with no rotations needed.",

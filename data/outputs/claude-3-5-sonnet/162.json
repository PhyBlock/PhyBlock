A taller tower-like structure with:\n   - Orange cylindrical pillars at the base\n   - Yellow rectangular supports\n   - Green rectangular pillars in the middle\n   - An orange triangular roof\n\n2. A smaller house-like structure with:\n   - A blue cubic base\n   - An orange triangular roof\n   - Standing on a yellow rectangular platform\n   - Orange cylindrical supports underneath\n\nTotal layers: 4 layers in the taller structure, 2 layers in the smaller structure\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block 8 (orange cylinder - left base of tall structure)\n    Step2: Move block 8 (orange cylinder - right base of tall structure)\n    Step3: Move block 5 (yellow rectangular support - bottom of tall structure)\n    Step4: Move block 8 (orange cylinder - left support of small structure)\n    Step5: Move block 8 (orange cylinder - right support of small structure)\n    Step6: Move block 7 (yellow rectangular platform - for small structure)\n    Step7: Move block 3 (green vertical pillar - left side of tall structure)\n    Step8: Move block 3 (green vertical pillar - right side of tall structure)\n    Step9: Move block 6 (yellow rectangular support - middle of tall structure)\n    Step10: Move block 1 (blue cube - base of small house)\n    Step11: Move block 5 (yellow rectangular support - top of tall structure)\n    Step12: Move block 15 (orange triangular roof - for tall structure)\n    Step13: Move block 15 (orange triangular roof - for small house)\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence builds both structures from bottom to top, ensuring stability throughout the construction process.",

Place the first green cube as the base\n2. Stack the second green cube on top\n3. Add the left triangular piece\n4. Add the top triangular roof piece\n5. Add the right triangular piece\n\nEach block is used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation, matching the final target structure precisely.",

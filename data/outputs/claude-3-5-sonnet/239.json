Left structure: Made of alternating orange and green blocks, including cylinders, rectangular blocks, and triangular ramps\n2. Right structure: A cube-like construction with red, green, and blue blocks, featuring a curved cutout in the red section\n\nBlock count and layers:\n- Left structure: ~7-8 blocks arranged in a symmetrical pattern\n- Right structure: 4 blocks arranged in a 2x2 formation\n- Total height: 2-3 layers depending on the section\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\nFor the right structure (working bottom-up):\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2 (blue cube, bottom right)\nStep2: Move block with index 3 (green cube, bottom left)\nStep3: Move block with index 1 (red curved block, top right)\nStep4: Move block with index 4 (green rectangular block, top)\n}\n\nFor the left structure (working bottom-up):\n{\nStep5: Move block with index 14 (orange ramp, right)\nStep6: Move block with index 13 (orange ramp, left)\nStep7: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder, center)\nStep8: Move block with index 5 (green vertical block, left)\nStep9: Move block with index 5 (green vertical block, right)\nStep10: Move block with index 12 (orange triangular top)\n}\n\nThe blocks are used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation, and some blocks (like index 5) are used multiple times to create the symmetrical pattern.",

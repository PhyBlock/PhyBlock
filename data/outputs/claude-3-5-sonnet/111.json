A red base piece with two semi-circular indentations\n  2. A blue cube sitting on top of one of the indentations\n- There are 2 layers total (base layer and cube on top)\n\nRequired Blocks from Dictionary:\n- Looking at the base piece's orientation in the target image, we need block index 3 from the dictionary (red piece with two semi-circular indentations)\n- For the top cube, we need block index 9 (blue cube)\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n}\n\nThis will create the exact structure shown in the target image, with the red base piece properly oriented and the blue cube positioned on one of its indentations.",

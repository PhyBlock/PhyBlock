Left structure: A tunnel-like construction with a red base, yellow middle section, and orange roof\n2. Right structure: A more complex building with red arches as base, a tall orange cylinder in the middle, yellow blocks on sides, and a green block at the end, topped with an orange triangular roof\n\nBlock count: Approximately 12-15 blocks total\nLayers: Generally 3-4 layers in height\n\nLet me provide the assembly instructions for both structures, starting from left to right:\n\nLeft Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (yellow rectangular block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 12 (yellow curved block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nRight Structure:\n{\n    Step5: Move block with index 2 (red arch)\n    Step6: Move block with index 4 (red arch)\n    Step7: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder)\n    Step8: Move block with index 10 (yellow vertical block)\n    Step9: Move block with index 10 (yellow vertical block, second one)\n    Step10: Move block with index 6 (green vertical block)\n    Step11: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected based on their exact orientation as shown in the dictionary, and the assembly order follows a bottom-up, left-to-right approach to ensure stability and proper construction of both structures.",

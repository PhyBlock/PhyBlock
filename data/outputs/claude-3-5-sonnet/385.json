Left side: A red arch-like structure with yellow connecting pieces\n- 4 red arch blocks arranged in 2 layers\n- 2 yellow rectangular blocks connecting them horizontally\n\n2. Right side: A tower-like structure\n- 2 green vertical pillars\n- 1 yellow horizontal block on top\n- 1 orange cylindrical block\n- 1 yellow semi-circular cap\n\nTotal blocks: 9 blocks in the entire structure\nLayers: The structure has 3 layers in total\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6 (left green pillar)\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 (right green pillar)\n    Step3: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal block for right structure)\n    Step4: Move block with index 10 (orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step5: Move block with index 12 (yellow semi-circular cap)\n    Step6: Move block with index 1 (bottom left red arch)\n    Step7: Move block with index 2 (bottom right red arch)\n    Step8: Move block with index 9 (yellow connecting block for bottom)\n    Step9: Move block with index 1 (top left red arch)\n    Step10: Move block with index 2 (top right red arch)\n    Step11: Move block with index 8 (yellow connecting block for top)\n}\n\nThe assembly is built from bottom to top, starting with the right tower structure and then building the left arch structure. Each piece is placed in its exact orientation as shown in the block dictionary, with no rotation needed.",

Left Structure:\n- A small house-like shape\n- Bottom layer: Two orange/red cubes side by side\n- Middle layer: One horizontal green block on top\n- Top layer: One orange triangular block\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- A frame-like structure on a base\n- Base: One horizontal green block\n- Middle: One orange cylindrical pillar\n- Frame: Made of green vertical blocks and yellow horizontal blocks, with an orange triangular block inside\n\nAnalysis of blocks needed and assembly order:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2 (first orange cube)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (second orange cube)\nStep3: Move block with index 7 (horizontal green block)\nStep4: Move block with index 15 (orange triangle)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 4 (horizontal green base)\nStep2: Move block with index 12 (orange cylinder)\nStep3: Move block with index 5 (left vertical green block)\nStep4: Move block with index 6 (right vertical green block)\nStep5: Move block with index 8 (top yellow horizontal block)\nStep6: Move block with index 11 (bottom yellow horizontal block)\nStep7: Move block with index 15 (orange triangle)\n}\n\nThe structures can be built independently, but I've listed them separately for clarity. Each structure follows a bottom-up assembly approach to ensure stability.",

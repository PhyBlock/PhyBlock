Red arch block (base)\n  2. Green horizontal rectangular block\n  3. Blue cubic block\n  4. Orange/red triangular roof piece\n\nSpatial Relationships:\n- The red arch block serves as the foundation\n- The green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the red arch\n- A blue cube sits on top of the green block\n- The structure is topped with a triangular orange roof piece\n\nBlock Selection from Dictionary:\nLooking at the block dictionary, I can identify the needed pieces:\n- Red arch block: Block #1\n- Green horizontal block: Block #8\n- Blue cube: Block #6\n- Orange triangular roof: Block #11\n\nAssembly Order:\nHere's the step-by-step construction sequence:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n}\n\nThe assembly follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the foundation and building upward to create a stable structure that matches the target image exactly.",

Bottom Layer:\n- Two identical vertical green blocks for the pillars (using block #5)\n\n2. Middle Layer:\n- One horizontal yellow block (using block #8)\n\n3. Top Layer:\n- One red arch piece (using block #1)\n- Two orange triangular roof pieces (using blocks #15 and #16)\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 5 (left green pillar)\nStep2: Move block with index 5 (right green pillar)\nStep3: Move block with index 8 (horizontal yellow connector)\nStep4: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\nStep5: Move block with index 15 (left orange roof piece)\nStep6: Move block with index 16 (right orange roof piece)\n}\n\nThis sequence will construct the structure exactly as shown in the target image, using the blocks in their correct orientations without any rotation.",

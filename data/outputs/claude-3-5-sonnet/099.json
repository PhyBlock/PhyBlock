Base: 2 blue blocks with yellow blocks on top\n2. Middle: 1 orange cylinder and 2 orange triangular pieces\n3. Top: 1 red piece with 2 yellow curved tops\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary and assembly order:\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 6\nStep2: Move block with index 6\nStep3: Move block with index 7\nStep4: Move block with index 7\nStep5: Move block with index 15\nStep6: Move block with index 8\nStep7: Move block with index 16\nStep8: Move block with index 2\nStep9: Move block with index 11\nStep10: Move block with index 11\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence:\n1. Starts with the blue base blocks (6)\n2. Adds the yellow horizontal blocks (7)\n3. Places the orange triangular sides (15, 16)\n4. Positions the central orange cylinder (8)\n5. Places the red U-shaped top piece (2)\n6. Finishes with the yellow curved top pieces (11)\n\nEach block is selected to match the exact orientation as shown in the dictionary, and the assembly builds from bottom to top in a stable manner.",

A vertical tower (left structure):\n- Contains 7 blocks\n- Has 4 layers\n- Uses cube-shaped and rectangular blocks in red, blue, green, orange, and yellow\n\n2. A tunnel/portal structure (right structure):\n- Contains 3 blocks\n- Made of red blocks with a circular hole and yellow rectangular blocks on top and bottom\n\nLet me break down the assembly for each structure:\n\nFor the Tower (left structure), from bottom to top:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 5 (blue cube)\nStep2: Move block with index 8 (yellow cube)\nStep3: Move block with index 6 (orange cube)\nStep4: Move block with index 7 (red cube)\nStep5: Move block with index 11 (green rectangular block)\nStep6: Move block with index 5 (blue cube)\nStep7: Move block with index 7 (red cube)\n}\n\nFor the Portal/Tunnel structure (right structure):\n{\nStep8: Move block with index 14 (yellow horizontal rectangular block)\nStep9: Move block with index 1 (red portal block)\nStep10: Move block with index 14 (yellow horizontal rectangular block)\n}\n\nThe blocks are used exactly as they appear in the dictionary, maintaining their original orientations. Note that some blocks (like the blue cube index 5) are used multiple times in the tower structure.",

A tower-like structure with:\n   - Base: Red block with two semicircular cutouts\n   - Middle: Blue cube and green rectangular block\n   - Top: Red arch piece with an orange triangular roof\n2. A separate balance-beam structure with:\n   - Two orange cylindrical blocks as supports\n   - Yellow rectangular block on top\n\nTotal blocks used: 8 blocks\nNumber of layers: \n- Tower: 4 layers\n- Balance beam: 2 layers\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\nFor the tower structure (from bottom up):\n1. Base: Block #2 for the red base with cutouts\n2. Middle: Block #5 for the blue cube\n3. Middle: Block #7 for the green rectangular block\n4. Top: Block #1 for the red arch\n5. Roof: Block #15 for the orange triangular piece\n\nFor the balance beam structure:\n6. Support 1: Block #11 for first orange cylinder\n7. Support 2: Block #11 for second orange cylinder\n8. Top: Block #8 for the yellow rectangular block\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n}",

A square frame at the top (made of yellow and green blocks)\n  2. A central orange cylindrical pole\n  3. A green rectangular base\n\nTotal blocks used: 7 blocks arranged in the following layers:\n- Top: Yellow horizontal block\n- Upper middle: Two vertical green blocks and an orange triangular block\n- Lower middle: Yellow horizontal block\n- Bottom section: Orange cylinder and green horizontal base\n\nAssembly Order (matching blocks from the dictionary):\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 (Green horizontal base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 10 (Orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (Yellow horizontal block for bottom frame)\n    Step4: Move block with index 3 (Green vertical block for left side)\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (Green vertical block for right side)\n    Step6: Move block with index 15 (Orange triangular block in the middle)\n    Step7: Move block with index 7 (Yellow horizontal block for top frame)\n}\n\nEach block is selected to match the exact orientation as shown in the dictionary without any rotation needed. The assembly starts from the bottom and works its way up to create a stable structure.",

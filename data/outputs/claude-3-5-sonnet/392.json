Base layer: 4 yellow blocks (horizontal) and 3 orange cylinders\n2. Middle layer: 1 green block, 1 blue block, 1 yellow block, 2 red arch pieces\n3. Top layer: 1 red arch gateway piece, 2 orange triangular roof pieces\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9 (yellow horizontal base - left)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (yellow horizontal base - middle)\n    Step3: Move block with index 9 (yellow horizontal base - right)\n    Step4: Move block with index 12 (orange cylinder - left)\n    Step5: Move block with index 12 (orange cylinder - middle)\n    Step6: Move block with index 12 (orange cylinder - right)\n    Step7: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block)\n    Step8: Move block with index 5 (blue cube)\n    Step9: Move block with index 6 (yellow cube)\n    Step10: Move block with index 2 (red U-shaped piece - left)\n    Step11: Move block with index 2 (red U-shaped piece - right)\n    Step12: Move block with index 1 (red arch gateway)\n    Step13: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular roof - left)\n    Step14: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular roof - right)\n}\n\nThe structure requires 14 steps to complete, using blocks from the dictionary multiple times where needed to create symmetrical elements.",

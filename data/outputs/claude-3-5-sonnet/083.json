Bottom layer: Red cube (Block #2) for the right side\n2. Bottom layer: Yellow cube (Block #3) for the left side\n3. Middle layer: Green horizontal rectangle (Block #4) spanning across both bottom cubes\n4. Top layer: Two orange triangular roof pieces (Block #15) placed side by side\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 15\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nThe roof requires two identical triangular pieces (Block #15) to create the complete roof shape. Note that this block is used twice to form the complete roof structure.",

Bottom layer: Two green blocks side by side\n2. Second layer: Two blocks - one orange and one green\n3. Third layer: Three blocks - two blue blocks with a yellow block in between\n4. Top layer: One orange triangular roof piece\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 (green cube, left bottom)\n    Step2: Move block with index 2 (green cube, right bottom)\n    Step3: Move block with index 3 (orange cube, left middle)\n    Step4: Move block with index 2 (green cube, right middle)\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (blue cube, left top)\n    Step6: Move block with index 5 (yellow cube, center top)\n    Step7: Move block with index 1 (blue cube, right top)\n    Step8: Move block with index 12 (orange triangular roof piece)\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence will create the house-like structure shown in the target image, using the exact orientations of blocks as shown in the block dictionary.",

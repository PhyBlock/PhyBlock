Left Structure (Vehicle-like):\n- Two orange cylindrical blocks as base/wheels\n- One yellow rectangular block on top\n- One blue cubic block on the yellow block\n\n2. Right Structure (Tower-like):\n- Two orange cylindrical pillars\n- Yellow rectangular platforms crossing the pillars\n- Two orange triangular roof pieces\n\nTotal layers: 3-4 depending on the section\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\nLet me provide the step-by-step assembly instructions:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9 (horizontal orange cylinder for left structure base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (horizontal orange cylinder for left structure base)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal rectangle for left structure platform)\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (blue cube for left structure top)\n    Step5: Move block with index 8 (vertical orange cylinder for right structure left pillar)\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (vertical orange cylinder for right structure right pillar)\n    Step7: Move block with index 5 (yellow horizontal rectangle for right structure lower platform)\n    Step8: Move block with index 5 (yellow horizontal rectangle for right structure upper platform)\n    Step9: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle roof piece)\n    Step10: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle roof piece)\n    Step11: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle roof piece for top)\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence starts with the left structure (vehicle-like) from bottom to top, then moves to the right structure (tower-like) also building from bottom to top. Each component is carefully selected to match the exact orientation shown in the block dictionary.",

Base layer: Red curved pieces and triangular supports\n2. Middle layer: Green, blue, and yellow cubes with orange cylinder\n3. Top layer: Red curved piece with yellow dome tops\n\nBlock selection and assembly order:\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2 (red curved base piece, right side)\nStep2: Move block with index 3 (red curved base piece, right side)\nStep3: Move block with index 1 (red curved base piece, right side)\nStep4: Move block with index 16 (orange triangular support, left side)\nStep5: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular support, left side)\nStep6: Move block with index 9 (orange cylinder in center)\nStep7: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block, left base)\nStep8: Move block with index 6 (green cube, left stack)\nStep9: Move block with index 5 (blue cube, left stack)\nStep10: Move block with index 7 (yellow cube, left stack)\nStep11: Move block with index 2 (red curved top piece)\nStep12: Move block with index 12 (yellow dome top, twice)\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence will recreate the target structure exactly as shown in the main image, using the blocks as they appear in the dictionary without any rotation.",

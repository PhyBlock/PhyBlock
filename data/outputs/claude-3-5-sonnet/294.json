Left Structure (Tower):\n- Three orange cylindrical blocks stacked vertically\n- Red arch-like structure with yellow top\n- Orange triangular top piece\n\n2. Right Structure (Platform):\n- Two orange cylindrical blocks as base\n- Yellow horizontal beam across them\n- Blue cube on one end\n- Yellow cylindrical piece on the other end\n\nStep-by-step assembly instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (horizontal orange cylinder - right structure base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (horizontal orange cylinder - right structure base)\n    Step3: Move block with index 5 (yellow horizontal beam for platform)\n    Step4: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (yellow half-cylinder end piece)\n    Step6: Move block with index 7 (vertical orange cylinder - tower base)\n    Step7: Move block with index 7 (vertical orange cylinder - tower middle)\n    Step8: Move block with index 7 (vertical orange cylinder - tower top)\n    Step9: Move block with index 1 (red arch structure)\n    Step10: Move block with index 5 (yellow horizontal support)\n    Step11: Move block with index 10 (yellow half-cylinder top)\n    Step12: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular top piece)\n}",

Bottom: Yellow horizontal block with two green vertical cylinders\n2. Middle: Yellow horizontal block with two orange vertical cylinders\n3. Top: Yellow horizontal block\n4. Peak: Orange triangular block\n\nAssembly order using blocks from the dictionary:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6 (bottom yellow horizontal support)\n    Step2: Move block with index 3 (left green vertical cylinder)\n    Step3: Move block with index 3 (right green vertical cylinder)\n    Step4: Move block with index 6 (middle yellow horizontal support)\n    Step5: Move block with index 9 (left orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 9 (right orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step7: Move block with index 6 (top yellow horizontal support)\n    Step8: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular block on top)\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, ensuring stability throughout the construction process. Each piece matches exactly with the orientation shown in the block dictionary without any rotation needed.",

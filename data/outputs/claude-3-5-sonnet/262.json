Left Structure:\n- A small \"house-like\" structure made of green blocks with orange triangular pieces\n- 2 green cubes stacked vertically with orange triangular pieces on sides and top\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- A taller \"tower-like\" structure with a bridge\n- 2 vertical green rectangular blocks as supports\n- A horizontal yellow rectangular block across the top of the supports\n- Red and blue cubes stacked on one end\n- Yellow curved piece on top\n\nLet me provide the step-by-step assembly instructions:\n\nFor the Left Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2 (green cube base)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (green cube on top)\nStep3: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle right side)\nStep4: Move block with index 15 (orange triangle left side)\nStep5: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle roof)\n}\n\nFor the Right Structure:\n{\nStep6: Move block with index 4 (green rectangular block left support)\nStep7: Move block with index 4 (green rectangular block right support)\nStep8: Move block with index 5 (yellow rectangular block bridge)\nStep9: Move block with index 3 (red cube)\nStep10: Move block with index 1 (blue cube)\nStep11: Move block with index 6 (yellow curved top)\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected carefully to match the exact orientation as shown in the dictionary image, with no rotation needed.",

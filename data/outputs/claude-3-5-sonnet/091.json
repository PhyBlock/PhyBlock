First placing all four orange pillars to create the base\n2. Adding the two horizontal yellow platforms on top\n3. Stacking the green cube, then the blue cube\n4. Finally topping with the yellow dome piece\n\nEach block is used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation, matching the target structure precisely.",

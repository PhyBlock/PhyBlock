Left structure: A house-like construction with:\n   - Base: Two red arch blocks\n   - Middle layer: One yellow horizontal block\n   - Top layer: Two green cubes and one blue vertical block\n   - Roof: One orange triangular block\n\n2. Right structure: A tunnel-like construction with:\n   - One red arch block on top\n   - Two blue cubes in the middle\n   - One red C-shaped block at the bottom\n\nTotal blocks used: 10 blocks across multiple layers\n\nAssembly Instructions:\nFor the left structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 \n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nFor the right structure:\n{\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 8\n    Step10: Move block with index 8\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence follows a bottom-up approach for both structures, ensuring stability during construction. Each block is selected from the dictionary to match exactly the orientation and color shown in the target image.",

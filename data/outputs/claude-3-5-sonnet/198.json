Base layer: 1 blue block and 1 green block side by side\n2. Middle layer: 1 red curved block\n3. Top layer: 1 green block\n\nRight Structure:\n1. Base layer: 2 red curved blocks connected\n2. Middle layer: 1 blue block and 1 green block\n3. Top layer: 1 orange triangular block\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4 (blue cube - left structure base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 5 (green cube - left structure base)\n    Step3: Move block with index 2 (red curved block - left structure middle)\n    Step4: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block - left structure top)\n    Step5: Move block with index 2 (red curved block - right structure base)\n    Step6: Move block with index 2 (red curved block - right structure base)\n    Step7: Move block with index 4 (blue cube - right structure middle)\n    Step8: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block - right structure middle)\n    Step9: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular block - right structure top)\n}",

A train-like structure made of colored blocks (right side)\n2. A tower-like structure with yellow houses and orange pillars (left side)\n\nThe structure consists of multiple layers and uses various colored blocks including red, blue, green, yellow, and orange.\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\nThe structure should be built from bottom to top, starting with the train section first, then the tower.\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch block for train base left)\n    Step2: Move block with index 2 (red arch block for train base right)\n    Step3: Move block with index 12 (yellow half-cylinder for train top left)\n    Step4: Move block with index 12 (yellow half-cylinder for train top right)\n    Step5: Move block with index 3 (blue cube for train body)\n    Step6: Move block with index 5 (green vertical block for back)\n    Step7: Move block with index 13 (yellow small cube for top)\n    Step8: Move block with index 6 (green horizontal block)\n    Step9: Move block with index 13 (yellow small cube for top)\n    Step10: Move block with index 4 (orange cube)\n    Step11: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder left pillar)\n    Step12: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder right pillar)\n    Step13: Move block with index 7 (yellow horizontal block house base left)\n    Step14: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal block house base right)\n    Step15: Move block with index 16 (orange roof left)\n    Step16: Move block with index 16 (orange roof right)\n    Step17: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder top pillar)\n    Step18: Move block with index 16 (orange roof top)\n}\n\nThis sequence will create the complete structure as shown in the target image, with all blocks in their correct orientations and positions.",

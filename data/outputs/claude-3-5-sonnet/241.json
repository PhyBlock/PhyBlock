A vertical tower with 6 blocks (from bottom to top):\n   - Red arch block\n   - Green rectangular block\n   - Blue cube and yellow cube side by side\n   - Green rectangular block\n   - Red arch block\n2. A horizontal construction with 2 blocks:\n   - Red double-arch block\n   - Blue cube on top of the middle section\n\nBlock Count: 8 blocks total\nLayers: The tower has 5 layers, the separate construction has 2 layers\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary (matching exact orientations):\n- Red arch blocks (#1, #2)\n- Green rectangular blocks (#12, #12)\n- Blue cube blocks (#8, #8)\n- Yellow cube block (#11)\n- Red double-arch block (#3)\n\nAssembly instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (bottom red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 12 (green rectangular)\n    Step3: Move block with index 8 (blue cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 11 (yellow cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 12 (green rectangular)\n    Step6: Move block with index 2 (top red arch)\n    Step7: Move block with index 3 (red double-arch base)\n    Step8: Move block with index 8 (blue cube on double-arch)\n}",

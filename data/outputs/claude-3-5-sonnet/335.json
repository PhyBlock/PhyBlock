Main Assembly (Left):\n- Base: 3 orange cylindrical pillars\n- Middle: 2 yellow rectangular blocks horizontally placed\n- Top: 1 green vertical block with a yellow curved top\n\n2. Secondary Assembly (Right):\n- 2 yellow curved blocks\n- 1 green cube\n- 1 blue cube arranged in a row\n\nBlock count: 9 total blocks\nLayers: Main assembly has 3 layers, Secondary assembly has 1 layer\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary and assembly order:\n\nFor Main Assembly:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nFor Secondary Assembly:\n{\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 2\n    Step11: Move block with index 1\n}\n\nThe blocks are chosen to exactly match the orientations shown in the dictionary without any rotation. The assembly order starts from the bottom up for the main structure, then builds the secondary structure from left to right.",

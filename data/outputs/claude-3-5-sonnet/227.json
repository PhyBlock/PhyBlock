Left Structure:\n- Has multiple layers with red, orange, and yellow blocks\n- Contains cylindrical pillars, a red block with a hole, yellow rectangular supports\n- Topped with an orange triangular block\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- Made of green vertical pieces forming a frame\n- Has yellow rectangular supports\n- Contains an orange triangular block\n- Supported by an orange cylindrical pillar\n- Has a green base\n\nBlock Count and Layer Analysis:\nTotal blocks needed: approximately 13-14 blocks\nMultiple layers with careful stacking required\n\nAssembly Instructions:\nFor the left structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10 (bottom yellow support)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (red block with hole)\nStep3: Move block with index 10 (middle yellow support)\nStep4: Move block with index 11 (left orange pillar)\nStep5: Move block with index 11 (right orange pillar)\nStep6: Move block with index 10 (top yellow support)\nStep7: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle on top)\n}\n\nFor the right structure:\n{\nStep8: Move block with index 5 (green base)\nStep9: Move block with index 11 (orange pillar)\nStep10: Move block with index 6 (left green vertical)\nStep11: Move block with index 7 (right green vertical)\nStep12: Move block with index 10 (yellow top support)\nStep13: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle)\n}\n\nThe blocks have been selected to match the exact orientations shown in the dictionary, with no rotations applied. The assembly order follows a bottom-up approach for stability.",

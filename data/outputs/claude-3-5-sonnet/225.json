A smaller structure on the left with:\n   - A red arch block base\n   - A blue cube and yellow cube on top\n\n2. A larger structure on the right with:\n   - Two red arch blocks at the base\n   - Yellow horizontal blocks connecting them\n   - Two red arch blocks on top\n   - Yellow blocks filling the gaps\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\n\nFor the left structure:\n1. Need block #2 (red arch) for base\n2. Need block #7 (blue cube) for top left\n3. Need block #11 (yellow cube) for top right\n\nFor the right structure:\n1. Need blocks #1 and #2 (red arches) for base\n2. Need block #12 (yellow horizontal) to connect them\n3. Need blocks #3 and #4 (red arches) for top layer\n4. Need blocks #11 and #11 (yellow cubes) to fill gaps\n5. Need block #12 (yellow horizontal) for top connection\n\nComplete assembly instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 11\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n    Step11: Move block with index 12\n}",

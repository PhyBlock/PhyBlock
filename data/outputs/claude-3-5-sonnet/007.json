      "text": "Let me analyze the target structure and provide a detailed solution.\n\nAnalysis of Main Target Image:\n- The structure consists of 6 blocks in total\n- It has orange (red) and blue blocks\n- There are effectively 2 layers: ground level and the vertical tower\n- The central piece is a tall orange cylinder with a triangular top\n- Two blue rectangular blocks are placed on opposite sides of the central tower\n- Three triangular/wedge-shaped orange pieces surround the structure\n\nBlock Selection and Spatial Arrangement:\n1. Central tower: Block #4 (vertical orange cylinder) with Block #12 (triangular top)\n2. Blue blocks: Block #2 and Block #3 (rectangular blue blocks)\n3. Side wedges: Block #14 and Block #15 (orange triangular pieces)\n\nAssembly Order (from bottom up):\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4    // Place central cylinder\n    Step2: Move block with index 2    // Place first blue block on left\n    Step3: Move block with index 3    // Place second blue block on right\n    Step4: Move block with index 14   // Place first triangular piece\n    Step5: Move block with index 15   // Place second triangular piece\n    Step6: Move block with index 12   // Place top triangular piece\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence ensures stability and creates the exact structure shown in the target image, matching all rotational orientations as shown in the block dictionary.",

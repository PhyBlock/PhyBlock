Each piece has the correct curvature to form the circular opening.\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n}\n\nThe assembly should be done in a clockwise manner, starting with the top left quarter, then top right, bottom right, and finally bottom left to complete the square frame with the circular opening. Each piece needs to be placed so that the curved sections align properly to form the complete circle in the center.",

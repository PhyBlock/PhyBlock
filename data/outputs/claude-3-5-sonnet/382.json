Left section: An archway made of red, orange, and green blocks\n2. Right section: A frame-like structure with yellow, green, red, and blue blocks\n\nThe structure has multiple layers and appears to use approximately 15-16 blocks in total.\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\nLet me break this down by building the structure from left to right, bottom to top.\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10 // Yellow horizontal base for right section\nStep2: Move block with index 10 // Yellow horizontal top for right section\nStep3: Move block with index 8 // Green vertical pillar (right section, right side)\nStep4: Move block with index 8 // Green vertical pillar (right section, left side)\nStep5: Move block with index 5 // Red square block (right section, upper middle)\nStep6: Move block with index 4 // Blue square block (right section, lower middle)\nStep7: Move block with index 8 // Green vertical pillar (left section, left side)\nStep8: Move block with index 8 // Green vertical pillar (left section, right side)\nStep9: Move block with index 11 // Orange cylindrical pillar (left)\nStep10: Move block with index 11 // Orange cylindrical pillar (right)\nStep11: Move block with index 1 // Red arch top piece\nStep12: Move block with index 14 // Orange triangular slope (left)\nStep13: Move block with index 16 // Orange triangular slope (right)\nStep14: Move block with index 15 // Orange triangular top piece\n}\n\nThis assembly order ensures stability by building from the ground up and maintains the correct spatial relationships between all components. Each block is used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation.",

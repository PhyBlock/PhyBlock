Bottom layer: Two yellow curved blocks\n2. Second layer: One blue cube and one green rectangular block side by side\n3. Third layer: One yellow horizontal rectangular block across both lower blocks\n4. Fourth layer: One red block with a circular hole\n5. Fifth layer: One green horizontal rectangular block\n6. Top layer: One orange triangular roof piece\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 11 (two yellow curved blocks at the bottom)\nStep2: Move block with index 3 (blue cube on left)\nStep3: Move block with index 7 (green rectangular block on right)\nStep4: Move block with index 10 (yellow horizontal rectangular block)\nStep5: Move block with index 1 (red block with circular hole)\nStep6: Move block with index 7 (green horizontal rectangular block)\nStep7: Move block with index 16 (orange triangular roof piece)\n}\n\nThe blocks are stacked from bottom to top, ensuring stability and matching the exact orientations shown in the dictionary image. Each block is selected to precisely match the shape, color, and orientation needed in the target structure.",

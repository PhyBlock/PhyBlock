Base layer: Red arch blocks forming the base/wheels\n2. Middle layer: Yellow cylindrical blocks on top of red arches, green rectangular blocks\n3. Top layer: Yellow tall blocks, blue cube with orange roof\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 (red arch block - right)\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 (green horizontal block - on top of right arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 (red arch block - middle)\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (red arch block - left)\n    Step5: Move block with index 12 (yellow cylindrical block - right)\n    Step6: Move block with index 12 (yellow cylindrical block - middle)\n    Step7: Move block with index 12 (yellow cylindrical block - left)\n    Step8: Move block with index 7 (green vertical block - behind right arch)\n    Step9: Move block with index 7 (green vertical block - behind left arch)\n    Step10: Move block with index 11 (yellow tall block - right back)\n    Step11: Move block with index 11 (yellow tall block - left back)\n    Step12: Move block with index 3 (blue cube - rightmost)\n    Step13: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular roof - on top of blue cube)\n}\n\nThis sequence will create the complete structure as shown in the target image, maintaining all spatial relationships and orientations of the blocks.",

A T-shaped structure with blue blocks forming a T, orange triangular pieces on the sides, and a green block on top\n2. A red arch/bridge structure to the right\n\nStructure Details:\n- T-shaped structure:\n  * Base layer: Blue blocks in T formation with orange triangular pieces\n  * Top layer: Single green block on top of the T intersection\n- Red arch structure:\n  * Single structure with an arched opening\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\n\nFor the T-shaped structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7 (blue cube for T base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (blue cube for T base)\n    Step3: Move block with index 9 (blue cube for T base)\n    Step4: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular piece - left side)\n    Step5: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular piece - right side)\n    Step6: Move block with index 4 (green cube for top)\n}\n\nFor the red arch structure:\n{\n    Step7: Move block with index 2 (red arch piece)\n}\n\nThis solution uses the exact blocks as shown in the dictionary without any rotation, matching both the shape and color requirements of the target structure.",

Left Structure:\n- Tall vertical arrangement\n- Yellow rectangular blocks in the middle\n- Green blocks at top and bottom\n- 3 layers total\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- More complex assembly with multiple components\n- Red arch base\n- Green horizontal block in middle\n- Blue cube with orange triangular roof on top\n- Two orange cylindrical pillars on sides\n- 4 layers total\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Instructions:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7 (bottom green vertical block)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (yellow vertical block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (top green horizontal block)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 (green horizontal block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular roof)\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (first orange cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 10 (second orange cylinder)\n}\n\nThe blocks are arranged in layers from bottom to top, with supporting blocks placed first before adding upper layers. Each block is used exactly as shown in the dictionary without rotation.",

First train car with blue cube and red roof\n2. Middle section with yellow cylinders and yellow tall blocks\n3. Second train car with orange cube and red roof\n4. Orange ramp/slope connecting to\n5. Standalone tunnel section with red frames and green blocks\n\nLet me provide the step-by-step assembly order using blocks from the dictionary:\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 (red arch - base of first car)\nStep2: Move block with index 4 (blue cube - first car body)\nStep3: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof - first car)\nStep4: Move block with index 2 (red arch - base of middle section)\nStep5: Move block with index 11 (yellow semicylinder - middle cargo)\nStep6: Move block with index 11 (yellow semicylinder - middle cargo)\nStep7: Move block with index 10 (yellow tall block - back)\nStep8: Move block with index 10 (yellow tall block - back)\nStep9: Move block with index 5 (green cube - middle support)\nStep10: Move block with index 1 (red arch - base of second car)\nStep11: Move block with index 6 (orange cube - second car body)\nStep12: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof - second car)\nStep13: Move block with index 16 (orange ramp)\nStep14: Move block with index 1 (red tunnel frame)\nStep15: Move block with index 7 (green horizontal block - tunnel middle)\nStep16: Move block with index 1 (red tunnel frame)\n}",

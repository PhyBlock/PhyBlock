A house-like structure (left):\n- Bottom: Red arch block\n- Middle: Green rectangular block\n- Top: Blue cubic block\n- Roof: Orange triangular block\nTotal: 4 layers, 4 blocks\n\n2. A tunnel-like structure (right):\n- Central: Red circular tunnel block with green sides\n- Top and bottom: Yellow horizontal blocks\nTotal: 3 layers, 4 blocks (1 red tunnel, 2 green sides, 2 yellow blocks)\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Instructions:\n\nFor the house structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2 (red arch base)\nStep2: Move block with index 7 (green horizontal block)\nStep3: Move block with index 5 (blue cube)\nStep4: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nFor the tunnel structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 12 (yellow horizontal block - bottom)\nStep2: Move block with index 9 (green vertical block - left)\nStep3: Move block with index 3 (red circular tunnel piece)\nStep4: Move block with index 9 (green vertical block - right)\nStep5: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal block - top)\n}\n\nEach block is selected from the dictionary to match the exact orientation and color as shown in the target image. The assembly order is from bottom to top for stability.",

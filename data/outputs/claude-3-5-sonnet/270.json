Left Structure:\n- Contains orange triangular roofs, a central orange cylinder, and blue cubic blocks\n- Has multiple levels with triangular slopes\n- Orange cylinder in the middle with triangular roof\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- More complex arrangement with multiple colored blocks\n- Contains yellow, blue, red, and green blocks\n- Has a triangular orange roof on top\n- Multiple levels of cubic and rectangular blocks\n\nBlock Count and Layers:\n- Total blocks used: approximately 10-12 blocks\n- Multiple layers in both structures\n\nLet me provide the assembly instructions for both structures:\n\nLeft Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 12 (orange cylinder)\nStep2: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\nStep3: Move block with index 6 (blue cube)\nStep4: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\nStep5: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nRight Structure:\n{\nStep6: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\nStep7: Move block with index 1 (red block)\nStep8: Move block with index 5 (green cube)\nStep9: Move block with index 8 (yellow rectangular block)\nStep10: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to match exactly as they appear in the dictionary image, considering their orientation, color, and shape. No rotation of blocks was needed as the dictionary provided the exact orientations required for the construction.",

A castle-like structure with:\n   - Red arch base\n   - Green horizontal block\n   - Blue cube\n   - Orange triangular roof\n   - Two orange cylindrical towers on sides\n2. A bridge-like structure with:\n   - Two orange cylinders as supports\n   - Yellow horizontal block on top\n\nTotal block count: 8 blocks\nLayers: Multiple (up to 4 layers in the castle part)\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary:\n- Red arch block (index 1)\n- Blue cube (index 2)\n- Green rectangular block (index 5)\n- Yellow rectangular block (index 6)\n- Orange cylindrical blocks (index 8) - needed 4 times\n- Orange triangular roof (index 12)\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 5 (green rectangular block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 2 (blue cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 12 (orange triangular roof)\n    Step5: Move block with index 8 (left orange cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (right orange cylinder)\n    Step7: Move block with index 8 (left cylinder of bridge)\n    Step8: Move block with index 8 (right cylinder of bridge)\n    Step9: Move block with index 6 (yellow rectangular block)\n}",

A base with an arch (in red)\n  2. Two triangular roof pieces (in orange)\n- The structure has 2 layers: the base layer and the roof layer\n\nRequired Blocks from Dictionary:\n- For the base: Block #1 (red arch piece)\n- For the roof: Block #11 and #12 (orange triangular pieces that form the roof)\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n}\n\nThe assembly starts with placing the base arch piece (block #1), followed by placing the two triangular roof pieces (blocks #11 and #12) on top to complete the roof structure. The blocks must be used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation.",

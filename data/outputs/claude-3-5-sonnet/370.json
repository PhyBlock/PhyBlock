Green horizontal block (index 10) for the middle beam\n2. Red arch block (index 1) for top arch\n3. Red double arch block (index 2) for bottom arches\n\nFor the right house-like structure:\n1. Blue cube (index 5) for the base\n2. Green horizontal block (index 10) for the middle layer\n3. Red arch block (index 1) for the top\n4. Orange triangular block (index 15) for the roof\n\nFor the curved path:\n1. Red curved blocks (index 3 and 4) for the winding path\n\nAssembly sequence:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5 (blue cube base for house)\n    Step2: Move block with index 10 (green horizontal block for house)\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 (red arch for house top)\n    Step4: Move block with index 15 (orange triangle roof)\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (green horizontal block for bridge)\n    Step6: Move block with index 1 (red arch for bridge top)\n    Step7: Move block with index 2 (red double arch for bridge bottom)\n    Step8: Move block with index 3 (red curved block for path)\n    Step9: Move block with index 4 (red curved block for path)\n}",

Left structure: A symmetrical arrangement with green vertical blocks and orange triangular/sloped pieces\n2. Right structure: A U-shaped green construction on top of an orange cylindrical piece, with a green base\n\nAnalysis of required blocks from dictionary:\n- Green rectangular blocks in various orientations (indices 1-5)\n- Orange cylindrical blocks (indices 6-7)\n- Orange triangular/sloped pieces (indices 12-16)\n\nLet me provide the assembly instructions for both structures.\n\nFor the left structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 14\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nFor the right structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n}\n\nThe blocks are used in their exact orientations as shown in the dictionary, with no rotations needed. The green U-shape in the right structure is created by placing two vertical blocks on top of a horizontal connector piece, while the left structure uses the triangular pieces to create a symmetrical sloped appearance.",

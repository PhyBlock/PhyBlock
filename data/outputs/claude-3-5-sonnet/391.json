A bridge/arch-like structure on the right made of red and yellow blocks\n\nLet me break down each structure and provide the assembly instructions:\n\nFor the Train Structure (left to right, bottom up):\n- Base: Two orange cylindrical wheels (block 14)\n- Middle layer: Yellow horizontal block (block 11) as the base\n- Upper layer: Blue cube (block 5), red cube (block 7), green block (block 8)\n- Top: Yellow curved piece (block 15)\n\nFor the Bridge Structure (bottom up):\n- Base: Two red arch pieces (blocks 1 and 2) connected by a red block\n- Middle: Red circular piece (block 4)\n- Top: Yellow horizontal blocks (blocks 10 and 12)\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14 (left wheel)\n    Step2: Move block with index 14 (right wheel)\n    Step3: Move block with index 11 (yellow base of train)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (blue cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 7 (red cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (green block)\n    Step7: Move block with index 15 (yellow curved top)\n    Step8: Move block with index 1 (left red arch)\n    Step9: Move block with index 2 (right red arch)\n    Step10: Move block with index 7 (red connecting block)\n    Step11: Move block with index 4 (red circular piece)\n    Step12: Move block with index 10 (left yellow top)\n    Step13: Move block with index 12 (right yellow top)\n}",

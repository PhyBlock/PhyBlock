House-like Structure:\n- Built on two blue cubic blocks as base\n- Yellow horizontal block on top of the blue blocks\n- Red arch-shaped structure with orange roof pieces\n- Total of 3 layers\n\n2. Vehicle-like Structure:\n- Two orange cylindrical blocks as wheels/base\n- Yellow horizontal block on top\n- Blue cubic block on top\n- Total of 2 layers\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n\nFor the House Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nFor the Vehicle Structure:\n{\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 3\n}\n\nThe total number of blocks used:\n- 2 blue cubes (index 3)\n- 1 yellow horizontal block (index 4)\n- 1 red arch piece (index 1)\n- 2 orange roof pieces (index 15, 16)\n- 2 orange cylinders (index 8)\n- 1 yellow horizontal block (index 7)\n- 1 blue cube (index 3)\n\nEach block is used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation. The assembly order ensures stability by building from bottom to top for both structures.",

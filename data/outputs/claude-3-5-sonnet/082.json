Base layer: Red tunnel pieces and orange ramps\n2. Middle layer: Red blocks forming circular opening\n3. Top layer: Yellow curved pieces and orange triangular roof pieces\n\nRequired Blocks and Assembly Order:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (red U-shaped piece, left side)\nStep3: Move block with index 3 (red U-shaped piece, right side)\nStep4: Move block with index 6 (yellow curved piece, left)\nStep5: Move block with index 7 (yellow curved piece, right)\nStep6: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular ramp, left)\nStep7: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular ramp, right)\nStep8: Move block with index 12 (orange triangular roof piece, front)\nStep9: Move block with index 12 (orange triangular roof piece, back)\n}\n\nThe construction follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the base tunnel piece, adding the side supports, then the yellow curved decorative elements, and finally the orange triangular pieces to complete the roof structure.",

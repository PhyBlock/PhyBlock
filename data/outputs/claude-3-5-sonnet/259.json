Left Structure:\n- 4 layers total\n- Red house-like shape on top\n- Two orange cylindrical pillars\n- Two yellow horizontal beams\n- Has an arched opening\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- 3 layers total\n- Red blocks with circular opening\n- Yellow horizontal beams\n- Red arched base\n- Has circular and arched openings\n\nLet me provide the assembly instructions for both structures:\n\nLeft Structure Assembly:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 (red arch left)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (red arch right)\nStep3: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal beam)\nStep4: Move block with index 10 (orange vertical cylinder)\nStep5: Move block with index 11 (orange vertical cylinder)\nStep6: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal beam)\nStep7: Move block with index 3 (red arch piece)\nStep8: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nRight Structure Assembly:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 (red arch left)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (red arch right)\nStep3: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal beam)\nStep4: Move block with index 4 (red circular opening)\nStep5: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal beam)\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence ensures stability by building from bottom to top, placing support structures before adding upper elements.",

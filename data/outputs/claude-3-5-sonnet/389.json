A mailbox-like structure (left):\n- Made of orange and red blocks with yellow tops\n- Has a cylindrical post (orange)\n- Red top section with two yellow curved tops\n- Orange square blocks at the base\n\n2. A house-like structure (right):\n- Has a triangular orange roof\n- Blue and green cube blocks for walls\n- Red arch at the bottom\n- Orange triangular ramps on sides\n\nLet me provide the assembly instructions for each structure:\n\nFor the Mailbox structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder for post)\n    Step2: Move block with index 2 (red U-shaped block for top)\n    Step3: Move block with index 9 (yellow curved block for left top)\n    Step4: Move block with index 9 (yellow curved block for right top)\n    Step5: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular block for left base)\n    Step6: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular block for right base)\n}\n\nFor the House structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch block for base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 (blue cube for right wall)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (green cube for left wall)\n    Step4: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular block for roof left)\n    Step5: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular block for roof right)\n    Step6: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular block for left ramp)\n    Step7: Move block with index 16 (orange triangular block for right ramp)\n}\n\nEach block must be used exactly as shown in the dictionary without rotation. The assembly order follows a bottom-to-top, support-first approach to ensure stability.",

A small house-like structure on the left (red base with orange roof)\n2. A taller tower-like structure on the right with:\n   - Two orange vertical cylinders\n   - A yellow horizontal support\n   - A red house-like structure with orange roof on top\n\nBlock count by colors:\n- Red blocks for the base structures\n- Yellow blocks for supports and dome\n- Orange blocks for cylinders and roofs\n\nAssembly Instructions:\nFor the left structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof piece)\n    Step3: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof piece)\n}\n\nFor the right structure:\n{\n    Step4: Move block with index 9 (orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step5: Move block with index 9 (orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal support)\n    Step7: Move block with index 2 (red arch base)\n    Step8: Move block with index 11 (yellow dome piece)\n    Step9: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof piece)\n}\n\nThe final structure matches the target image with all blocks in their correct orientations and positions. Each component is carefully selected from the block dictionary to match the exact shape, color, and orientation required.",

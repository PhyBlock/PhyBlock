A smaller structure (left) consisting of:\n   - A red arch base\n   - A blue cube\n   - A yellow semi-cylindrical block on top\n   - An orange triangular roof piece\n\n2. A larger structure (right) consisting of:\n   - Four red arch pieces forming a 2x2 grid\n   - Three yellow blocks forming a bridge/connection between the arches\n   - Two red rectangular blocks on top\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\n\nFor the smaller structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 (blue cube)\n    Step3: Move block with index 10 (yellow semi-cylinder)\n    Step4: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nFor the larger structure:\n{\n    Step5: Move block with index 2 (red arch - front left)\n    Step6: Move block with index 2 (red arch - front right)\n    Step7: Move block with index 2 (red arch - back left)\n    Step8: Move block with index 2 (red arch - back right)\n    Step9: Move block with index 9 (yellow rectangular block - horizontal bridge)\n    Step10: Move block with index 12 (yellow square block - left side)\n    Step11: Move block with index 12 (yellow square block - right side)\n    Step12: Move block with index 7 (red rectangular block - left top)\n    Step13: Move block with index 7 (red rectangular block - right top)\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to match exactly as they appear in the dictionary, maintaining their orientation and shape. No rotation of blocks is needed as the dictionary provides the exact orientations required for the construction.",

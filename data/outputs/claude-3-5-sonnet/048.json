Bottom: Green horizontal block (Block #2)\n2. Middle: Two yellow vertical blocks (Block #9 or #10) for sides\n3. Top: Green horizontal block (Block #2)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 (Place green horizontal block at bottom)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (Place yellow vertical block on left side)\n    Step3: Move block with index 9 (Place yellow vertical block on right side)\n    Step4: Move block with index 2 (Place green horizontal block at top)\n}\n\nThis will create the rectangular frame structure shown in the target image, with green blocks forming the top and bottom horizontal pieces and yellow blocks forming the vertical sides.",

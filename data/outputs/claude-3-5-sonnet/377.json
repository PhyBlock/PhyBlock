Left Structure:\n- Has 6 blocks total\n- 4 layers high\n- Contains blue, green, red, and yellow blocks\n- Has a house-like appearance with two blue blocks on top\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- Has 7 blocks total\n- Made of red, yellow, and orange blocks\n- Forms an arch or tunnel-like structure\n- Symmetrical design with triangular sides\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\n\nFor Left Structure (from bottom to top):\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 7 (yellow horizontal block for base)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (red U-shaped block)\nStep3: Move block with index 5 (green horizontal block)\nStep4: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\nStep5: Move block with index 4 (blue cube again)\nStep6: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof piece)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure (from bottom up):\n{\nStep7: Move block with index 1 (red arch piece for base)\nStep8: Move block with index 9 (yellow curved piece)\nStep9: Move block with index 9 (yellow curved piece again)\nStep10: Move block with index 13 (orange side piece)\nStep11: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular piece)\nStep12: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular piece again)\nStep13: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof piece)\n}\n\nThe blocks are used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation, and I've maintained the correct spatial relationships between all pieces to match the target image.",

Ground layer: Orange triangular/trapezoidal pieces forming the base and sides\n  2. Top layer: A blue cube in the center with orange triangular pieces completing the roof\n\nLooking at the block dictionary, I can identify the needed pieces:\n- Blue cube (index 1) for the center\n- Orange triangular/trapezoidal pieces (indices 13, 14, 15) for the sides and roof\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence will:\n1. Place the left base piece\n2. Place the right base piece\n3. Place the blue cube in the center\n4. Place the right roof piece\n5. Place the left roof piece\n\nThis will create the tunnel-like structure with the blue center and orange sides as shown in the target image.",

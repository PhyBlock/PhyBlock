A vertical tower-like structure with multiple layers\n2. A small house-like structure on the right\n\nLet me break down each structure:\n\nVertical Tower Structure:\n- 3 layers connected by yellow horizontal bars\n- Each layer contains:\n  * A green vertical block\n  * A red and blue cube combination\n- Total blocks: 3 yellow bars, 3 green blocks, 3 red cubes, 3 blue cubes\n\nSmall House Structure:\n- Red base with an arch\n- Yellow semi-circular tops\n- Orange triangular roof pieces\n\nLet me provide the assembly instructions for both structures:\n\nTower Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10 (Bottom yellow bar)\nStep2: Move block with index 7 (Green vertical block)\nStep3: Move block with index 5 (Red cube)\nStep4: Move block with index 3 (Blue cube)\nStep5: Move block with index 10 (Middle yellow bar)\nStep6: Move block with index 7 (Green vertical block)\nStep7: Move block with index 5 (Red cube)\nStep8: Move block with index 3 (Blue cube)\nStep9: Move block with index 10 (Top yellow bar)\nStep10: Move block with index 7 (Green vertical block)\nStep11: Move block with index 5 (Red cube)\nStep12: Move block with index 3 (Blue cube)\n}\n\nHouse Structure:\n{\nStep13: Move block with index 2 (Red arch base)\nStep14: Move block with index 11 (Yellow semi-circular piece)\nStep15: Move block with index 11 (Yellow semi-circular piece)\nStep16: Move block with index 15 (Orange triangle roof)\nStep17: Move block with index 15 (Orange triangle roof)\n}",

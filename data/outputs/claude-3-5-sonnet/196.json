Left section (like a locomotive):\n- Base: Blue blocks with yellow connector\n- Middle: Orange cylindrical tower with triangular supports\n- Top: Red block with yellow domed tops\n\n2. Right section (like train cars):\n- Base: Red arched blocks\n- Middle: Various colored blocks (blue, green, yellow, orange)\n- Top: Yellow domed pieces\n\nBlock count per layer:\n- Bottom layer: Blue blocks, red arched blocks\n- Middle layer: Yellow, orange, and colored cubic blocks\n- Top layer: Domed pieces and tall blocks\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 3 (blue cube - left base)\nStep2: Move block with index 6 (blue cube - left base)\nStep3: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal block - connector)\nStep4: Move block with index 1 (red arch - right base)\nStep5: Move block with index 1 (red arch - right base again)\nStep6: Move block with index 15 (orange triangle support)\nStep7: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle support)\nStep8: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder)\nStep9: Move block with index 3 (blue cube - right section)\nStep10: Move block with index 7 (green vertical block)\nStep11: Move block with index 9 (yellow vertical block)\nStep12: Move block with index 9 (yellow vertical block)\nStep13: Move block with index 4 (orange cube)\nStep14: Move block with index 2 (red top piece with curve)\nStep15: Move block with index 12 (yellow dome)\nStep16: Move block with index 12 (yellow dome)\nStep17: Move block with index 12 (yellow dome)\nStep18: Move block with index 12 (yellow dome)\n}",

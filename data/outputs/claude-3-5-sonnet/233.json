A chair-like structure consisting of:\n   - Two green vertical pillars as legs\n   - A yellow horizontal block as seat\n   - A stack of red and blue cubes with a yellow curved top as backrest\n2. A vehicle-like structure with:\n   - Two orange horizontal cylinders as base\n   - A yellow horizontal block on top\n   - A blue cube and yellow curved piece on top\n\nBlock Count: Approximately 10-11 blocks total\nLayers: Multiple layers in both structures\n\nAssembly Instructions:\nFor the chair structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4 (green vertical block, left leg)\n    Step2: Move block with index 4 (green vertical block, right leg)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal block for seat)\n    Step4: Move block with index 3 (red cube for backrest)\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (blue cube for backrest)\n    Step6: Move block with index 11 (yellow curved piece for top)\n}\n\nFor the vehicle structure:\n{\n    Step7: Move block with index 10 (orange horizontal cylinder, left)\n    Step8: Move block with index 10 (orange horizontal cylinder, right)\n    Step9: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal block for platform)\n    Step10: Move block with index 1 (blue cube)\n    Step11: Move block with index 11 (yellow curved piece for top)\n}\n\nThe blocks are chosen to match exactly the orientations shown in the dictionary, with no rotations needed. I've selected specific blocks that match both the shape and orientation requirements of the target structure.",

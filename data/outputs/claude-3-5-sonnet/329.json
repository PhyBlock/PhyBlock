Left Structure (Tower-like):\n- Two orange cylindrical pillars with yellow blocks on top\n- A red arch block and blue cube on the upper portion\n- Topped with an orange triangular roof\n\n2. Right Structure (Wall-like):\n- Two yellow horizontal blocks at top and bottom\n- Two green vertical blocks on the sides\n- Red and blue blocks in the center forming a pattern\n\nAnalysis of layers and blocks needed:\n\nFor the Left Structure (bottom to top):\n1. Two orange cylinders (Block #13)\n2. Two yellow horizontal blocks (Block #9)\n3. Red arch block (Block #1)\n4. Blue cube (Block #4)\n5. Orange triangular roof (Block #14)\n\nFor the Right Structure (bottom to top):\n1. Yellow horizontal block (Block #10)\n2. Two green vertical blocks (Block #6, #7)\n3. Red cube (Block #5)\n4. Blue cube (Block #4)\n5. Yellow horizontal block (Block #9)\n\nAssembly instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 7\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n}",

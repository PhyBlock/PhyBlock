A locomotive section with:\n   - Orange roof (triangular)\n   - Blue cube body\n   - Yellow rectangular base\n   - Two orange cylindrical wheels\n\n2. A wagon/carriage section with:\n   - Red arch blocks forming a tunnel-like structure\n   - Yellow rectangular base pieces\n   - Four red arch/support pieces\n\nTotal blocks used: approximately 12-13 blocks across 2-3 layers\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\nFor the locomotive:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nFor the wagon:\n{\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 4\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence starts from bottom to top, front to back:\n1. First placing the wheels (cylindrical blocks)\n2. Then the yellow base pieces\n3. Adding the blue cube body and orange triangular roof for the locomotive\n4. Finally constructing the arch/tunnel structure with the red blocks for the wagon section\n\nThis sequence ensures stability during construction and follows a logical building order from ground up.",

Orange cylindrical columns (2x)\n2. Green rectangular blocks (3x) as supporting elements\n3. Red arch structure on top\n4. Orange triangular/wedge pieces for slopes\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 9 (left orange cylinder)\nStep2: Move block with index 9 (right orange cylinder)\nStep3: Move block with index 6 (left vertical green block)\nStep4: Move block with index 8 (middle green block)\nStep5: Move block with index 6 (right vertical green block)\nStep6: Move block with index 1 (red arch piece)\nStep7: Move block with index 13 (left orange wedge)\nStep8: Move block with index 14 (center back orange wedge)\nStep9: Move block with index 15 (right orange wedge)\n}\n\nEach piece is selected to match the exact orientation as shown in the dictionary, and the assembly sequence builds from the ground up to create a stable structure. The cylindrical supports are placed first, followed by the green structural elements, then the red arch, and finally the orange wedge pieces that form the sloped elements.",

Bottom layer: Two yellow long blocks as foundation\n2. Middle layer: Three red blocks forming an arch\n3. Middle-top layer: One yellow horizontal block\n4. Upper layer: One blue cube and one red cube side by side\n5. Top layer: One green horizontal block and orange triangular roof\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 4\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 8\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe blocks are carefully selected to match both shape and orientation as shown in the dictionary. The assembly sequence starts from the bottom and works upward, ensuring stability during construction.",

Main train body (left side)\n2. Separate car unit (right side)\n\nBlock selection and assembly order from bottom to top, left to right:\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\nStep2: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\nStep3: Move block with index 2 (red curved piece)\nStep4: Move block with index 3 (red curved piece)\nStep5: Move block with index 5 (blue cube) - for front section\nStep6: Move block with index 12 (yellow half-cylinder)\nStep7: Move block with index 12 (yellow half-cylinder)\nStep8: Move block with index 11 (yellow tall block)\nStep9: Move block with index 11 (yellow tall block)\nStep10: Move block with index 8 (green horizontal block)\nStep11: Move block with index 9 (green vertical block)\nStep12: Move block with index 16 (orange/red triangular roof)\nStep13: Move block with index 5 (blue cube) - for separate car\nStep14: Move block with index 8 (green horizontal block)\nStep15: Move block with index 16 (orange/red triangular roof)\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence will create the complete structure as shown in the target image, maintaining all correct orientations and spatial relationships between blocks.",

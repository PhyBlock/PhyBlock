A horizontal green rectangular block as the base\n2. An orange wedge-shaped block on the left\n3. A blue cubic block and a yellow cubic block side by side\n4. A red U-shaped block on top of an orange cylinder\n\nRequired blocks from the dictionary and assembly order:\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 8 (green horizontal rectangle as base)\nStep2: Move block with index 15 (orange wedge)\nStep3: Move block with index 6 (blue cube)\nStep4: Move block with index 7 (yellow cube)\nStep5: Move block with index 13 (orange cylinder)\nStep6: Move block with index 3 (red U-shaped block)\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, ensuring stability throughout the construction process. Each block is selected to match the exact orientation shown in the target image, with no rotations needed.",

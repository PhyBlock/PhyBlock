Base: Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n2. Middle: Two green vertical rectangular blocks\n3. Upper middle: Two orange vertical cylinders with a yellow horizontal block on top\n4. Top: Orange triangular block with a yellow horizontal block beneath it\n5. Separate structure: Two orange cylinders supporting a yellow horizontal block\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7 (Base yellow horizontal block)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (Left green vertical block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 (Right green vertical block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 7 (Second layer yellow horizontal block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 9 (Left orange cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 9 (Right orange cylinder)\n    Step7: Move block with index 7 (Third layer yellow horizontal block)\n    Step8: Move block with index 14 (Orange triangular block)\n    Step9: Move block with index 4 (Top yellow horizontal block)\n    \n    For the separate structure:\n    Step10: Move block with index 10 (Left orange cylinder)\n    Step11: Move block with index 10 (Right orange cylinder)\n    Step12: Move block with index 8 (Top yellow horizontal block)\n}\n\nThe blocks are carefully selected to match the exact orientations shown in the dictionary, with no rotations needed.",

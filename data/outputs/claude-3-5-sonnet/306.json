Left Structure:\n- Has two blue cubes on top\n- A green horizontal block below\n- A red block with semicircle cutout\n- Yellow base block\n- Orange triangular block on the side\n\n2. Right Structure (taller):\n- Orange triangular block on top\n- Yellow horizontal block\n- Two green vertical blocks\n- Yellow horizontal block\n- Red block with circular cutout\n- Yellow base block\n\nThe structure uses multiple layers and various block types including cubes, rectangular blocks, blocks with cutouts, and triangular blocks.\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary with indices:\n- Blue cubes (index 4)\n- Green vertical blocks (index 7)\n- Green horizontal block (index 6)\n- Red blocks with cutouts (indices 1, 2)\n- Yellow horizontal blocks (indices 8, 9)\n- Yellow vertical blocks (indices 10, 11)\n- Orange triangular blocks (indices 13, 14, 15, or 16)\n\nAssembly Order:\nFor both structures, we build from bottom up:\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal base - left structure)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (red block with cutout - left structure)\nStep3: Move block with index 6 (green horizontal block - left structure)\nStep4: Move block with index 4 (blue cube - left structure front)\nStep5: Move block with index 4 (blue cube - left structure back)\nStep6: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle - left structure side)\nStep7: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal base - right structure)\nStep8: Move block with index 1 (red block with circular cutout - right structure)\nStep9: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal block - right structure middle)\nStep10: Move block with index 7 (green vertical block - right structure front)\nStep11: Move block with index 7 (green vertical block - right structure back)\nStep12: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal block - right structure top)\nStep13: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle - right structure top)\n}",

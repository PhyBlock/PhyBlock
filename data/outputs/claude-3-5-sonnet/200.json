A house-like structure with:\n- Bottom layer: Red arch piece with yellow blocks on sides\n- Middle layer: Green and blue blocks\n- Top layer: Orange triangular roof pieces\n2. A vehicle-like structure with:\n- Base: Yellow half-cylinder wheels\n- Body: Yellow rectangular blocks\n- Top: Orange triangular piece\n\nTotal number of layers:\n- House structure: 3 layers\n- Vehicle structure: 2 layers\n\nBlock selection and assembly order:\nFor the house structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2 (red arch piece)\nStep2: Move block with index 6 (yellow cube, left side)\nStep3: Move block with index 6 (yellow cube, right side)\nStep4: Move block with index 5 (green cube)\nStep5: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\nStep6: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle, left roof)\nStep7: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle, right roof)\n}\n\nFor the vehicle structure:\n{\nStep8: Move block with index 11 (yellow half-cylinder, left wheel)\nStep9: Move block with index 11 (yellow half-cylinder, right wheel)\nStep10: Move block with index 7 (yellow horizontal rectangle)\nStep11: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle roof)\n}\n\nThe construction can be built starting with either the house or vehicle structure since they are separate pieces. I've listed them in a logical order starting with the house, then the vehicle.",

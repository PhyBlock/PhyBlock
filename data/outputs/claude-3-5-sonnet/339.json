Left Building:\n   - Red arch base\n   - Green rectangular block above\n   - Blue cube on top\n   - Orange triangular roof\n\n2. Middle Building:\n   - Orange vertical cylinder\n   - Orange triangular roof\n\n3. Train Section:\n   - Two orange horizontal cylinders as wheels/base\n   - Yellow rectangular block on top\n   - Blue cube as the cabin\n   - Yellow semicircular piece as the top\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 7 (green rectangular block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\n    Step5: Move block with index 9 (orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\n    Step7: Move block with index 10 (orange horizontal cylinder)\n    Step8: Move block with index 10 (orange horizontal cylinder)\n    Step9: Move block with index 8 (yellow rectangular block)\n    Step10: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step11: Move block with index 11 (yellow semicircular piece)\n}\n\nEach block has been selected to match the exact orientation and color as shown in the dictionary image, without any rotations.",

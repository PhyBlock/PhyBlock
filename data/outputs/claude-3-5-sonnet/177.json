Left Structure (Castle-like):\n- Has 4 layers\n- Built with red arches at base\n- Yellow horizontal block and green cubes in middle\n- Topped with a red house with orange roof\n\n2. Right Structure (Wall-like):\n- Has 3 layers\n- Yellow blocks at top and bottom\n- Green vertical blocks on sides\n- Red and blue blocks in center\n\nTotal Block Count: Approximately 13-14 blocks\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 2 (red arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 6 (green cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 6 (green cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 7 (red cube)\n    Step7: Move block with index 14 (orange roof piece)\n    Step8: Move block with index 15 (orange roof piece)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\n    Step9: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal block)\n    Step10: Move block with index 9 (green vertical block)\n    Step11: Move block with index 7 (red block)\n    Step12: Move block with index 5 (blue block)\n    Step13: Move block with index 9 (green vertical block)\n    Step14: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal block)\n}\n\nEach structure can be built independently as they are separate. The steps are organized from bottom to top for stable construction.",

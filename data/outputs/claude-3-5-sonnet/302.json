Two green vertical blocks (pieces #5 and #6) for the base\n2. One yellow horizontal block (piece #10) as the bridge\n3. One orange cylinder (piece #11) \n4. One yellow cap (piece #12)\n\nFor the right structure:\n1. Two red arch blocks (pieces #1 and #2) for the base\n2. One yellow horizontal block (piece #9)\n3. One yellow cap (piece #12)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 9\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n}\n\nNote: The yellow cap (piece #12) is used twice, once for each structure. The steps are ordered from bottom to top, left structure first, then right structure.",

Left Structure:\n- Bottom layer: Blue cube, red arch block, and green cube\n- Top layer: Yellow rectangular block with an orange triangular roof\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- Bottom: Two orange cylindrical pillars\n- Middle layer: Yellow rectangular blocks and red arch block\n- Top layer: Blue cube\n- Very top: Orange triangular roof on top of orange cylinder\n\nTotal blocks used and layer arrangement shows careful stacking with blocks supporting each other appropriately.\n\nBlock Selection from Dictionary and Assembly Order:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 6 (Blue cube)\nStep2: Move block with index 1 (Red arch)\nStep3: Move block with index 7 (Green cube)\nStep4: Move block with index 11 (Yellow rectangular block)\nStep5: Move block with index 15 (Orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\nStep6: Move block with index 12 (Orange cylinder)\nStep7: Move block with index 12 (Orange cylinder again)\nStep8: Move block with index 11 (Yellow rectangular block)\nStep9: Move block with index 2 (Red arch)\nStep10: Move block with index 11 (Yellow rectangular block)\nStep11: Move block with index 6 (Blue cube)\nStep12: Move block with index 12 (Orange cylinder)\nStep13: Move block with index 14 (Orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThis sequence ensures stable construction of both structures using the exact blocks as shown in the dictionary, maintaining their proper orientations and positions.",

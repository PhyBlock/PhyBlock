Left Building:\n- Has a house-like shape with a triangular roof\n- Contains red arched blocks at the base\n- Has yellow, green, blue, and orange blocks\n- 3-4 layers high\n\n2. Right Building:\n- Taller structure with vertical green blocks\n- Yellow horizontal block on top\n- Red arched blocks at the base\n- 3-4 layers high\n\nBlock Count and Layer Analysis:\n- Multiple red arch blocks (indices 1, 2, 3) form the foundation\n- Cubic blocks in various colors (green, blue, yellow) for walls\n- Orange triangular blocks (indices 13-16) for roofing\n- Rectangular blocks (indices 8, 9, 11) for horizontal elements\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 3\nStep4: Move block with index 1\nStep5: Move block with index 6\nStep6: Move block with index 7\nStep7: Move block with index 5\nStep8: Move block with index 4\nStep9: Move block with index 13\nStep10: Move block with index 14\nStep11: Move block with index 10\nStep12: Move block with index 10\nStep13: Move block with index 11\nStep14: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nThe blocks should be placed from bottom to top, starting with the foundation arches, then the wall blocks, and finally the roof elements. The assembly order ensures stability and proper alignment of all components.",

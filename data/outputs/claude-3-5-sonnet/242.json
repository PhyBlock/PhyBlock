A vehicle-like structure (left):\n- Two orange cylinders as wheels (block 11)\n- Yellow rectangular platform with rounded top (blocks 9 and 12)\n- Blue cube on top (block 3)\n\n2. A building-like structure (right):\n- Red U-shaped base (block 1)\n- Orange cylinder as support (block 10)\n- Two yellow rounded top pieces (block 12)\n\n3. A geometric composition:\n- Green base (block 5)\n- Yellow cube (block 4)\n- Blue cube (block 3)\n- Orange triangular piece (block 15)\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 5\n    Step11: Move block with index 4\n    Step12: Move block with index 3\n    Step13: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nThis sequence will create all three structures from left to right, building from bottom to top for each construction.",

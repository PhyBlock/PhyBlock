Start with the bottom yellow horizontal piece (block 14)\n2. Add the left green vertical piece (block 9)\n3. Add the right green vertical piece (block 10)\n4. Add the red pieces to form the circular opening:\n   - Top left piece (block 1)\n   - Top right piece (block 2)\n   - Middle left piece (block 5)\n   - Middle right piece (block 6)\n   - Bottom left piece (block 3)\n   - Bottom right piece (block 4)\n5. Add the top yellow horizontal piece (block 14)\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly instructions in the required format:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 3\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n}",

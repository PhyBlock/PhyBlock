A table-like structure with:\n   - 4 orange cylindrical legs\n   - A yellow rectangular top\n   - A tall orange cylindrical column on top\n   - A yellow semi-cylindrical cap at the very top\n\n2. A separate ground pattern made of:\n   - Orange triangular/wedge pieces\n   - Blue rectangular pieces\n   - One green square piece in the center\n\nBlock count and layers:\n- Ground pattern: 7 blocks (1 layer)\n- Table structure: 7 blocks (3 layers)\nTotal: 14 blocks\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder - front left leg)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder - front right leg)\n    Step3: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder - back left leg)\n    Step4: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder - back right leg)\n    Step5: Move block with index 6 (yellow rectangular top)\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder - vertical column)\n    Step7: Move block with index 10 (yellow semi-cylindrical cap)\n    Step8: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle - left)\n    Step9: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle - right)\n    Step10: Move block with index 4 (blue rectangle - left)\n    Step11: Move block with index 4 (blue rectangle - right)\n    Step12: Move block with index 1 (green square - center)\n    Step13: Move block with index 14 (orange thin piece - left)\n    Step14: Move block with index 14 (orange thin piece - right)\n}\n\nThe assembly order starts from the bottom up for the table structure, then creates the ground pattern from left to right.",

Left section: A red arch structure with yellow support\n  2. Middle section: Red arches connecting to the right\n  3. Right section: A house-like structure with green, blue, and orange blocks\n\nLayer breakdown:\n- Bottom layer: Red arch blocks forming the base\n- Second layer: Yellow long blocks as support/platform\n- Third layer: Green, blue, and additional red blocks\n- Top layer: Orange triangular roof piece\n\nBlock selection and assembly order:\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (red arch)\nStep3: Move block with index 2 (red arch)\nStep4: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\nStep5: Move block with index 9 (yellow long)\nStep6: Move block with index 10 (yellow long)\nStep7: Move block with index 11 (yellow long)\nStep8: Move block with index 3 (red arch piece)\nStep9: Move block with index 4 (red arch piece)\nStep10: Move block with index 5 (green cube)\nStep11: Move block with index 5 (green cube)\nStep12: Move block with index 7 (blue cube)\nStep13: Move block with index 7 (blue cube)\nStep14: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular)\n}\n\nThe assembly builds from left to right, bottom to top, ensuring stability throughout the construction process. Each block is used exactly as shown in the dictionary without rotation.",

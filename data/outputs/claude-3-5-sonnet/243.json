A tower-like structure on the left with:\n   - An orange/red house-like top\n   - Two orange cylindrical pillars\n   - Two yellow horizontal supports\n\n2. A train-like structure on the right with:\n   - Multiple blocks arranged in varying colors (blue, green, yellow, red)\n   - Two red arches at the base\n   - Various cubes and rectangles on top\n\nLayer Analysis:\n- Bottom layer: Red arches, green blocks\n- Middle layer: Cylindrical and cubic blocks\n- Top layer: Vertical blocks and cubes\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal support - bottom left)\n    Step2: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder - left pillar)\n    Step3: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder - right pillar)\n    Step4: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal support - top)\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (red arch - leftmost)\n    Step6: Move block with index 2 (red arch - right)\n    Step7: Move block with index 11 (yellow half-cylinder)\n    Step8: Move block with index 12 (yellow half-cylinder)\n    Step9: Move block with index 3 (blue cube)\n    Step10: Move block with index 9 (yellow vertical block)\n    Step11: Move block with index 6 (green vertical block)\n    Step12: Move block with index 7 (green horizontal block)\n    Step13: Move block with index 5 (red cube)\n    Step14: Move block with index 15 (orange roof piece)\n    Step15: Move block with index 16 (orange roof piece)\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the ground up, ensuring stability and proper placement of all components.",

Left Structure (appears to be a character-like figure):\n- Base: Yellow rectangular block\n- Middle: Red U-shaped block with green block on top\n- Top: Two blue cubic blocks side by side\n- Side: Orange triangular pieces forming a wing-like shape\n\n2. Right Structure (appears to be a cactus-like form):\n- Base: Green horizontal block\n- Middle: Orange cylindrical block\n- Top: Two vertical green blocks forming a U-shape\n\nLet me provide the assembly steps for both structures:\n\nFor the Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (yellow rectangular base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (red U-shaped block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (green rectangular block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 2 (blue cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 2 (second blue cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular piece)\n    Step7: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular piece)\n}\n\nFor the Right Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4 (green horizontal base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (orange cylindrical block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 5 (green vertical block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 6 (green vertical block)\n}\n\nThe structures can be built independently of each other, but I've presented them in a logical bottom-to-top assembly order.",

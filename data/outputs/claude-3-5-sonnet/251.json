A tall tower structure with multiple layers consisting of:\n- Base: Red blocks with three arches\n- Middle: Red block with single arch and green blocks\n- Top: Yellow horizontal block with orange triangular roof\n\n2. A smaller structure with:\n- Base: Red and orange blocks\n- Middle: Green horizontal block\n- Top: Orange triangular roof\n\nLet me break down the assembly steps for both structures:\n\nFor the tall tower:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 2\nStep4: Move block with index 3\nStep5: Move block with index 9\nStep6: Move block with index 9\nStep7: Move block with index 11\nStep8: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nFor the smaller structure:\n{\nStep9: Move block with index 6\nStep10: Move block with index 5\nStep11: Move block with index 10\nStep12: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe structure uses blocks in their exact orientations as shown in the dictionary, and I've maintained the proper spatial relationships between blocks. The assembly sequence starts from the bottom and works upward for stability.\n\nWould you like me to provide any additional details about specific aspects of the construction or clarify any part of the assembly sequence?",

A larger structure (right)\n\nLet me break down each structure:\n\nSmaller Structure (Left):\n- 5 blocks total\n- 3 layers\n- Base: 2 blue cube blocks\n- Middle: 1 yellow rectangular block\n- Top: Red arch block with orange triangular roof\n\nLarger Structure (Right):\n- 7 blocks total\n- 4 layers\n- Base: 1 yellow rectangular block\n- Second layer: Red circular tube block\n- Third layer: Red cube block, blue cube block, and green rectangular block\n- Top: Orange triangular roof\n\nAssembly instructions for the smaller structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nAssembly instructions for the larger structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe blocks are carefully selected to match both the shape and orientation as shown in the block dictionary. Note that some blocks (like index 3 for blue cubes) are used multiple times in the construction.",

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The target image shows two separate structures.\n    *   The structure on the left consists of 5 blocks. It has two layers.\n    * The structure on the right consists of 3 blocks. It also has two layers.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   Two orange arch-like blocks form the base.\n        *    Two orange triangular prism blocks is on top of each arch-like block.\n        *   One green rectangular block spans across the top, resting on the two arched blocks.\n\n    *    **Right Structure:**\n        *   One red arch-like block form the base.\n        *   Two red triangular prism is on the top of arch-like block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   **Left structure:**\n    *    Two of block index 2 (orange arch)\n    *   Two of block index 14 (orange triangular prism).\n    *   One of block index 7 (green rectangular, horizontal).\n* **Right Structure:**\n    *   One of block index 1 (red arch)\n    *   Two of block index 16(red triangular prism)\n\n**Needed Block Indices List:** 1, 2, 2, 7, 14, 14, 16, 16.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\nSummary: first construct left structure, then assemble the right one.\n"

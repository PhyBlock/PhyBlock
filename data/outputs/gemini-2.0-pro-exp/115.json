            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks.  It has two primary layers: a base layer and a top layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** The base layer is formed by three triangular blocks. Two orange triangular blocks form what looks like a large triangle/pyramid shape, pointing away from the viewer, when viewed from above. There is a blue triangular block in between, touching the other two orange blocks.\n    *   **Top Layer:** A green rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the base layer, bridging all three blocks (specifically on the two orange triangular blocks).\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Two Orange Triangular Blocks (pointing away from the camera): Looking at the dictionary, the blocks that match the required orientation are indices **11** and **12**.\n*    One Blue Triangular Blocks (pointing away from the camera): Looking at the dictionary, the blocks that match the required orientation are index **1**.\n*   One Green Rectangular Block (horizontal): The correct block is index **6**.\n\nTherefore, the list of block indices is: **1, 11, 12, 6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n**Explanation of steps:**\n1. Place the first orange triangular block (11).\n2. Place the second orange triangle block (12) next to the first block.\n3. Place the Blue triangular blocks (1) in front of the junction of block 11 and 12.\n4.  Place the horizontal green rectangular block (6) on top of the three triangular blocks, spanning them.\n"

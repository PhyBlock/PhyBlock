Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks. It has a base layer and a few blocks stacked/arranged on top, with the tallest point being two layers high (the green blocks and cylinders, plus the orange triangle on top).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There are two orange triangular prism blocks forming the \"base\" of the roof on opposite ends.\n    *   There are two green rectangular prism blocks standing vertically, one adjacent to each of the orange triangle base blocks.\n    *    There are two orange cyclinders between the green blocks.\n    *   There is one orange triangular prism block on top of the two cyclinders, forming the top of the \"roof\".\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two green rectangular prisms, vertically oriented: Block Index **3** (need two of these)\n*   Two orange cylinders, vertically oriented: Block Index **5** (need two of these)\n*   Three orange triangular prisms. Two oriented at ground level: Block Index **12** (need two of these). One on top, Block Index **11**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n\n}\n```\nExplanation of assembly:\n1.  Place the first orange triangle.\n2.  Place one of the Green blocks next to that first orange triangle.\n3.  Place the first orange cyclinder.\n4.  Place the second orange cyclinder.\n5.  Place the second Green block.\n6.  Place the second orange triangle.\n7.  Place the roof, that being the last orange triangle on top of the cyclinders.\n"

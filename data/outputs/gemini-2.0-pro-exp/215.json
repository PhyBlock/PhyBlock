Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. I will analyze the structure on the right, as it is more complex. Here’s a breakdown:\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 9 blocks. It has two layers.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Comprises 5 blocks: a central red tunnel-like block, two orange triangular prism blocks (one on the left and the one on the right) and two cube blocks (yellow and green)\n    *   **Layer 2 (Top):** There are 4 blocks on the top. Two cube blocks (Blue color), and two orange triangular prism blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** The red tunnel block is at the center. One yellow block is beside it. One orange triangular prism is connected to the left and right sides of the tunnel block, and one green block is nearby the tunnel and orange block.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two blue blocks are on top of the red tunnel block. There are two triangular prism blocks. They are on the top of the first layer orange triangular blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary image:\n\n*   **Block 1:** (Red tunnel) - Quantity: 1\n*   **Block 7:** (Yellow Cube) - Quantity: 1\n*   **Block 6:** (Green Cube)- Quantity: 1\n*   **Block 16:** (Orange triangular prism) - Quantity: 2\n*   **Block 8:** (Blue Cube) - Quantity: 2\n*   **Block 12:** (Orange triangular prism) - Quantity: 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere’s a inferred step by step assembly guide.\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 16\n    Step3: Move block with index 16\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n"

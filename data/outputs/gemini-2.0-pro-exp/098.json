Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure is composed of 6 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure can be conceptually divided into three layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** Two triangular prism, orange blocks, that is mirrored.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** One cylinder block, stands vertically.\n    *   **Top Layer:** Consist of one red \"arch\" block and two yellow \"half-cylinder/roof\" blocks.\n*    **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The two orange blocks are on the first Layer, and facing outwards.\n    * The cylinder is on the center of second layer.\n    *    The red \"arch\" block is placed on the third layer, bridging what would be the gap.\n    *    The two yellow \"half-cylinder\" blocks sit atop the red arch, one on each side, forming a symmetrical top.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   Block 8 (Orange cylinder)\n*   Block 2 (Red arch)\n*    Block 11 (Yellow roof/half-cylinder) - Used twice.\n*   Block 14 (Orange triangular) - Used twice.\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 11 blocks. It is made of multiple layers. Broadly speaking, there is a base layer, a middle layer and top layers on the structures.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There are two separate constructions.\n    *   The structure on the left has two orange cylinderical blocks in the first layer. A yellow rectangular block on top of it in layer two. On top of that, in layer 3, one orange cylinderical block and a small yellow curve block on top of it.\n    *    The structure on the right has one red arch block in the first layer. On top, in the second layer, are one green rectangular block, one orange cylinder, and one yellow rectangle block. In layer 3, there is one block with the shape of a roof, and one yellow rectangular block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Left Structure:**\n    *   Two Orange Cylinders: 9 (used twice)\n    *   One Yellow Rectangle: 5\n    *\tOne orange cylinder: 9\n    *\tSmall yellow curve: 12\n*  **Right Structure:**\n\t* Red Arch: 1\n    *   Green Rectangle: 3\n    *   Orange cylinder: 9\n    *   Yellow rectangle: 6\n    *   Yellow rectangle: 8\n    *\tOrange Roof: 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 9\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n   Step10: Move block with index 16\n   Step11: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n"

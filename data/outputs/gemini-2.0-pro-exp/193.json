            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the building instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure appears to be built with 6 blocks. It has roughly three layers:\n    *   Base Layer: Four orange triangular/wedge-shaped blocks forming a square-like base, with gaps in the corners.\n    *   Middle Layer: A blue rectangular block standing vertically, centered on top of the base layer.\n    *    Top Layer: orange triangular/wedge-shaped block, on top of the blue block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The four orange blocks in the base are arranged to point outwards, with their slanted edges facing upwards and inwards.\n    *   The blue rectangular block is centered on the base layer.\n    *    orange triangular/wedge-shaped block, is on the top of the blue one.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 7 blocks and has four layers:\n    *   Base Layer: A single yellow rectangular block laid horizontally.\n    *   Second Layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically, positioned on top of the base layer.\n    *   Third Layer: Two green rectangular blocks stand vertically, adjacent the orange cylindrical.\n    *   Forth Layer: A single yellow rectangular block laid horizontally, on the top of green blocks.\n    *   Top Layer: An orange triangular prism.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The cylinders rest on top of the yellow rectangular base.\n    *  The two green rectangular block are between the yellow ones.\n    *   The top orange triangle rests on the upper yellow rectangular block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Orange wedge/triangle: Block index 14 (x4), Block index 11(x1)\n*   Blue rectangular block: Block index 2 (x1)\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Yellow Rectangular block: Block index 9 (x2)\n*   Orange Cylindrical Block: Block index 10 (x2)\n*   Green rectangular block: Block index 5(x2)\n*  Orange triangular prism: Block index 16(x1)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n**Structure 2**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n\n}\n```\n"

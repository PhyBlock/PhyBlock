            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the building steps.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 5 blocks. It appears to have two layers, the ground layer, and what's build on top of the base.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There's a green cube as the central base.\n    *   An orange triangular prism is placed at the bottom left, on the ground\n    *   An orange rectangular block is place at the bottom, right, on the ground.\n    *   An orange, bigger, triangular prism sits on top of the green cube.\n    *    An orange half-cylinder/roof piece sits atop the larger prism.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 6 blocks. It has two visible layers (ground and upper).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two green rectangular pillars form the base, standing upright.\n    *   A long yellow rectangular block connects the two green pillars, forming a bridge.\n    *   One red block is placed on top of the horizontal yellow block.\n    *    One blue block is placed on top of the red block.\n    *   A yellow half-cylinder/roof is placed on top of the blue block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Green Cube: Index 2\n*   Orange small triangular prism: Index 15\n*   Orange Rectangular Block: Index 11\n*    Orange big triangular prism: Index 14\n*   Orange Roof: Index 10\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Green Rectangular Pillar (x2): Index 4, 4\n*   Long Yellow Rectangular Block: Index 5\n*    Red block: Index 3\n*   Blue Block: Index 1\n*   Yellow Roof: Index 6\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence, presented in the required format:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 15\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 4\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 3\n   Step10: Move block with index 1\n   Step11: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n"

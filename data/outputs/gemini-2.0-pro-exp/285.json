Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 6 blocks, arranged in what can conceptually be seen as three layers.\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Two orange cylindrical blocks, positioned horizontally and parallel to each other, forming a base.\n    *   Layer 2 (Middle): One green rectangular block, placed horizontally on top of, and bridging, the two cylindrical blocks.\n    *   Layer 3 (Top): One Red rectangular block, and one Blue rectangular block stacked on top of the green rectangle, forming a vertical tower.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two orange cylinders are parallel and close together, acting as a base.\n    *   The green rectangle is centered on top of the cylinders.\n    *   The red and Blue block is stacked vertically, centered on the green rectangle, with the red block directly on the green, and the blue on top of the red.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 4 blocks. It is effectively one layer high, though the blocks have different heights.\n*    Layer 1: made by four blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two orange triangular prism blocks form a sloped roof.\n    *   Two short rectangular blocks(orange, blue), are beside each of the triangular prism block.\n    *   one blue short rectangular is positioned upright.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Orange Cylinders (2): Block index **9** (used twice)\n*   Green Rectangle: Block index **4**\n*   Red Rectangle: Block index **2**\n*   Blue Rectangle: Block index **1**\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Orange Triangular Prisms (2): Block index **16** (used twice)\n*   Orange short Rectangular: Block index **11**\n*   Blue short Rectangular: Block index **1**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n**Structure 2:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 16\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 16\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n"

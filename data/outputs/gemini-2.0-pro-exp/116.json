Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 4 blocks. It has two layers: a base layer made of three blocks, and a top layer consisting of one block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer has a central red arch block.\n    *   Two orange ramp/wedge blocks are on either side of the arch, forming a continuous slope with the arch.\n    *   The second layer is a single, horizontally-oriented, green rectangular block that rests on top of the arch and is centered.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   One red arch block (orientation matching the target).\n*   Two orange wedge blocks.\n*  One Horizontally oriented green rectangular block.\n\nLooking at the Block Dictionary image, these correspond to:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   Red arch: Block 2\n    *   Orange Wedge: Block 13, and Block 16\n    *  Green Retangle: Block 8\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nThe assembly is done by forming layer by layer.\n* Form the first layer by placing block 2 at the center, block 13 on the left of block 2, and block 16 on the right of block 2.\n* Form the sencond layer by placing block 8 on the top of block 2.\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 16\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n"

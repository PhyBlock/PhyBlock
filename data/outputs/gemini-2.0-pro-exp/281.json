Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 17 blocks, arranged in multiple layers. It can be broadly divided into two sections: a \"house-like\" structure on the left and a \"tower with arches\" on the right.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **House Structure (Left):**\n        *   Base Layer: A red arch, a yellow square, and an orange triangular prism.\n        *   Second layer: A red half cylinder on the arch, an orange triangular prism beside it, and another yellow block.\n        *   Third layer:A green cube and another orange triangular prism.\n        *   Top Layer: A Blue cube and an orange triangular prism forming the \"roof\".\n    *    **Tower Structure(Right)**\n        *   Base Layer: Two red arches, bridged by a green rectangular block.\n        *    Second Layer: two green blocks standing upright on the green rectangular block.\n        *    Third Layer: A Yellow rectangular block on the two green upright blocks.\n        *    Top layer: An orange triangular prism.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   Red Arch: 1 (x3)\n*   Yellow Square: 7 (x2)\n*  Orange triangular prism: 13(x1), 14 (x2), 15(x1)\n*   Red Half Cylinder: 2 (x1)\n* Green Cube: 5 (x1)\n* Blue Cube:4 (x1)\n*   Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): 9 (x1)\n*   Green Rectangular Block (Vertical): 10 (x2)\n* Yellow Rectangular Block(Horizontal): 11 (x1)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 14\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 5\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 15\n    Step11: Move block with index 1\n    Step12: Move block with index 1\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n    Step14: Move block with index 10\n    Step15: Move block with index 10\n    Step16: Move block with index 11\n    Step17: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 7 blocks and appears to have two layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Four orange cylinders (block 8) are standing vertically, supporting a long yellow rectangular block.\n    *   **Layer 2:** The yellow rectangular block (block 7) from layer 1 has two block on top of it. A tall orange Cylinder(block 8) is placed at the far end. Besides that, their is a orange triangular prism (block 15). On top of the tall orange cylinder, there is another yellow half cylinder(block 10).\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure comprises 5 blocks, seemingly in a single layer, although the green blocks are stacked on the red ones.\n*    **Layer1:**\n    * Two red arch shape blocks are used (block 2)\n*    **Layer2**\n    *Three green blocks(block 6) are placed on top of the red arch.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 8 (Orange Cylinder): 5 times\n    *   Block 7 (Yellow Rectangular Block): 1 time\n    *    Block 15 (Triangular Prism): 1 time\n    *   Block 10 (Yellow half cylinder): 1 time\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 2 (Red Arch): 2 times\n    *   Block 6 (Green Rectangular Block): 3 times\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n**Structure 1**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n**Structure 2**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of two distinct parts.\n    *   The taller structure on the left uses 7 blocks and has 4 layers.\n    *   The structure on the right has 3 block in 2 layers.\n*    Total blocks used = 10\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Two red arch-shaped blocks form the base, placed parallel.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A yellow, rectangular block placed horizontally on top of, and spans across both arch blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A green cube block and a blue cube, side by side. The green cube on the left.\n    *   **Layer 4:** An orange roof-like, two sided triangular block, places on top of green and blue cube.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):**\n    *   **Layer 1:** one red arch-shaped block form the base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two yellow and blue rectangular block form, combined. The structure is such that the left half part is blue and right half is yellow.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed from the provided block dictionary:\n\n*   Three Red Arch: Block Index `2` (Three times)\n*   One Yellow Rectangular (horizontal): Block Index `10`\n*    One Yellow Rectangular (horizontal): Block Index `12`\n*   One Green Cube: Block Index `7`\n*   Two Blue Cube: Block Index `6` (Two times)\n*    One yellow Rectangular(Horizontal): Block Index `9`\n*   One Orange two sided triangular: Block Index `15`\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence, using two parts:\n\n**Part 1**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n**Part 2**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n     Step3: Move block with index 6\n\n}\n```\nFinal Answer: The code combines step from Part 1 and 2:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 9\n     Step9: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n"

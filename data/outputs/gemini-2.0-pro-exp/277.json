Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target structure I need to focus on is the one on the *right* side of the main image (the one that looks like a house). The structure on the left is a distractor.\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The \"house\" structure consists of 5 blocks, arranged in 3 layers.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two blue rectangular blocks, laid flat, with a gap between them.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** One yellow rectangular block, laid flat, bridging the gap between the two blue blocks below.\n    * **Layer 3(Top):** One red arch, and, One orange two-side slope.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two blue blocks in the bottom layer are parallel to each other and have a space between them approximately equal to their width.\n    *   The yellow block in the second layer sits centered on top of the blue blocks, covering parts of both and spanning the gap.\n    *   The Red Arch is put on the yellow block.\n    *   The orange two-side slope is put on the yellow block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks from the block dictionary image:\n\n*   **Block 5:** Blue rectangular block (flat orientation) - Need two of these.\n*   **Block 6:** Yellow rectangular block (flat orientation).\n*    **Block 2:** Red Arch.\n*   **Block 13:** Orange two-side slope.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 5, 5, 6, 2, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence, using the specified output format:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Assembly order**\n1. Place one of the blue block(index 5).\n2. Place the other blue block(index 5), parallel near the first blue block with a space between them.\n3. Place the yellow block(index 6) on the top of two blue block, centralizing.\n4. Place the red Arch(index 2) on the top of the yellow block.\n5. Place the orange two-side slope(index 13) on the top of the yellow block.\n"

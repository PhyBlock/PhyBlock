            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the images and provide the building instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures. Let's analyze them separately:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left - Giraffe-like structure):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   There are 10 blocks in total.\n    *   It's difficult to define strict \"layers\" due to the irregular shape, but we can consider a base, a middle, and a top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base:** Four cylindrical blocks (orange) form the legs, standing upright.\n    *   **Middle:** A long yellow rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the four cylinders. One blue rectangular block and one orange triangle are on the yellow block.\n    *  **Top:** One orange triangle,one blue rectanglar block and one yellow half-cylinder block stacked on the yellow block\n\n**Structure 2 (Right - House-like structure):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   There are 6 blocks in total.\n    *   There are 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** Two rectangular blocks, one orange and one blue, positioned side-by-side.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Two rectangular blocks are on the buttom layer. One is orange, one is blue. One green rectanglar block is above the buttom layer.\n    * **Top Layer:** Two triangle shape blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1 (Giraffe):**\n\n*   Index 10: Four blocks (for the legs)\n*   Index 9: One block (for the horizontal body)\n*  Index 1: One block\n* Index 3: One block\n*   Index 11: One block (for the head)\n*   Index 15: Two blocks\n\n**Structure 2 (House):**\n\n*   Index 3: Two blocks (for the orange bottom)\n*  Index 1: Two block (for the blue bottom)\n*  Index 7: One block.\n* Index 14: Two block.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n**Structure 1 (Giraffe):**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 3\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n  Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n**Structure 2 (House):**\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2:Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4:Move block with index 1\n   Step5:Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\nStep7: Move block with index 14\n}\n"

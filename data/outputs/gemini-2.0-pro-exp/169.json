Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 15 blocks. It has a base layer, a middle layer made of arches and small blocks, and small blocks on the top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer**: Four large, red, bridge-like blocks form the foundation.\n    *   **Middle Layer**: Green and yellow arches sitting on top of the big red bridges. Two blue cubes, two orange house roofs, one tall yellow rectangle, one short green rectangle, and one yellow semi-circle shape.\n    * **Top layer**: There are some blocks stacked in this structure, orange house roofs placed on the blue cubes.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are needed:\n\n*   1 (Red Bridge): 4 times\n*   2 (Blue Cube): 2 times\n*   3 (Small green rectangle): 1\n*   8 (Short yellow rectangle): 1 time\n*   9 (Yellow tall rectangle): 1 Time\n*   11: (Yellow Arch): 2 times\n*   14, 15 (Orange roofs): 2 x 2 = 4 times.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 3\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 9\n    Step13: Move block with index 2\n    Step14: Move block with index 14\n    Step15: Move block with index 15\n\n}\n```\n"

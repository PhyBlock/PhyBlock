Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure can be broadly divided into two parts:\n    *   A smaller structure on the left, resembling a chair, consisting of 4 blocks and 4 layers.\n    *   A larger structure on the right consisting of 8 blocks with a maximum of 4 layers in the tallest section.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:** A red arch is on the bottom. A green rectangular block is stacked on top. A blue cube is placed on the green block. and an orange roof is put on top of the blue one.\n    *    **Right Structure**: Two orange cylinders support two yellow rectangular blocks, and on each yellow block, a roof has been installed. The central pillar constrcuted by two orange cylinders sits on top of two yellow blocks, and an orange roof is on top of those two.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   **Left structure:**\n    *   Red arch (Index 1)\n    *   Green rectangular block (horizontal orientation) (Index 7)\n    *   Blue cube (Index 3)\n    *    Orange roof (Index 13)\n*  **Right Structure:**\n    *   Orange cylinder (Index 10) x 4\n    *   Yellow rectangular block(Index 8) x2\n    *   Orange roof (Index 13) x3\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 7, 3, 13, 10, 10, 10, 10, 8, 8, 13, 13, 13.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n    Step11: Move block with index 10\n    Step12: Move block with index 10\n    Step13: Move block with index 13\n\n}\n```\n"

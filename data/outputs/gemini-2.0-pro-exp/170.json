Let's focus on the house-like structure on the right, as it's simpler to describe and assemble based on available blocks. It comprises:\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure has approximately three layers.\n    *   A base layer, middle layer and roof.\n    *   There are at least 7 visible blocks, but likely 8 total.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** Two green rectangular blocks laid horizontally, likely adjacent to make a wider platform. And one red arch.\n    *   **Middle Layer**: One blue cube rests centered on the middle layer.\n    *   **Roof**: Two orange triangular prisms face each other, forming the peaked roof, placed on the cube and potentially another green brick.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   5 (Green rectangular block) - Two or three of these.\n    *   1 (Red arch)\n    *   4 (Blue cube)\n    *    14 (Orange triangular prism) - Two of these.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n         {\n            Step1: Move block with index 5\n            Step2: Move block with index 5\n            Step3: Move block with index 1\n            Step4: Move block with index 5\n            Step5: Move block with index 4\n            Step6: Move block with index 14\n            Step7: Move block with index 14\n         }\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks. It has two layers:\n    *   Bottom Layer: Three identical red arched blocks.\n    *   Top Layer: Four cube blocks of different colors (green, red, blue, and yellow).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of three arched blocks placed side-by-side, creating a continuous arched base.\n    *   The top layer has four cube blocks placed directly on top of the arched base.\n    *   From left to right top view: the green is on the left arch, The red block spans across the left and center arch.The blue block is on center arch. the yellow blocks are stacked at the right arch.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Three red arched blocks.\n    *   One green cube.\n    *   One red cube.\n    *   One blue cube.\n    *   Two yellow cubes.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:**\n    *   Red arched blocks: 1, 1, 1\n    *   Green cube: 10\n    *   Red cube: 12\n    *   Blue cube: 9\n    *   Yellow cube: 13, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

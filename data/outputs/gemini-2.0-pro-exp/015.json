Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks, arranged in 3 layers.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two blue rectangular blocks, standing upright, side-by-side but not touching, creating a gap between them.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** A single, long yellow rectangular block placed horizontally, bridging the gap between the two blue blocks below.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** One red arch block. On top and each side of it is an orange triangle block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The blue blocks are parallel to each other.\n    *   The yellow block rests on top of the two blue blocks, perpendicular to them.\n    *   The red arch rests on top of the yellow block.\n    *    The orange triangle blocks rests on the yellow block and lean on the side of the arch block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two blue rectangular blocks (upright): Block index **7** (used twice)\n*   One yellow rectangular block (horizontal): Block index **10**\n*   One red arch: Block index **1**\n*   Two orange triangle: Block index **13** (used twice)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 10, 1, 13, 13\n\n**3. Determination of the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

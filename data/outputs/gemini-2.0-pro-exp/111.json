Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of three blocks. It has two layers: a base layer with two blocks and a top layer with one block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer consists of two identical red \"C\"-shaped blocks, placed side-by-side, but with a mirroring, so that they face each other with the flat sides to the edges of the structure.\n    *   The top layer has a single blue cube resting on top of the two red blocks, centered between them.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Two red \"C\"-shaped blocks that face each other.\n    *   One blue cube.\n*   **List Block Indices:**\n    *   Block 1 (red \"C\" shape)\n    *   Block 4 (red \"C\" shape mirrored to Block 1)\n    *   Block 9 (blue cube)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the selected blocks and the target image, here's the inferred assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\nExplanation of assembly:\n1. Place block 1, the first red C block.\n2. Place block 4, the second, mirrored red C block. Place it such that it is next to and faces block 1.\n3. Place the blue cube (Block 9) on the support structure created from the two previous blocks.\n"

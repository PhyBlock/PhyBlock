Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target structure in the main image appears to be a stylized animal (perhaps a giraffe or a similar quadruped). Let's break it down:\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   There are a total of 9 blocks visibly making up the main structure. There is a separate structure to the left made of 2 blocks, but I am not sure if I am supposed to reproduce it, so I am only analyzing the main structure.\n    *   The structure has multiple layers. The base layer consists of four cylindrical legs. The layer above contains two rectangular blocks supporting the body. Above this is a \"neck\" of three vertically stacked blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base:** Four orange, cylindrical blocks form the legs, spaced apart in a rectangular arrangement.\n    *   **Body:** Two long, yellow, rectangular blocks sit horizontally on top of the legs, spanning the space between them.\n    *   **Neck:** A green cube, a blue cube, and yellow half-cylinder are stacked vertically on top of the front yellow rectangular block, forming the neck and head.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary image:\n\n*   Four orange cylinders (for the legs): Block index **5** (used four times)\n*   Two long yellow rectangular block (for the body): Block index **4** (used two times)\n*    One green cube (for the neck base): Block index **2**\n*   One blue cube (for the neck): Block index **1**\n*   One Yellow half cylinder (for the head). Block index **7**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 1, 7\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 5\nStep2: Move block with index 5\nStep3: Move block with index 5\nStep4: Move block with index 5\nStep5: Move block with index 4\nStep6: Move block with index 4\nStep7: Move block with index 2\nStep8: Move block with index 1\nStep9: Move block with index 7\n}\n"

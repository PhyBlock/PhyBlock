Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target structure appears to be composed of two separate assemblies:\n\n*   **Assembly 1 (Left):** A taller structure resembling a chair or a stylized animal.\n    *   *Layers:* It has three layers.\n    *   *Blocks:*\n        *   Bottom Layer: Two vertical green rectangular blocks.\n        *   Middle Layer: One horizontal yellow rectangular block placed on top of the two green blocks.\n        *   Top Layer: One orange cylindrical block and a yellow semi-cylindrical block, placed on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n\n*   **Assembly 2 (Right):** A shorter structure resembling a low table or bench.\n    *   *Layers:* It has two layers.\n    *   *Blocks:*\n        *   Bottom Layer: Two red \"arch\" shaped blocks.\n        *   Top Layer: One horizontal yellow rectangular block, and a yellow semi-cylindrical block, placed on top of the arch.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships**:\n    * Assembly 1: The green blocks are parallel and support the yellow rectangular block perpendicularly. The orange cylinder sits vertically on one end, and the yellow semi-cylinder sits on the other end.\n    * Assembly 2: The two red arch blocks are parallel and support the yellow rectangular block. The yellow semi-cylinder is placed on top of the rectangular one.\n    * Assembly distance. The two assmeblies are spaced some distance apart.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Assembly 1:**\n    *   Two green vertical rectangular blocks: Index 5 (used twice)\n    *   One yellow horizontal rectangular block: Index 10\n    *   One orange cylindrical block: Index 11\n    *  One yellow semi-cylindrical block: Index 13\n\n*   **Assembly 2:**\n    *   Two red \"arch\" shaped blocks: Index 1 (used twice)\n    *   One yellow horizontal rectangular block: Index 9\n    *   One yellow semi-cylindrical block: Index 12\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere is inferred step-by-step assembly sequence. I will assemble the two parts independently.\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

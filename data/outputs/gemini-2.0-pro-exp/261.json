Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 11 blocks. It can be conceptually divided into two main sections:\n    *   A base structure formed by interconnected arches and blocks. This base has two layers if we count arches as one, three layers if we divide them into top and bottom.\n    *  A tall thin tower.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base:**\n        *   There are three red arch blocks forming the lowest layer of base.\n        *   On top of the arches are: two yellow half-cylinder, one blue cube, one yellow cube, one orange cube, and one green rectangle.\n    * **Tower**\n        * Green tall rectangular structure has a base orange cylinder and a red pyramid inside.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   1 (Red Arch - used three times)\n    *   4 (Blue Cube)\n    *    5 (Orange Cube)\n    *   6 (Yellow Cube)\n    *   9 (Green rectangle standing vertically)\n    *   14 (Yellow Half Cylinder, used two times)\n     *   13 (Orange Cylinder)\n    *   16(Red pyramid)\n    *   8 (green pillar)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 1\nStep3: Move block with index 1\nStep4: Move block with index 14\nStep5: Move block with index 4\nStep6: Move block with index 14\nStep7: Move block with index 6\nStep8: Move block with index 5\nStep9: Move block with index 9\nStep 10: Move block with index 13.\nStep11: Move block with index 16.\nStep 12: Move block with index 8.\n}\n```\n"

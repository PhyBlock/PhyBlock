Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The target structure consists of 7 blocks. It appears to have 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two yellow half-cylinder blocks, side by side.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):**A Blue block and Green Block are placed on the two yellow blocks. a Yellow rectangle connects two blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** A red U-shape block is at the center.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   14 (Yellow half-cylinder, need two)\n    *   6 (Blue block)\n    *    7 (Green Block)\n    *   11(Yellow rectangle block)\n    *   2 (Red U-shape)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows two distinct structures:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):** A vehicle-like structure.\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   Layer 1: Two orange cylinders.\n    *   Layer 2: One yellow rectangular block.\n    *   Layer 3: One blue cube.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two orange cylinders are placed parallel to each other, forming the base.\n    *   The yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the cylinders, spanning across them.\n    *   The blue cube is on top of the yellow block, set more towards what we will call the \"front\" of the vechicle.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):** A tower-like structure with a bridge element.\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   Layer 1: Two orange cylinders.\n    *    Layer 1.5: One orange cylinder.\n    *   Layer 2: One yellow rectangular block.\n    *   Layer 2.5 Two yellow rectangular blocks.\n    *   Layer 3: Two orange triangular prism.\n    *   Layer 4: One orange cylinder, stacked on top of eachother.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *    Two orange cylinder are placed vertically, defining the support of the bridge.\n    *   One yellow rectangular block is on top of the two cylinders.\n    *    The other two yellow rectangular blocks are perpendicular and adjecent to the prior yellow block.\n    *   Two orange triangular prisms are placed on top of the yellow blocks.\n    *   The orange cylinder are place ontop of eachother, next to the bridge.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 9: Orange cylinder (x2)\n    *   Block 6: Yellow rectangular block (x1)\n    *   Block 1: Blue cube (x1)\n*  **Structure 2:**\n    * Block 8: Orange cylinder (x3)\n    *   Block 6: Yellow rectangular block (x3)\n    *   Block 13: Orange triangular prism (x2)\n\n**Total Block Indices:** 1, 6, 8, 9, 13.\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n\n**Structure 2:**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n\n}\n"

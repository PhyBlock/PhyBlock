Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks. It has two layers. The bottom layer has one horizontal block. The second layer have two vertical cylinders and a horizontal block, The Top layer contains a Triangle.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer is a single, horizontally-placed rectangular block (yellow).\n    *   Above the base, there are two vertically oriented cylindrical blocks (orange), standing upright and parallel to each other. These are placed towards, but not at, the ends of the base block.\n    *   On top of the cylinders, a second horizontal yellow rectangular block spans across the top, connecting the two cylinders.\n    *   Finaly, there are a triangle block stand on top.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   One yellow horizontal rectangular block for the base. (Index 1)\n*   Two orange vertical cylinders. (Index 7)\n*    One yellow horizontal rectangular block. (Index 1)\n*   One Orange triangle. (Index 13)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 7, 7, 1, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is inferred based on the structure's layers and stability:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

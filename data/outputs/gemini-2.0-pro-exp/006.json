Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks. It has two main layers: a base layer and a top layer. There is also one block that span those two layers, in the middle.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** Two orange triangular prisms (blocks) are placed horizontally at the front, as the left and right, respectively. one green rectangular block in between the two triangular prisms, vertically.\n    *    One orange rectangular block, vertically, in the middle of the base, in between two green rectangular blocks.\n    *   **Top Layer:** One orange triangular prism is placed horizontally on top of the two vertically green rectangular blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required:\n\n*   Three orange triangular prisms: Two in a specific orientation, the opening facing left, as the side, and one facing down, as the roof.\n*   Two green rectangular blocks: vertical orientation.\n*  One orange rectangular block: Vertical orientation.\n\nTherefore, the required block indices are:\n\n*   16 (orange triangular prism - as the right side)\n*   12 (orange triangular prism - as the left side)\n*   13 (orange triangular prism - as the roof)\n*    4 (green rectangular block, vertical)\n*    4 (green rectangular block, vertical)\n*  9 (orange rectangular block, vertical)\n\n**3. Determination of the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the structure and selected blocks, the following assembly order is inferred:\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 9\nStep2: Move block with index 4\nStep3: Move block with index 4\nStep4: Move block with index 12\nStep5: Move block with index 16\nStep6: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

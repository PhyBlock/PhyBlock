It can be conceptually divided into three layers: a bottom layer, a middle layer (composed of two blocks), and a top layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There is a red \"C\" shaped block which is on the bottom.\n    *   A blue cube block that is on the top of the left side of the bottom \"C\" shaped block.\n    *   A green cube that is on the top of the right side of the bottom \"C\" shaped block, and the blue block and the green block are next to each other.\n    *   There is a red \"C\" shape block on the top of the blue and green blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   A red \"C\" shaped block (bottom layer)\n*   A blue block.\n*    A green block.\n*   A red \"C\" shaped block (top layer)\n\nThe corresponding block indices are:\n\n*   2\n*   9\n*   10\n*   6\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n"

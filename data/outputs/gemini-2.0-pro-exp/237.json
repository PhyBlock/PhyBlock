            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the task and the solution based on the provided images.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures. Let's analyze them separately:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 6 blocks. It appears to be mostly one layer, except where blocks are directly on top of others.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There's a horizontal green rectangular block at the base.\n    *   A vertical green rectangular prism is to the right.\n    *   An orange cylinder is between the horizontal and vertical green blocks.\n    *   An orange triangular prism is on the horizontal green and cylinder.\n    *   A vertical green rectanglar is in the behind of the orange cylinder.\n    *   An orange triangular prism is on the floor, at the right of all.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 6 blocks and has 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer has a yellow cube and a blue cube, side-by-side.\n    *   Above the yellow cube, there's an orange cube.\n    *    Above the blue cube, there's a green cube.\n    *    Above the green cube is a blue cube.\n    *   On top of the all, there is a red cube.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Horizontal green rectangular block: Index 6\n*   Orange cylinder: Index 10\n*   Vertical green rectangular block: Index 8, 7\n*    Orange Triangular prism: Index 13, 15\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Yellow cube: Index 5\n*   Blue cube: Index 1\n*   Orange cube: Index 3\n*   Green cube: Index 2\n*   Blue cube: Index 1\n*    Red cube: Index 4\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n**Structure 2**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n\n**Summary**\nTwo structures were identified, described, the constiuent blocks identified by index, and a step-by-step build order provided.\n"

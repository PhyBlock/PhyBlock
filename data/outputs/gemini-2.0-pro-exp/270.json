            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows two distinct structures. Let's analyze them separately:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 5 blocks. It has three layers.\n    *   Layer 1: Two angled orange blocks(wedges, ramps).\n    *   Layer 2: Two blue rectangular blocks.\n    *   Layer 3: One orange cylinder.\n    *   Layer 4: One orange triangular prism (roof).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two angled orange blocks form the base.\n    *    The two blue rectangular blocks are placed next to angled orange blocks on base.\n    *   The orange cylinder is on top of rectangular blue blocks.\n    *    The orange triangular prism is on the top of cylinder.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure has 6 blocks. Appears to have three layers.\n    *   Layer 1: One red arch, one blue cube, and one green cube.\n    *   Layer 2: Two yellow rectangular blocks.\n    *   Layer 3: one orange triangular prism.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The blue and green cubes are on one side of the arch, supporting the two yellow blocks.\n    *   The two yellow blocks form a bridge resting above the blue cube, green cube, and red arch.\n    *    One orange triangular prism is on the top of yellow rectangular block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1**\n*   Orange angled blocks (wedges): 15, 15\n*   Blue rectangular blocks: 7, 7\n*   Orange cylinder: 12\n*   Orange triangular prism: 16\n\n**Structure 2**\n\n*   Red Arch: 1\n*   Blue Cube: 4\n*   Green Cube: 5\n*   Yellow Rectangular Blocks: 8, 8\n*   Orange triangular prism: 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 15\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 5\n    Step10: Move block with index 8\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

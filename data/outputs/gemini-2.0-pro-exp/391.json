Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows a toy train consisting of two connected sections: an engine and a cargo car.\n\n*   **Engine (Left Side):**\n    *   **Base Layer:** Two orange cylindrical blocks lying horizontally, side-by-side, forming the wheels. One green rectangular block and One yellow rectangular block, placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinder.\n    *   **Second Layer:** One blue rectangular block on top of the green block. One red rectangular block on top of the yellow block.\n    *   **Top Layer:** An arched yellow block placed sideways, spanning the blue and red blocks.\n*    **Cargo Car (Right Side):**\n    *    **Base Layer**: Two red arch block\n    *    **Second Layer**: One big red block with a hole.\n    *    **Top Layer**: One yellow rectangular block.\n\n*   **Total Blocks:** 12\n*   **Layers:** The structure has varying layers, with a maximum of three layers in some parts.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The orange cylinders are parallel and serve as the base of engine part.\n    *   The engine and cargo car is connect.\n    *    Red arch block is on the base of cargo car.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed from the provided dictionary image:\n\n*   **2 x Block 14:** Orange cylinder (for the engine's wheels).\n*   **1 x Block 8:** Green Horizontal Rectangular Block.\n*   **1 x Block 10:** Yellow Horizontal Rectangular Block.\n*   **1 x Block 5:** Blue Rectangular Block.\n*    **1 x Block 7:** Red Rectangular Block.\n*   **1 x Block 15:** Yellow Arched Block.\n*   **2 x Block 2:** Red arch block\n*   **1 x Block 1:** Big Red Block.\n*    **1 x Block 12:** Yellow rectanglar block\n\n**Block Indices List:** 14, 14, 8, 10, 5, 7, 15, 2, 2, 1, 12\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence, assuming the blocks are placed in order from bottom layer to the upper layer:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n"

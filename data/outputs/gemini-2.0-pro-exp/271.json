Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows *two* separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Structure):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 9 blocks. It has two layers: a base layer and a top layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer is composed of four orange ramp-like blocks (#12, #13, #15, #16) and 4 blue square like bolock (#7, #8, #9) arranged in an alternating square.\n    *   The ramps are positioned with their sloped sides facing outward, creating a square footprint.\n    *   The Top layer is a green square block (#4) in the middle.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Structure):**\n\n*    **Count and Layers:** This structure has 2 blocks and 2 layers.\n*    **Spatial Relationship:**\n     *    The bottom layer is consists of a U-shape block (#2)\n     *    The top layer is just an orange rectangular block (#11)\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   4 x Orange ramp blocks: #12, #13, #15, #16\n    *   4 x Blue square block: #7, #8, #9\n    *\t1 x Green square block : #4\n*    **Structure 2:**\n    *   1 x Red U-shape block : #2\n    *    1 x Orange rectangular block: #11\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 16\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n**Structure 2:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n"

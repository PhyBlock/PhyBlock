Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of two distinct parts.\n    *   The first part (left side) has 4 blocks across 2 layers.\n    *   The second part (Right side) has 7 blocks across 2 layers\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **First Part(Left):**\n        *   Layer 1: Two vertical arch-supporting blocks (likely green, hard to tell for sure from this angle).\n        *   Layer 2: One horizontal rectangular block on top of the two supports, and arch block on top the rectangular one.\n        *   Layer 3: One triangle block.\n    *   **Second Part(Right):**\n        *   Layer 1: Three red arch-supporting blocks.\n        *   Layer 2: Two horizontal half-cylinder blocks placed on top of the red supports. Two yellow rectangular vertical blocks and One green vertical block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **First Part:**\n    *   2 x Block 4 (Green vertical rectangular block)\n    *   1 x Block 6 (Yellow horizontal rectangular block)\n    *   1 x Block 15 (Red triangle block)\n    *   1 x Block 16 (Red arch)\n*   **Second Part:**\n    *   3 x Block 1 (Red arch-supporting block)\n    *   2 x Block 11 (Yellow half-cylinder block)\n    *   2 x Block 8 (yellow Vertical rectangular block)\n    *   1 x Block 3 (Green vertical rectangular block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 4\n        Step2: Move block with index 4\n        Step3: Move block with index 6\n        Step4: Move block with index 16\n        Step5: Move block with index 15\n        Step6: Move block with index 1\n        Step7: Move block with index 1\n        Step8: Move block with index 1\n        Step9: Move block with index 11\n        Step10: Move block with index 11\n        Step11: Move block with index 8\n        Step12: Move block with index 8\n        Step13: Move block with index 3\n    }\n"

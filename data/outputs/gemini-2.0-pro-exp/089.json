Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks. It has multiple layers:\n    *   A base layer of four cylindrical blocks.\n    *   A middle layer of two rectangular blocks.\n    *   Top layer has 1 half cylinder.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer has four vertical, cylindrical blocks, acting as legs. These are positioned at the four corners of an imaginary rectangle.\n    *   The second level is build of two long, horizontal rectangular blocks.\n    *   The top layer only has a half cylinder on one side, looks like a head of a giraffe.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Four vertical cylinders (for the legs): Block index 7 (four times)\n*   Two horizontal, long, thin rectangular block: Block index 1 (two times)\n*    One half cylinder: Block index 10.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 1, 10.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n\n}\n```\n"

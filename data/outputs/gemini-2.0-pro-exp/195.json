            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows two distinct structures: a chair-like structure and a house-like structure. Let's break them down:\n\n**Chair Structure:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 6 blocks. It has roughly 4 layers (from bottom to top):\n    1.  Two vertical rectangular supports (legs).\n    2.  One horizontal rectangular block connecting the legs.\n    3.  One horizontal Rectangular block.\n    4. one Vertical rectangluar block.\n    5. One semi-circular block on top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two green, long, rectangular blocks are the base, standing vertically and parallel to each other.\n    *   A yellow, long, rectangular block connects the two green blocks horizontally, sitting on top of them.\n    *   A red rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the yellow rectangular block, it will be in between green ones.\n    *   A blue rectangular block stands vertically on the red.\n    *   A yellow semi-circular block sits on top of the blue block, completing the chair's \"back\".\n\n**House Structure:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure also uses 6 blocks, and has about 4 layers.\n    1.  Two horizontal, short, rectangular supports.\n    2. One large Rectangular.\n    3. one large square.\n    4. one large triangle.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two blue, short rectangular blocks act as the base, lying horizontally and separated.\n    *   One yellow, long rectangular, block connect them and placed on top of them.\n    *   One red, square block, placed on top of the yellow one.\n    *   One green, rectangular, block sits on top of the red square.\n    *   An orange triangular prism forms the roof, sitting on top of the green block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Chair Structure:**\n\n*   Two green vertical rectangular blocks: **6, 6**\n*   One horizontal yellow rectangular: **8**\n*  One horizontal red rectangular: **3**\n* One Blue Rectangular: **1**\n*   One yellow semi-circular block: **9**\n\n**House Structure:**\n\n*   Two blue horizontal rectangular blocks: **4, 4**\n*    One horizontal yellow rectangular: **7**\n*   One red square block: **3**\n*   One green rectangular block: **5**\n*   One orange triangular prism: **14**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly, separated for the chair and the house:\n\n**Chair structure:**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n}\n\n**House Structure:**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n}\n"

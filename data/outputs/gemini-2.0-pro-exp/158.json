Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 5 blocks. It has three layers.\n    *   Bottom Layer: One long yellow rectangular block.\n    *   Middle Layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks placed vertically side-by-side on top of the yellow block.\n    *   Top Layer: One red arch block and an orange roof like block on top of cylinders.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The yellow block serves as the base.\n    *   The two orange cylinders are parallel and adjacent to each other, positioned on the yellow base.\n    *   The red arch block and the roof like orange block are kept on the cylinders.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure has 4 block in single layer.\n    * Bottom layer: Two yellow large blocks and between those block there are two small green side blocks.\n* **Spatial Relationship**\n    * The structure consist four blocks, a yellow rectangular block, kept adjacent a green block, another yellow rectangular block and another green block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Bottom Layer: Block 8 (Yellow rectangular block)\n*   Middle Layer: Block 11 (Orange cylinder) x 2\n*   Top Layer: Block 1 (Red arch), Block 13(orange roof).\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Bottom Layer: Block 10 (yellow large block) x2, Block 5 (Green block) x 2.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n**Structure 2**\n```\n{\n\tStep1: Move block with index 10\n\tStep2: Move block with index 5\n\tStep3: Move block with index 10\n\tStep4: Move block with index 5\n}\n```\n"

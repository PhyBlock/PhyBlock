Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows two separate structures. Let's focus on building only the structure that consists of multiple pieces on the right, it consist of following elements:\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** There are 4 blocks. It's essentially a two-layered structure. The bottom layer has two orange cylinder, the second one consist of a large yellow cuboid and yellow cylinder section and the top most layer consist of blue cuboid.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two orange cylinder are on the bottom, parallel and next to each other.\n    *   A yellow cuboid is placed on top of bottom layer.\n    *   A small yellow cylinderical section placed on the top of yellow cuboid towards it's edge.\n    *    A blue cuboid is placed on top of yellow cuboid.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n*   Two orange cylinder: Block index 13 (used twice).\n*   Yellow cuboid: Block index 11.\n*  Small yellow section of cylinder: Block index 14.\n*  Blue cuboid: Block index 6.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n"

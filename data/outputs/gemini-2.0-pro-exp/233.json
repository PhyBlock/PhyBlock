            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures: a chair-like structure and a vehicle-like structure. Let's break down each one:\n\n**Chair-like Structure:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**  The chair has 6 blocks. It can be considered to have multiple layers: a base layer (two green rectangular prisms), a connecting layer (yellow horizontal rectangular prism), and a backrest layers(yellow, blue, and red rectangular prisms, on top of each other)\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two vertical green blocks form the base legs.\n    *   A horizontal yellow block connects the two green blocks.\n    *  A vertical yellow block stands on the connection block.\n    *   A blue block and a red block are stacked up to form the back.\n\n**Vehicle-like Structure:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The vehicle has 5 blocks. The layers are: a base of two orange cylinders, a yellow rectangular prism, a blue cube and yellow half cylinder..\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two orange cylinders form the wheels.\n    *   A yellow rectangular prism connects the two cylinders.\n    *   A blue cube sits on top of the yellow prism.\n    *  A yellow half cylinder sits on top of the yellow prism.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices from the dictionary image:\n\n**Chair:**\n\n*   Green Vertical Blocks (Legs): 4, 4\n*   Yellow Horizontal Block (Connector): 6\n*  Yellow Vertical Block: 8\n* Blue and red Blocks: 3, 12\n\n**Vehicle:**\n\n*   Orange Cylinders (Wheels): 10, 10\n*   Yellow Horizontal Block (Base): 6\n*   Blue Cube: 1\n*  Yellow Half Cylinder: 11\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 4, 4, 6, 8, 3, 12, 10, 10, 6, 1, 11\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere is step by step instruction.\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n"

Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** There are 10 blocks in total.\n*   **Layers:** The structure has multiple layers. We can consider them as:\n    *   Base Layer: Consists of blocks directly on the \"ground\".\n    *   Second Layer: Blocks placed on top of the base layer.\n    *   Third Layer: In one structure one block is highest.\n*  There are two distinct structures.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:**\n        *   A blue block forms the base.\n        *   A yellow block is placed on top of the blue block.\n        *    A green block is placed on top of the yellow block.\n        *   A red arch block is standing upright near to the blue block.\n        *    An orange wedge block is on top of the yellow and the arch block.\n    *    **Structure 2:**\n        *   Two orange wedge blocks with their sloped sides facing the ground.\n        *   A blue block forms the bottom of the structure.\n        *   An orange cyclinder is beside them.\n        *    An orange arch block is on top of the blue and orange cyclinder.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   **Structure 1**\n    *   1 x Blue Cube (Index 4)\n    *   1 x Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal) (Index 8)\n    *  1 x Green Rectangular Block (vertical) (Index 5)\n    *   1 x Red Arch (Index 1)\n    *   1 x Orange Wedge (Index 15)\n*    **Structure 2**\n    *  2 x Orange Wedge (Index 16)\n    *   1 x Blue Rectangular Block (horizontal) (Index 6)\n    *   1 x Orange Cylinder (vertical) (Index 10)\n    *   1 x Orange Arch (Index 3)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 4, 8, 5, 1, 15, 16, 16, 6, 10, 3\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 6\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 3\n\n}\n```\n"

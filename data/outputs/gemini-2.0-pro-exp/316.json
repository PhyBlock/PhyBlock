Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 7 blocks and has 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer has four orange triangular prism blocks (specifically those angled inward, forming a square hole in the center) and the corners are pointed outwards.\n    *    On the corners sits one blue rectangular block.\n    *   The second layer has a green square block on top of the blue rectangular block.\n    * On the green block, there is one more blue rectangualr block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 6 blocks and has 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer has a central red \"arch\" block, flanked by two orange rectangular blocks, and two yellow square block at the front and at the back.\n    *   The second layer has a green square block on top of the red block, one blue rectangualr block sits next to the green block. On top of the blue block, there is an orange triangular prism block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Orange triangular prism (inward angled): **13, 14, 15, 16** (Four times)\n*   Blue rectangualr block: **7,9** (Two times)\n*    Green square block: **5**\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Red arch block: **1**\n*   Orange rectangular blocks: **11** (Two times)\n*   Yellow square blocks: **6** (Two times)\n*   Green square blocks: **5**\n*   Blue Rectangular block: **8**\n*   Orange triangular prism: **12**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 15\n    Step4: Move block with index 16\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n**Structure 2:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n"

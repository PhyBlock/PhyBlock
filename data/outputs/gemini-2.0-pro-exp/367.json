Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 4 blocks and has 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The first layer consists of two orange cylinders standing upright, side-by-side but not touching.\n    *   The second layer has a yellow, horizontally-oriented rectangular block bridging the two cylinders.\n    *   An orange triangular prism is resting on the rectangular block.\n    \n**Structure 2 (Right Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 5 blocks, and appears to be a single, interconnected structure.\n*   **Spatial Relationship**\n    *   Has two long, vertical yellow blocks that are parallel.\n    *   Has two short horizontal, green blocks on the top and bottom connecting the vertical yellow blocks.\n    *   A red triangular prism is laying inside the structure.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices from the block dictionary image:\n\n**Structure 1**\n*   Orange Cylinders (x2): Block index **9** (We need two of these)\n*   Yellow Horizontal Rectangular Block: Block index **6**\n*  Orange triangular prism: Block index **14**\n\n**Structure 2**\n* Yellow Vertical Rectangular: Block Index **8** (we need two of these)\n* Green Horizontal Rectangular: Block Index **4** (We need two of these)\n* Red triangular prism: Block Index **12**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nBased on selected block, I decided assembly sequence.\n\n**Structure 1**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n**Structure 2**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks. There are conceptually three layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** A single yellow rectangular block lying flat.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Two orange cylindrical blocks standing upright, and one yellow rectangular block lying flat on top of the cylinders.\n    *  **Top Layer:** One arch, two triangular prism.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer has the long yellow block.\n    *   The two orange cylinders are placed vertically on top of the base layer block, positioned towards each end, leaving space between them.\n    *   Another yellow rectangle sits on top of orange cylinder.\n    *   The arch is located at the center of the flat yellow block.\n    *   The two triangular is placed on the arch.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed from the provided dictionary image:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   8 (Yellow, horizontal rectangular block - base)\n    *   10 (Orange, cylinder) x 2\n    *   6 (Yellow, horizontal rectangular block - Top)\n    *   1 (Red arch)\n    *   13 (Orange, triangular prism)\n    *   15 (Orange, triangular prism)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

Bottom layer made by two cylinder. second layer contain two rectangle, third layer, made by one cylinder.\n    *   **Assembly 2 (Right):**\n        *    5 blocks\n        *    3 layers. Bottom layer made by two arch, second layer contain one rectangle, and third layer made by two roof.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Assembly 1 (Left):**\n        *    Two cylinder are standing vertically on the ground, Side by Side.\n        *    Two horizontal rectangle places on top of cylinder, Side by Side.\n        *    One cylinder places vertically on top of rectangle.\n    *   **Assembly 2 (Right):**\n        *   Two arch blocks form the base, side-by-side.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block spans across the top of the two arch blocks.\n        *   Two roof block places on top of rectangle.\n\n**Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   **Assembly 1:**\n    *   Block 7 (Orange Cylinder): 3\n    *   Block 4(yellow rectangle): 2\n\n*   **Assembly 2:**\n    *   Block 1 (Red Arch): 2\n    *   Block 4 (Yellow Rectangle): 1\n    *  Block 16(Roof): 2\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\n\n1, 4, 7, 16\n\n**Assembly Order:**\nAssembly 1:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n}\nAssembly 2:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 16\n    Step5: Move block with index 16\n}\n"

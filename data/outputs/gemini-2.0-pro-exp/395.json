Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure consists of two separate assemblies:\n    *   **Assembly 1 (Tall Structure):** 5 blocks, 4 layers.\n    *   **Assembly 2 (Bridge-like Structure):** 3 blocks, 2 layers.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   **Assembly 1:**\n        *   **Layer 1:** A red block with a cylindrical cutout.\n        *   **Layer 2:** A Yellow block on top, and a yellow rectangular block on top.\n        *   **Layer 3:** A green rectangular block, oriented vertically.\n        *   **Layer 4:** A Yellow rectangular block on top, and an orange triangle on top.\n\n    *   **Assembly 2:**\n        *   **Layer 1:** Two red, arch-shaped blocks, spaced apart.\n        *   **Layer 2:** A yellow block, with a cylindrical cutout on its side, spanning the two red arches.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **Assembly 1:**\n    *   Index 3 (Red cylinder cutout)\n    *   Index 8 (Yellow rectangle)\n    *   Index 5 (Green rectangle, vertical)\n    *    Index 8 (Yellow rectangle)\n    *   Index 15 (Orange triangle)\n\n*   **Assembly 2:**\n    *   Index 1 (Red arch - used twice)\n    *   Index 10 (Yellow cylinder cutout laying on long side)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 3, 8, 5, 8, 15, 1, 1, 10\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence, separated for each assembly:\n\n**Assembly 1**\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly 2**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n**Important considerations made:**\n* No rotation: The solution strictly adheres to using presented orientation.\n* Block indices used: The block indices are correctly referenced.\n* Order of steps: The inferred order will allow to build the model.\n* Separated assembly: Since in the presented picture, the two assembly are not joined, the steps are kept separated.\n\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 4 blocks arranged in 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer is a red arch-shaped block (like an inverted \"U\").\n    *   The top layer has three cube-shaped blocks sitting on top of the arch:\n        * A blue cube on the left side.\n        * A red cube in the middle.\n        *   A yellow cube on the right.\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure appears to be a vehicle (possibly a car or truck) and consists of 5 blocks with what appears to be, at most, three layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer comprises two orange cylinders lying horizontally and parallel to each other, acting as wheels.\n    *   On top of the \"wheels\", is a lime green rectangular block, oriented horizontally, that bridges them.\n    *    On top of that rectangular block sits an orange triangular prism.\n    * On top of the rectangular block, in front of the orange triangular prism is an orange, vertical, rectangular prism.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, these are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 1 (Red Arch)\n    *   Block 4 (Blue Cube)\n    *   Block 6 (Red Cube)\n    *   Block 7 (Yellow Cube)\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 11 (Orange Cylinder)\n    *   Block 12 (Orange Cylinder)\n    *   Block 8 (Lime green rectangle)\n    *   Block 14 (Orange triangular Prism)\n    * Block 13. (orange rectangular prism)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

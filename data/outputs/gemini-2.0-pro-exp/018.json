Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks, arranged in 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Two red arch-shaped blocks form the foundation, placed parallel to each other with a gap in between.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** A single yellow rectangular block spans across the top of the two base arches, bridging the gap.\n    *    **Layer 3 (Top):** another two red arch-shaped blocks, on the yellow rectangular, and two orange triangle blocks are placed on top of the two arch blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required from the block dictionary image:\n\n*   Four of Block Index **1** (Red arch, oriented correctly)\n*   One of Block Index **8** (Yellow rectangular block, horizontal)\n*    Two of Block Index **13**(Orange triangle)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the building instructions.\n\n**Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\nWe see two separate structures in the main image. I will focus on building the structure on the **right side**, that is the one built with **red** and **orange** blocks.\n\n*   **Block Count:** The red/orange structure appears to be made of 5 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure has two layers.\n    *   The bottom layer has two \"arch\" shaped blocks.\n    *   The top layer sits on these arches and includes three triangular prism shaped block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two arch blocks on the bottom are parallel and are not directly touching.\n    *   The three triangular blocks on top form a continuous, connected shape. Two are placed side-by-side, and a central one bridges across.\n\n**Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary image:\n\n*   Two red arch blocks (oriented with the arch opening downwards). Looking at the dictionary, this corresponds to **block index 2**.\n*   Three orange triangular prism.\n    * Two blocks with orientation **block index 15**\n    * One block with orientation **block index 13**\n\n**Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 15\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n**Explanation**\n1.  Place two red arch blocks, these are block with index 2.\n2. Then we place on the left one of the blocks with index 15.\n3. Next to it, we add block 13.\n4. Finally, the other block 15.\n"

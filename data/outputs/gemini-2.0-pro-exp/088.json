It has conceptually two layers: a base layer formed by the red arch, and a second layer made up by the two blue cubes.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base is a red arch, standing vertically.\n    *   Two blue cubes are placed through the holes in the red arch, from opposite sides. They appear to be partially inside the arch.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   One red arch.\n    *   Two blue cubes.\n*   **List of Block Indices:**\n    *   6 (for the red arch)\n    *   9 (for the first blue cube)\n    *    9 (for the second blue cube)\n*  **Matching Criteria Justification**\n    * Block index 6: There are a few similar red arches. Number 6 is the red arch and is vertical relative to how the blocks are laid out on their sides in the main image.\n    * Block index 9: There are different color cubes, and some blocks that are not cubes. Block index 9 is the blue cube.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is inferred as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n"

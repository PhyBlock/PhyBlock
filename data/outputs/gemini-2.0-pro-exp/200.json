Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows two separate structures. Let's describe them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure appears to be composed of 7 blocks, arranged in roughly 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red cylindrical block with a hole, a yellow rectangular block\n    *   **Layer 2:** An orange triangular prism block.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A green cube, stacked on the middle of layer2. A blue cube on the top of orrange triangular prism.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top):**An orange triangular prism block on the top of green and blue cube.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure has 4 blocks and 2 layers.\n*    **Spatial Relationships:**\n     *   **Layer 1:** Two yellow half-cylinders, with space in the middle.\n     *    **Layer 2:** One long yellow rectangular prism.On top of that, placed centrally, is a orange triangular prism.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 1 (Red Cylinder)\n    *   Block 9 (Yellow Rectangle)\n    *   Block 14 (Orange triangular prism)\n    *   Block 5 (Green Cube)\n    *   Block 4 (Blue Cube)\n    *   Block 13 (Orange triangular prism)\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 12 (Yellow Half Cylinder) - Used twice\n    *   Block 7 (Yellow rectangular prism)\n    *    Block 15 (Orange triangular prism)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

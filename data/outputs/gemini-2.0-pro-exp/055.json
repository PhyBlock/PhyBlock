Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks. There are conceptually 3 layers: a base layer, a middle layer, and a top layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** There are two, yellow, long blocks oriented horizontally and laying flat, parallel to each other.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Four blocks make a square pillar. From bottom to top: red cube, blue cube, green rectangular block (standing vertically). In front, a mirror set, so red cube, blue cube, and green block.\n    *    **Top Layer:** There are two, yellow, long blocks oriented horizontally and laying flat, parallel to each other and parallel to bottom layer.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Four yellow, long horizontal flat blocks: Index 11 (x4)\n*   Two red cubes: Index 3 (x2)\n*   Two blue cubes: Index 1 (x2)\n*  Two green, long, vertical blocks: Index 7 (x2)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 11, 11, 3, 1, 7, 3, 1, 7, 11, 11\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 3\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 11\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\nThe placement order is not relevant, as long as the shape, color and rotation orientation is followed.\n"

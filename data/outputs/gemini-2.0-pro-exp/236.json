Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of two distinct parts. The taller structure has approximately 4 layers, and smaller structure, to it's right, consists of 2 layers. The total block count is 10.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Taller Structure:**\n        *   **Base Layer:** Two green rectangular blocks, placed vertically, side-by-side, supporting a yellow, rectangular, horizontal block on top, spanning the two green blocks.\n        *   **Second Layer:** A Yellow horizontal rectangular block.\n        *    **Third Layer**: Two orange cylinder blocks, placed vertically, side-by-side, on the horizontal block.\n        *   **Top Layer:** A yellow rectangular block, placed horizontally.\n    *    **Small structure**:\n        *   Two orange cylinder blocks.\n        *  One yellow rectangluar horizontal block on top.\n    *   **Relative position.** The two structures are near each other, however not directly in contact.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two green rectangular blocks, vertical orientation: Block index **1** (used twice)\n*   Three Yellow rectangular block, horizontal oritentation: Block index **8** (used three times)\n*   Four orange cylinders, verticle: Block index **9** (used four times)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 9\n    Step9: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n"

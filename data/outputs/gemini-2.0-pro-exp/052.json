Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 6 blocks. It has three layers: a base layer, a middle layer, and a top layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer consists of one horizontally placed yellow rectangular block.\n    *   The middle layer consists of 3 blocks total. One is a vertically placed long green block, and a red and blue block sit next to the green block.\n    *   The top layer mirrored the bottom layer, with a horizontally placed yellow rectangular block, just rotated.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **Yellow Rectangular Blocks (Horizontal):** Two of these are needed. Looking at the dictionary, index 11 matches this description. So two 11's.\n* **Green Rectangular Blocks (Vertical):** One of these is needed. Looking at the dictionary, index 8 matches.\n*   **Blue Cube:** Looking at the dictionary, index 1.\n* **Red Cube:** Looking at the dictionary, index 3.\n\nTherefore the block indexes are: 11, 8, 1, 3, 11.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\nExplanation of Each Step\n* Step 1: Place the first yellow block (11) horizontally as base\n* Step 2: Place the green block (8) vertically, in contact with the first yellow block.\n* Steps 3 & 4: Next to the vertical green block, a red and blue cube are added.\n* Step 5: Finish with mirroring the base layer.\n"

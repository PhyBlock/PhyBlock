Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure consists of 5 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure has two layers.\n    *   The base layer has 4 blocks.\n    * The top has a single, centered block.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - Layer1:\n        - There are two slanted, orange blocks on opposing sides that serve as supports for the other layers.\n        - There is a red arch that is connected by the two slanted blocks.\n    - Layer2:\n        - There is a Green rectangle that sits directly on top of the red arch, positioned centrally.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   1 (Red arch)\n    *   6 (Green rectangle)\n    *   11 (Slanted orange)\n    *   16 (Slanted orange, mirrored)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 16\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n**Explanation**\n1.  Place the left slanted blocks.\n2.  Place the right slanted blocks.\n3. Connect the two slanted blocks with the arch.\n4.  Finally, place the Green rectangle on the top.\n"

            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the images and provide the block selection and assembly instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nI will focus on the structure on the *left* side of the main target image, as it's a simpler structure with more obvious block components, and makes for a more suitable task for which the Block Dictionary Image seems designed.\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks. It has three layers:\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** Two horizontal, long blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Two square blocks, and one vertical, long block.\n    *   **Top Layer:** One horizontal, long block\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two yellow, long, and flat, horizontally-oriented blocks, parallel, and with a space between them.\n    *   The middle layer has:\n        *   A red square block, directly on top of the gap of left-side of the first layer.\n        *   A blue square block, directly on top of the gap of the right-side of the first layer.\n        *   A green, long, and thick block, oriented vertically, central, and spans the gap between the lower yellow blocks.\n    *    The top layer has one yellow, long, flat block on the top. The block spans the entire structure, covering the blocks in the middle layer.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   9 (Yellow, long, flat, horizontal): Used twice (bottom layer).\n    *   1 (Blue, square)\n    *   4 (Red, square)\n    *   8 (Green, long, thick, vertical)\n    *   11 (Yellow, long, flat, horizontal): Used once (top layer).\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n\n}\n```\n**Explanation of the assembly steps**\n1. Put down the first yellow block(index 9).\n2. Put down the second yellow block(index 9) parallel to the first one, creating the bottom layer's gap.\n3. Put the vertical green block(index 8) in between the two yellow blocks.\n4.  Put the red block(index 4) onto the gap of the left side of the bottom layer.\n5.  Put the blue block(index 1) onto the gap of the right side of the bottom layer.\n6. Put the horizontal yellow block(index 11) to top of the structure.\n"

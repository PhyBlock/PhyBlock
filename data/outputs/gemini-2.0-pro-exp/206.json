            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the images and provide the construction steps.  I'll break it down as requested:\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures. I'll describe each one separately.\n\n**Structure 1 (Left - Tower-like):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 6 blocks and has 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Two red \"arch\" shaped blocks, oriented with the arches facing down, spaced apart.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A single yellow rectangular block placed horizontally, bridging the two arch blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3:** Two green rectangular block, put vertically on the yellow block.\n    *   **Layer 4:**A orange triangle block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right - Vehicle-like):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure appears to use 4 blocks arranged in what could be considered 3 layers or levels of construction.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Two orange cylindrical blocks laid horizontally, parallel to each other, and spaced apart.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A single yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of and bridging the two cylindrical blocks.\n    *    **Layer 3:** A single blue cubic block in the centre of the yellow block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n*   Red Arch Blocks (2): Index **1** (used twice)\n*   Yellow Rectangular Block (1): Index **9**\n*    Green Rectangular Block (2): Index **8** (used twice)\n*    Orange triangle Block (1): Index **13**\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Orange Cylindrical Blocks (2): Index **12** (used twice)\n*   Yellow Rectangular Block (1): Index **9**\n*   Blue Cubic Block (1): Index **6**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence, separated by structure:\n\n**Structure 1 (Tower):**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\n**Structure 2 (Vehicle):**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n"

It has, conceptually, 3 layers (or 2 if considering that two of the blocks make up what would normally be a single layer) stacked vertically.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There's a red, curved block forming the bottom layer.\n    *   There's a green rectangular block in the middle forming the second layer.\n    *   Another red, curved block lies on top, creating the top layer. The top and bottom blocks are red, and through their open tunnel a green block is visible that connect these two.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, we need:\n    *   Two red, curved blocks, oriented so the openings are facing each other.\n    *   One horizontal, green brick.\n*   **List of Block Indices:**\n    *   5\n    *   10\n    *   8\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of two separate assemblies.\n    *   The first assembly consists of 5 blocks arranged in a single vertical stack (5 layers).\n    *  The second assembly on consists of 2 blocks, a base and the top (2 layers)\n*    **Total Blocks**: 7\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   **First Assembly:** It has a red arch-shaped block at the bottom and top (layers 1 &5). Between these two, there's a green rectangular block(layer 2), a blue square block (layer 3), and a yellow square block(layer 4).\n    * **Second Assembly**: It has a red arch-shaped block at the bottom, and blue cubic block at the top.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are needed:\n\n*   **Red Arch-Shaped Blocks:** We need three of these, as presented in the dictionary in block index 1.\n* **Blue Cubic Block**: We need One of this, block index 8.\n*   **Green Rectangular Blocks:** We need one of these, positioned vertically - Block Index 13\n* **Blue Square Block**: We need One of this, block index 8.\n*   **Yellow Square Block:** We need one, block index 11.\n\n**Required Block Indices:** 1, 1, 13, 8, 11, 8\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 13\nStep3: Move block with index 8\nStep4: Move block with index 11\nStep5: Move block with index 1\nStep6: Move block with index 1\nStep7: Move block with index 8\n}\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks and is 4 layers high.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of a blue rectangular block and brown rectangular block, side by side, make up the foundation.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A red block with a semi-circular cutout sits on top of both the blue and brown blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A green rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the red cutout block.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange triangular prism sits on top of the green block, completing the \"roof\" of the structure.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Blue rectangular Block: Index **6**\n*   Brown rectangular Block: Index **7**\n*   Red Semi-circular Cutout Block: Index **2**\n*   Green rectangular Block: Index **9**\n*   Orange triangular block: Index **14**\n\n**List Block Indices:** 6, 7, 2, 9, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe inferred assembly order, based on how the structure is built from the ground up, is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the steps:**\n* Step 1: The blue block (6) serves at the base.\n* Step 2: The brown block (7) is placed next to it on the first layer.\n* Step 3: The red block with cut (2) is added on top of two blocks.\n* Step 4: put green block(9) on the red block.\n* Step 5: put orange block(14) on the green block.\n"

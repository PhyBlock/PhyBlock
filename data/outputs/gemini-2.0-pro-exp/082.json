Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure appears to be composed of 7 blocks. It has three layers.\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two angled orange blocks.\n    *   The middle layer is a red block with a hole.\n    * the top layer consists of two yellow half-cylinder blocks and on top of these two, an angled orange block.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer's two angled orange blocks are placed side by side, but angled apart in mirror image.\n    *    The middle layer's red block is centered on top of the first layer, bridging the two blocks.\n    * The third layer's two yellow blocks are place on top of the red block.\n    * The angled orange block is centered on top.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Block 1: Red Block.\n*   Block 7: Yellow half-cylinder block.\n*  Block 12: Angled orange block\n*   Block 16: Angled orange block, mirrored.\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\n\n1, 7, 7, 12, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 16\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    step6: move block with index 12\n\n}\n```\n"

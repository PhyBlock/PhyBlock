Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows *two* distinct structures. Let's analyze them separately:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure appears to have 6 blocks in total. It has conceptually three layers. The bottom layer consists of four triangular prism blocks, The middle is one rectangular prism block, and the top of one triangular prism block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of four triangular prisms arranged, touching at their points, with the hypotenuse face down.\n    *   The middle layer consist of a cuboid with two square sides.\n    *   The top is single triangular prisms with it's hypotenuse face down.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 4 blocks. There are conceptually three layers: two vertical cylinders on the bottom, and two rectangular blocks on the top, bridging them.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two cylinders are parallel to each other, spaced apart.\n    *    The rectangular block rest, side by side, bridging the two cylinders.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the list of block indices needed:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Triangular prism (pointed upwards): 16 (x5)\n*   Blue Cuboid: 2 (x1)\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Vertical Cylinder: 6 (x2)\n*   Horizontal Rectangular Block (Yellow): 5 (x2)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence for each structure:\n\n**Structure 1**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 16\n    Step2: Move block with index 16\n    Step3: Move block with index 16\n    Step4: Move block with index 16\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\n**Structure 2**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n\n}\n```\n"

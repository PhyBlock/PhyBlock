I will focus on the house-like structure on the right side of the main image, as it seems to be the more complex structure requiring step-by-step instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image (House Structure):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The house structure consists of 7 blocks. It has 4 layers:\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two blocks (Green and Orange).\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two blocks. (Blue and Orange)\n    *    **Layer 3:** One block (yellow).\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top):** Two blocks(two orange roof pieces).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer has two square blocks side-by-side, a green one on the viewer's left and a orange one on the right.\n    *   The Second layer has two square blocks side-by-side, a blue one on the viewer's left and a orange one on the right.\n    *   The thrid layer, consists of a single yellow square block, centered on top of the first two layers.\n    *   The top layer consists of two triangular roof pieces, completing the house shape.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the block dictionary image:\n\n*   **Block Index 2:** Green Square Block.\n*   **Block Index 3:** Orange Square Block.\n*    **Block Index 1:** Blue Square Block\n*   **Block Index 3:** Orange Square Block.\n*   **Block Index 4:** Yellow Square Block.\n*   **Block Index 14:** Orange roof.\n*   **Block Index 16:** Orange roof.\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n\n}\n```\n"

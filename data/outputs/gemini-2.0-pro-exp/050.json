Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 6 blocks. It has conceptually three layers:\n    *   Bottom Layer: A single horizontal green rectangular block.\n    *   Middle Layer: Two vertical yellow rectangular blocks on the sides and one red and one blue cube in between.\n    *   Top Layer: A single Horizontal green rectangular block.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer green block supports the entire structure.\n    *   The middle layer has two yellow blocks standing vertically, flanking the two center cubes (red and blue).\n    *   The Red cube is at the bottom, and the Blue cube is on top of it.\n    *   The top layer consists of a Green block which lies on top of the yellow blocks, horizontally.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   One Horizontal Green Rectangular Block (Bottom Layer). Looking at the dictionary, this corresponds to block index **10**.\n*   Two vertical yellow rectangular blocks. This corresponds to block index **13**. We need two of these.\n*   One Red Cube. Index **4**.\n*   One Blue Cube. Index **1**.\n*    One Horizontal Green Rectangular Block (Top Layer). Looking at the dictionary, this corresponds to block index **10**.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 10, 13, 13, 4, 1, 10\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is inferred based on the layering and support structure:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n1. Place the green block(10) at the base.\n2. Put the Red Cube(4)\n3. Stack the Blue Cube (1) on top of the red one.\n4. Place one yellow rectangular block(13) vertically.\n5. Place one yellow rectangular block(13) vertically.\n6. Finally, cap the structure with another green block(10).\n"

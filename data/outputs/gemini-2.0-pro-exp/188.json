            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the task and the solution based on the provided images.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures. Let's analyze them separately:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left - \"Chair-like\"):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 5 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    *   Layer 1: Two vertical orange cylinders.\n    *   Layer 2: One horizontal yellow rectangular prism.\n    *   Layer 3: One Vertical orange cyclinder.\n    *   Layer 4: One yellow, half cyclinder.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two cylinders on the base layer are parallel and spaced apart.\n    *   The rectangular prism sits across the top of the two cylinders, connecting them.\n    *  Another orange cyclinder sit on top of the yellow rectangular prism.\n    * The half cyclinder is on top of the orange cyclinder.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right - \"House-like\"):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 5 blocks, seemingly arranged in 3 layers.\n    *   Layer 1: Two orange triangular prisms, placed at an angle to form a sort of wider base.\n    *   Layer 2: Two, vertical, blue rectangular prism\n    *   Layer 3: One orange triangular prisms placed with to for the 'roof'.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The triangular prisms on the base are angled such that they converge towards the viewer.\n    *   The rectangular prims sit on top of layer 1 blocks.\n    *   The top triangular prism rests with flat side on the rest of the block, with the point facing upward, forming the \"roof\".\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the list of block indices needed:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Orange Cylinders (Vertical): Block Index 6 (Used three times)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism (Horizontal): Block Index 5\n    *   Yellow, half cyclinder: Block Index 7\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Orange Triangular Prisms (Angled): Block Index 12 (used twice)\n    *   Blue Rectangular Prisms: Block Index 2 (used twice)\n    *   Orange, roof, triangular Prism: Block Index 11\n\n**Total Block Indices Required:** 6, 6, 5, 6, 7, 12, 12, 2, 2, 11.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence, presented in the required format:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n\n}\n```\n**Explanation of assembly order:**\n*   **Structure 1** is assembled first. The base cylinders (6) are placed, then the connecting prism (5), then the last cylinder(6), then the half cylinder(7).\n*   **Structure 2** is assembled second. The angled base prisms (12) are placed, followed by the rectangular prisms(2) and finalize with the 'roof' block(11).\n\nThis sequence builds the structures from the ground up, ensuring stability and matching the target image. The key is to visualize how each block supports the next.\n"

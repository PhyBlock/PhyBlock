Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 6 blocks. It has two layers: a base layer made of two red arch-shaped blocks, and a second layer consisting of four rectangular blocks (two yellow, two green).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** The two red arch-shaped blocks are placed side-by-side, creating a larger arch.\n    *   **Second Layer:**\n        *   One yellow rectangle rests on the far left of the red blocks.\n        *   One green rectangle rests on the far right of the red blocks.\n        *   One yellow rectangle is in the middle, near the back.\n        *    One green rectangle is in the middle, near the front.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two red arch-shaped blocks. Looking at the dictionary, index `1` matches the required orientation.\n*   Two yellow rectangular blocks. One needs to be vertical, and the other needs to be vertical. Index `14` matches this oritentation.\n*   Two green rectangular block. One needs to be vertical, and the other needs to be vertical. Index `10` matches this orientation.\n\nTherefore, the list of block indices is: `1, 1, 10, 10, 14, 14`.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 1\nStep3: Move block with index 14\nStep4: Move block with index 10\nStep5: Move block with index 14\nStep6: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n"

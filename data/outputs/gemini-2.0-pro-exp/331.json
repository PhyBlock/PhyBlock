Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure in the main target image appears to be composed of 8 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure has multiple layers. The base layer consists of a red arch, two orange cylinders. The second layer is one green rectangle, and then one blue rectangle. The top layer is orange roof. There is another structure made by one yellow and two green rectangles.\n*  **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer: One red arch. One orange cylinder is beside the left side of the arch. Another orange cylinder is beside the right side of the arch.\n    *   The second layer: A green rectangle is on the top of the red arch.\n    *  The third layer: A blue rectangle is on the top of the green rectangle.\n    * The top layer: An orange roof shape is placed on top of the blue rectangle.\n    * Another Stucture: Two green rectangle located on left and right, and one yellow rectangle located inside of two green rectangle, which combines to form a rectangle.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed from the dictionary image:\n\n*   Red Arch: Block index 1\n*   Orange Cylinder: Block index 10 (Need two of these)\n*   Green rectangle: Block index 6\n*   Blue Rectangle: Block index 4\n*    Orange Roof: Block index 13\n*   Green rectangle: Block index 7(Need two of these)\n*    Yellow rectangle: Block index 8\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 10, 10, 6, 4, 13, 7, 7, 8.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the selected blocks, the assembly order is inferred as follows:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n"

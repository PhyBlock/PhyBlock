Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 4 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two separate blue rectangular blocks.\n    *   The middle layer has one yellow rectangular block placed on top and bridging the two blue blocks.\n    *   The top Layer consists of a red arch that sits upon the yellow block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 6 blocks and has 2 layers.\n    * An extended section.\n    * A cabin section.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two orange cylinders, placed parallel to each other.\n    *   A yellow block is placed across the cylinders.\n    *   A blue block sits atop the end of the yellow block.\n    *   A green block sits next to the blue block.\n    *   A red block sits beside the green block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed from the dictionary:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 6 (Blue rectangular block) - Used twice.\n    *   Block 8 (Yellow rectangular block).\n    *   Block 1 (Red arch).\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 11 (orange cylinders) - Used Twice\n    *   Block 8 (yellow rectangular)\n    *   Block 2 (blue cube)\n    *   Block 3 (green cube)\n    *   Block 5 (red cube)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence, divided by each section.\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n**Structure 2:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n}\n```\n"

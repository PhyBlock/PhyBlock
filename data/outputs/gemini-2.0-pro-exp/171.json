Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows two distinct structures:\n\n*   **Structure 1: A small \"car-like\" structure.**\n    *   **Count & Layers:** It consists of 3 blocks and has 2 layers.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   The bottom layer consists of a yellow rectangular block with concave sections, with two yellow small cyclinder block under it.\n        *   The top layer has a small, orange triangular prism sitting on top of the yellow base.\n\n*   **Structure 2: A tall, tower-like structure.**\n    *   **Count & Layers:** It has 5 blocks, including a circular cut-out block, with 3 layers.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   The base layer has a large red block, with a yellow rectangular block.\n        *   The second layer consists of 2 verical green blocks.\n        *    The top layer has 1 yellow rectangular block, and an orange triangular prism.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 11 (Yellow base)\n    *   Block 13 (Yellow small cylinder)\n    *    Block 13 (Yellow small cylinder)\n    *   Block 16 (Orange triangular prism)\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 2 (Red circular cut-out)\n    *   Block 9 (Yellow Rectangular)\n    *   Block 8 (Green Rectangular)\n    *   Block 8 (Green Rectangular)\n    *   Block 11 (Yellow Rectangular)\n    *  Block 15 (Orange triangular prism)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1 (Car):**\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 11\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 13\n   Step4: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n**Structure 2 (Tower):**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 3 blocks arranged in a single layer, but with varied heights.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two red \"U\" shaped blocks are placed horizontally, facing away from each other.\n    *   A blue cube is placed on top, bridging the gap between the two red blocks.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*    **Count & Layers:** 5 blocks. There are conceptually three layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n     * Bottom Layer: two yellow rectangular block placed horizontally\n     * The middle layer consists of two orange, vertically-oriented cylinders. They stand side-by-side on the yellow blocks.\n     * Top layer: A red arch-shaped block placed at the top and a oragne roof-shaped block on it.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block Index 2 (Red U-shaped, horizontal) - Used twice.\n    *   Block Index 6 (Blue Cube)\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n     *   Block Index 9 (yellow rectangular block) - Used twice\n     *   Block Index 12 (Orange cylinder) - Used twice\n     * Block Index 1 (red arch-shaped)\n     * Block index 14 (orange roof-shaped)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence, creating Structure 1 first, then Structure 2:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\nExplanation of steps\n1-3 build the left hand structure\n4 and 5 place the base layer of the right hand structure\n6 and 7 place the two pillars\n8 places the arch, and nine completes the structure.\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 13 blocks. It has two main layers: a base layer and an upper layer.  There's substructure in upper layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** Two red arch blocks form the foundation, with space between them.\n    *   **Upper Layer:**\n        *    Two yellow cylinder, lay on the base layer.\n        *   A blue cube is placed on the left arch.\n        *   A yellow cuboid is placed on the left cylinder.\n        *   A orange cuboid is placed on top of the blue cube.\n        *   A yellow cuboid is placed on the right cylinder.\n        *   A green cube is placed on the right arch.\n        *   A green cuboid is placed next to the green cube.\n        *   Two orange roof blocks are placed on top of the arches, one on the left, on the blue cube, and one on the right, on the green cube.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on my analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   1 (Red Arch): 2\n*   5 (Blue Cube): 1\n*   6 (Green Cube): 1\n*   8 (Green Cuboid): 1\n*   10(Yellow Cuboid): 2\n*   11 (Yellow Cuboid):1\n*   12 (Yellow Cylinder): 2\n*   14 (Orange Roof): 1\n*    15(Orange Roof):1\n*   7(Orange Cuboid):1\n\n**Total: 13 blocks**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 8\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n    Step12: Move block with index 14\n    Step13: Move block with index 15\n\n}\n```\n"

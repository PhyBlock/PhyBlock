            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the building process.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze the structure on the right, as it is more complex:\n\n*   **Block Count:** The right-hand structure appears to be made of 9 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure has 5 layers:\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Two blue rectangular blocks, with a wider, yellow block lying flat on top of them.\n    *   Layer 2: Two rectangular blocks: one red (laying horizontally) and one blue (laying horizontally, perpendicular to the red).\n    *   Layer 3: A horizontal green rectangular block.\n    *   Layer 4. Two orange triangular blocks\n    *    Layer 5: One complete orange triangular block.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer consists of the two blue blocks acting as supports, with the yellow block spanning across them like a bridge.\n    *    The following layers build upward, alternating in oriantation to provide some form of stability.\n    *   The top layer, which composes a triangular prism shape, is made from three orange blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices from the dictionary image:\n\n*   **Layer 1:**\n    *   Two blue rectangular blocks: Index 9 (x2)\n    *   One yellow rectangular block: Index 11\n*   **Layer 2:**\n     * One red retangular block: Index 7\n     * One blue rectangular block: index 9.\n*   **Layer 3:**\n    *    One green rectangular block: index 10\n*   **Layer 4**\n*     Two orange triangular blocks: Index 14 (x2)\n*   **Layer 5**\n    *   One orange triangular block: index 15.\n\n**Total Block Indices Needed:** 9, 9, 11, 7, 9, 10, 14, 14, 15.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of two distinct assemblies.\n    *   Assembly 1: Has 4 blocks and 4 layers.\n    *   Assembly 2: Has 4 blocks, seemingly organized into 2 \"layers\" if considering the cylinders as a base layer, and blocks on top of it as another.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *    Assembly 1:\n        -   A red arch-shaped block forms the base.\n        -   A green rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the arch.\n        -   A blue cube is placed on the green block.\n        -   An orange triangular prism (roof-shaped) tops the blue cube.\n    *   Assembly 2:\n        -  Two organge cylinders are put parallel.\n        -  A yellow rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the cylinders.\n        -  A blue cube is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block 1:** (Red Arch)\n*   **Block 3:** (Blue Cube) - *Used twice*\n*   **Block 6:** (Green Rectangle)\n*   **Block 7:** (Yellow Rectangle)\n*    **Block 10:** (Orange cylinder) - *Used twice*\n*   **Block 14:** (Orange Triangular Prism)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n"

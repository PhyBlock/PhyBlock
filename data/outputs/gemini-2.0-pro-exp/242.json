Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two structures. We will focus on recreating the larger, more complex structure on the right, as it encapsulates most of the challenges. The smaller structure on the left may be disregarded to simplify the task.\n\n*   **Count & Layers (Right Structure):**\n    *   The structure appears to have 8 blocks.\n    *There are multiple layers: a base made up of one cylinder. A level that had a Green block, a blue, and a yellow. A red layer, and finally the top yellow layer.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There's a foundational tall, orange cylinder.\n    *   on top of the cylinder, there is a green rectangular block.\n    *   To the right, in the same layer is the yellow rectangular block.\n    *   on top of it is a blue cube.\n    *   on top of the blue and the green blocks there is a red one, with an empty half-cylinder shape.\n    * on top of this one, there are two yellow \"half roof\" blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   10 (Orange Cylinder)\n    *   5 (Green Rectangular Block)\n    *    4 (Yellow block)\n    *   3 (Blue Cube)\n    *    2 (red block)\n    *   12 (Yellow \"half roof\" - to create the roof)\n    *   13 (Yellow \"half roof\" - to create the roof)\n    * 15 (orange block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 15\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the building steps.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of two distinct parts.\n    *   The left part appears to have 7 blocks. There seem to be at least two layers, potentially three if we consider the orange triangle leaning.\n    *   The right part contains 4 blocks on 3 stacked layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Part:**\n        *   Two triangular prisms (orange) act as supports on opposite sides, at a slight angle, leaning against vertical blocks.\n        *   Two green rectangular blocks are placed vertically.\n        *    One orange cylinder is positioned vertically between the green blocks.\n        *   One orange arch block spans accross the top of the vertical blocks.\n\n    * **Right part:**\n         *   A base layer contains two square face blocks (green, blue).\n         *  Second layer with a red block with a hole\n         *   A green rectangular top block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **Left structure**\n    *   Orange triangular prism: 13, 15\n    *   Green rectangular block (vertical): 5, 5\n    *   Orange cylinder (Vertical): 7\n    *    Orange arch: 11\n\n* **Right Structure**\n    * Green Square: 3\n    * Blue Square: 2\n    * Red Arch: 1\n    * Green Rectangular block (horizontal): 4\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a proposed step-by-step assembly sequence:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n\n}\n```\n**Explanation of Assembly Order:**\n*   **Steps 1-4** build the isolated right structure, starting with its green and blue base, red center and adding the green top.\n* **Steps 5-10** construct the left structure by placing one green column, an angled base, then continuing the layers by placing an orange cylinder, another green block, the opposing angled block and finally the orange arch on top.\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of one block. It has only one layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The block is a red, C-shaped prism, and is positioned horizontally.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:** I need the block that matches the shape, color, and orientation of the block in the target image.\n*   **List Block Indices:** Based on the Block Dictionary Image, the required block index is: `2`\n*  **Matching Criteria** The block with ID 2 has been selcted as it has a matching shape and, critically, the correct rotational orientation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** Since it's only a single block, the assembly order is straightforward.\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them one by one:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 3 blocks. It seems has 2 layers .\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer consists of two red arch-shaped blocks, placed side-by-side.\n    *   The second layer has one green rectangular block laid horizontally and centered on top of the two arch blocks.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 5 blocks. It can be considered as 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *    The base layer contains two yellow, horizontally oriented blocks.\n    *    Then, two green, vertically oriented rectangular blocks are placed on top of the yellow blocks.\n    *    One orange triangular block is placed on top of the green blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Two red arch-shaped blocks: Block index **2** (used twice)\n*   One green horizontal rectangular block: Block index **5**\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*    Two yellow horizontal rectangular block: Block index **8** (used two times)\n*   Two green vertical rectangular blocks: Block index **7** (used twice)\n*   One orange triangular block: Block index **13**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n}\n```\n\n**Structure 2:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

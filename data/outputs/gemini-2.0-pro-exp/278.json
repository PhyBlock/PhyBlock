Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks. It appears to have two main \"groupings\" of blocks, but can generally be described as having primarily one layer at the bottom, with a single block on top for the first group.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Group 1 (Left Side):** Two red \"arch\" shaped blocks are side-by-side, forming a base. A blue cube sits on top of these two red blocks, centered.\n    *   **Group 2 (Right Side):** Two yellow half-cylinder blocks are arranged side by side, creating a base with a flat top. A green cube is located on top of one of the yellow, next to it is a blue.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Two red \"arch\" blocks: Block index **3** (two times)\n*   One blue cube: Block index **6**\n*   Two yellow half-cylinder: Block index **11** (two times)\n*   One green cube: Block index **7**\n*   One blue cube: Block index: **6**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 3, 3, 6, 11, 11, 7, 6\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order would be to build each sub structure.\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 3\nStep2: Move block with index 3\nStep3: Move block with index 6\nStep4: Move block with index 11\nStep5: Move block with index 11\nStep6: Move block with index 7\nStep7: Move block with index 6\n}\n"

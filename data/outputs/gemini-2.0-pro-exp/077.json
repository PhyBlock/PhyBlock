Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks. There are conceptually three layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** A red arch-shaped block, and two orange wedge shaped blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Two cube blocks: one green and one blue.\n    *    **Top Layer:** Two orange triangular prism blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The red arch-shaped block forms the central base.\n    *   The two orange wedge-shaped blocks sit on each side, next to the ends of the red arch.\n    *   The green cube block is placed directly on top of the left side of the arch.\n    *   The blue cube block is placed directly on top of the right side of the arch, adjacent to the green block.\n    *    The two orange triangular prism blocks sit on top of the green and blue blocks, forming a roof.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Block 1 (Red Arch)\n*   Block 6 (Green Cube)\n*   Block 5 (Blue Cube)\n*   Block 15 (Orange Wedge 1)\n*   Block 14 (Orange Wedge 2)\n*  Block 10 (Orange triangular prism 1)\n*  Block 12 (Orange triangular prism 2)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 6, 5, 15, 14, 10, 12.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n\n}\n```\n"

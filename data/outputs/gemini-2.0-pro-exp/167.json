Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure consists of 14 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure can be conceptually divided into three layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** Four red arch-shaped blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Three yellow rectangular blocks, and Two green rectangular blocks.\n    *   **Top Layer:** Two red rectangular blocks, two blue rectangular blocks, one orange triangluar block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer is formed by four red arches arranged to create gaps.\n    *   Two yellow rectangluar blocks, are resting horizontally, bridging the gaps between the red arches, and one yellow block laying horizontally in the other direction.\n    *   Two green blocks are stacked upon the central yellow block.\n    *   One blue block is stacked on top of the green block. Beside it and laying on the yellow block, there is another blue block.\n    *  Two red rectangular blocks are stacked on top of the first two yellow blocks.\n    *  Finally one orange triangluar block is placed on the highest blue block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **Red Arches:** 1, 1, 1, 1 (Four instances of block 1)\n*   **Yellow Rectangular:** 9, 9, 10 (Two instances of block 9 and one of block 10)\n*    **Green Rectangular:** 5, 5 (Two instances of block 5)\n*   **Blue Rectangular:** 7, 8 (One instances of block 7 and one of 8)\n*   **Red Rectangular:** 2, 2 (Two instances of block 2)\n*    **Orange Triangular:** 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence, following the specified format:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 5\n    Step10: Move block with index 7\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 2\n    Step13: Move block with index 2\n    Step14: Move block with index 15\n\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 9 blocks. It can be conceptually divided into three layers:\n    *   Base Layer: A single horizontal rectangular block.\n    *   Middle Layer: Two vertical cylindrical blocks, supporting a horizontal rectangular block.\n    *   Top Layer: Two blue rectangular blocks. One red block. Two orange triangular blocks connected and making a roof.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer is a yellow, horizontally-oriented rectangular block.\n    *   Two orange, vertically-oriented cylindrical blocks rest on the base, side-by-side but separated.\n    *   A yellow, horizontally-oriented rectangular block rests on top of the two cylinders, spanning the gap.\n    *   The top layer has two blue, vertically-oriented rectangular blocks,side by side.\n    *   The top layer has one red, vertically-oriented rectangular block.\n    *   Two mirrored orange, triangular blocks are combined and make a triangular roof.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are needed:\n\n*   Base Layer:\n    *   Index 9 (Yellow, horizontal rectangular block)\n*   Middle Layer:\n    *   Index 10 (Orange, vertical cylinder) - Used twice.\n    *   Index 7 (Yellow, horizontal rectangular block)\n*    Top Layer:\n    *   Index 4 (Blue, vertically-oriented rectangular blocks)\n    *   Index 6 (Blue, vertically-oriented rectangular blocks)\n    *   Index 2 (Red, vertically-oriented rectangular blocks)\n    *   Index 12 (Orange triangular)\n    *   Index 16 (Orange triangular)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 9, 10, 10, 7, 4, 6, 2, 12, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n\n}\n```\n"

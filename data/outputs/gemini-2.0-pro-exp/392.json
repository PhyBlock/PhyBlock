Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 14 blocks, arranged across roughly three layers.\n    *   **Base Layer:** There are at least 4 blocks, 3 visible.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Yellow platform. Made of 3 blocks.\n    *    **Layer 3:** Mix of red and orange roof blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer consists of four orange cylinders.\n    *   The Second Layer has three yellow blocks in a 2x1 configuration.\n    *   The top layer sits on these, with the other mixed color blocks built up.\n    *    On the left is one yellow block, one green block, one blue block, and one red block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the provided dictionary image:\n\n*   Block 12 (Orange Cylinder): x4\n*   Block 11 (Yellow): x2\n*    Block 9 (Yellow):x1\n*   Block 1 (Red Arc): x1\n*   Block 4 (Red Arc): x1\n*   Block 6 (Yellow Cube): x1\n*   Block 8 (Green): x1\n*   Block 5 (Blue Cube): x1\n*   Block 15 (Orange roof):x1\n*    Block 14(Orange roof): x1\n\n**Total blocks to be used are 14.**\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n    Step12: Move block with index 8\n    Step13: Move block with index 5\n    Step14: Move block with index 1\n\n}\n```\n"

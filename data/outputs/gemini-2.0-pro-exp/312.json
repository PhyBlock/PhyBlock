Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Counts & Layers:** The structure consists of two distinct parts. The larger, more complex part on the left is made of approximately 9 blocks. It appears to have three layers. The structure on the right is built of 5 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   **Base Layer:** Two red arch blocks (like upside-down \"U\"s) form the foundation, positioned side-by-side.\n        *   **Middle Layer:** A yellow rectangular block rests horizontally across the two arch blocks. Green block, blue block and yello block.\n        *   **Top Layer:** An orange, triangular prism block sits atop the green cube.\n    *  **Right Structure:**\n        * Has three red blocks, blue block and green block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are needed:\n\n*   **Left Structure:**\n    *   Two of Block 1 (Red Arch)\n    *   One of Block 14 (Yellow Rectangle)\n    *\tOne of Block 5 (Green block)\n    *   One of Block 4 (Blue block)\n    *   One of Block 12 (Yellow block)\n    *\tOne of Block 16 (Orange block)\n    *\tOne of Block 6 (Red block)\n*     **Right Structure:**\n     *\tOne of Block 10 (Green block)\n     *   One of Block 8 (Blue block)\n     *  Three of Block 6 (Red block)\n     *   One of Block 13 (Yellow block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 6\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n    Step12: Move block with index 8\n    Step13: Move block with index 10\n    Step14: Move block with index 13\n\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 10 blocks, arranged in what can be considered 3 primary layers.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Four arch-shaped red blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Two green rectangular block and two yellow rectangular block.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** One yellow rectangular block, upon which a orange cylindrical block and orange triangular prism is placed.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The first group: Two red arch blocks form the base, with a yellow block laid horizontally across them, and another two red arch block is stacked on the yellow block.\n    *    The second group: Two red arch blocks form the base, with a green rectangular block stacked directly on top, followed by yellow rectanglar block, and finalized by an orange cylindrical block and orange triangular prism stacked vertically.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **Red Arch:** Index 1 (4 times)\n*   **Green Rectangular Block:** Index 7 (1 time)\n*   **Yellow Rectangular Block:** Index 10 (3 times)\n*  **Orange Cylindrical Block**: Index 12 (1 time)\n* **Orange Triangular Block**: Index 13 (1 time)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n\n}\n```\n"

            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the build process.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks.  It has two primary layers: a base layer and a top layer sitting on the base.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** The base is composed of two orange cylindrical blocks lying horizontally and parallel to each other, acting like wheels or supports. Two yellow rectangular blocks laying horizontally that bridges the cylindrical ones.\n    *   **Top Layer:**  On top of the base, in the center, is a blue cube. Adjacent and to the right of the blue cube is a red cube.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two orange cylinders lying horizontally: Block index **13** (used twice)\n*   Two yellow rectangular block laying horizontally: Block index **10** (used twice)\n*   One blue cube: Block index **1**\n*  One red cube: Block index **4**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 13, 13, 10, 10, 1, 4\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 13\nStep2: Move block with index 13\nStep3: Move block with index 10\nStep4: Move block with index 10\nStep5: Move block with index 1\nStep6: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n1. place the orange cylinder.\n2. place the Second orange cylinder.\n3. place one of the yellow rectangular blocks to connect to the top of the cylinders.\n4. place second yellow rectanglar block to connect to the top of the cylinders, thus the base is complete.\n5. put the blue cube to the center of the base.\n6. place red cube to the right of the blue cube.\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks arranged in roughly 4 layers.\n    *   Layer 1 (Base): Two vertical cylindrical blocks.\n    *   Layer 2: One long horizontal rectangular block.\n    *   Layer 3: A bridge shaped block, and cylinderical block and top of it a triangular prism.\n    *   Layer 4: An arched block and triangular prism on top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer has two cylinderical blocks, parallel to each other.\n    *   The second layer has one rectangular block, placed horizontally on top of and perpendicular to the two base blocks.\n    *   The bridge-shaped block rests on the yellow block, and the red triangular prism on top, creates a small roof-like structure.\n    *    A long, vertical cylinder is put on the second layer, and a triangular prism is on top of this cylinder.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Block 8 (Orange Cylinder): x 3\n*   Block 7 (Yellow Rectangular Block): x 1\n*   Block 1 (Red Arch): x 1\n*   Block 15 (red triangular prism): x 2\n*  Block 10 (yellow bridge): x 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

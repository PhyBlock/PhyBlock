Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 5 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer is a yellow rectangular block.\n    *   The middle layer consists of a red block with a cylindrical hole.\n    *   The top layer has two orange cylinders in a vertical position, and a yellow rectangular on top of the two cylinders.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 5 blocks, also with 3 visible layers.\n    * One additional block is hiden, but is the buttom layer for supporting other blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer is a green rectangular block.\n    *   An orange, vertical cylinder sits on top of the base.\n    *   The next layer features two green rectangular blocks arranged vertically, forming an opening, and one yellow rectangular on the top.\n    *   A orange triangle is put inside the green and yellow blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Block 10 (Yellow Rectangular Block, base)\n*   Block 2 (Red Block with Cylindrical Hole)\n*   Block 11 (Orange Cylinder, vertical) x 2\n*   Block 10 (Yellow Rectangular Block, top)\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Block 4 (Green Rectangular Block)\n*   Block 11 (Orange Cylinder)\n*   Block 6 (Green Rectangular Block) x2\n*    Block 10 (Yellow Rectangular Block)\n*   Block 16 (Orange Triangle)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n}\n\n**Structure 2:**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n}\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Counts & Layers:** The structure can be broadly divided into two sub-assemblies:\n    *   A \"car-like\" structure on the left.\n    *   A \"building-like\" structure on the right.\n\n    *Car-Like Structure:*\n    *   Layer 1: One yellow rectangular block, two orange cylinders.\n    *   Layer 2: One blue cube and one red cube.\n\n    *Building-Like Structure:*\n    *   Layer 1: Two yellow rectangular blocks, and three orange cylinders.\n    *   Layer 2: One red arch-like block.\n    *   Layer 3: two red triangluar blocks.\n* **Block Count:** 13\n* **Number of layers:** 3\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   *Car-Like Structure:*\n        *   The cylinders are attached to the underside of the yellow rectangular block, likely at the ends.\n        *    The blue and red cubes sit on top of the long yellow block.\n    *   *Building-Like Structure:*\n        *   Three cylinders placed vertically on the ground.\n        *   Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horzontally, and put on top of the three cylinders.\n        *   Red arch is sitting on the two yellow rectangular block.\n        *   Two triangluar blocks constructs a roof, and is put on the red arch.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Block 1 (Red arch) x 1\n*   Block 4 (Blue Cube) x 1\n*   Block 7 (red cube) x 1\n*   Block 8 (Yellow Rectangular Block) x 3\n*   Block 10 (Orange Cylinder) x 5\n*   Block 14(Red triangluar block) x 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n    Step10: Move block with index 8\n    Step11: Move block with index 10\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n"

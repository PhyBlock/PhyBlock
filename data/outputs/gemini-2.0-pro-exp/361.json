Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n    *   **Structure 1 (Left):** This structure consists of 3 blocks. It has two layers: a bottom layer made of two \"C\" shaped blocks and a top \"cap\" layer.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Right):** This structure appears to have 6 blocks, also with bottom, middle, and top layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:**\n        *   Two \"C\" shaped red blocks that create a cylinder, side by side.\n        *   One Yellow 'cap' that is on top of the red blocks.\n    *   **Structure 2:**\n        *    A bottom yellow cap, two blocks, one blue and one red on top. Two Green blocks on top of those, and then finally a Yellow cap, all stacked vertically.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Index 5 (Red \"C\" block) - Used Twice\n    *   Index 14 (Yellow Flat Block)\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *    Index 13(Yellow Flat Block)\n    *   Index 7 (Blue Cube)\n    *   Index 8 (Red Cube)\n    *   Index 11(Green Rectangular Block) - Used twice\n    *    Index 14 (Yellow Flat Block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n\n}\n```\n**Explanation of Assembly Order:**\n*   Steps 1,2 Build the first structure base with blocks.\n*   Step 3: Place yellow cap.\n*   Step 4: Build second structure's yellow base.\n*    Steps 5, 6: place the blue and red blocks on top.\n*   Steps 7,8: Place the Green blocks on the next layer.\n*   Step 9: Put the last yellow block on top.\n\n"

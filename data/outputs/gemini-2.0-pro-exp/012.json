            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the task and the solution based on the provided images.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 9 blocks in total. It appears to have two layers: a base layer and a top layer sitting directly on the base.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** There are four orange wedge-shaped blocks forming a square base, a small blue block in the center, with 2 large blue blocks on the sides of the central block.\n    *    **Top Layer:** A green square block rests precisely in the center on top of the central blue block, and a small blue block is placed on top of the green square block.\n    *    The wedges touch along their sloped edges, the small blue blocks and large blocks touch.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, these are the required blocks:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   4 x Block 14 (Orange wedges)\n    *   1 x Block 2 (Green square)\n    *   2 x Block 6 (large blue block)\n    *   2 x Block 5 (small blue block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 14\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 5\n\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n1. Placing one of the small blue blocks on what is designated as the ground.\n2. Add the large blue blocks to each side.\n3. Add one orange wedge.\n4. Add the second, third, and fourth orange wedges, completing the circular base. The order of these four isn't critical, as long as they end up arranged as shown.\n5. Place the green square block on top of the blue block, in the center of the orange base.\n6. Add the last blue block on top.\n\n"

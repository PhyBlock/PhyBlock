Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 6 blocks. It has conceptually two layers: a base layer made from a central red piece, and 2 green side pieces, and then the cap formed by two yellow pieces and another central red piece forming the top layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer consists of a central red, C-shaped block.\n    *   One green block stands vertically on each side of red block base.\n    *   The top layer consists of a similar red, C-shaped block in the center.\n    *   A yellow rectangular block sits horizontally above and flush with each of the green blocks, touching top red blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two red \"C\" shaped blocks: One facing left and one facing right.\n*   Two vertically oriented green rectangular blocks.\n*   Two horizontally oriented yellow rectangular blocks.\n\nFrom the Block Dictionary Image, the following indices correspond to the required blocks:\n\n*   Red C-Shaped Blocks: Index 2, Index 6\n*   Green Rectangular Blocks (Vertical): Index 9, Index 9\n*   Yellow Rectangular Blocks (Horizontal): Index 14, Index 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order can be inferred as follows: build from base up and from center outwards:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 14\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

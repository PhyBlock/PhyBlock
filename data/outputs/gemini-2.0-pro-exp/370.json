Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 9 blocks. It can be conceptually divided into two sub-structures:\n    *   Sub-structure 1 (Left): This part has 4 blocks and appears to have three layers, if we include the very bottom red curved pieces.\n    *   Sub-structure 2 (Right): This section use 5 blocks, and seems to be 4 layers tall.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Sub-structure 1:** Two red curved blocks form the base. A green rectangular block is on top of the curved ones, with the long edge bridging the two. A larger red curved block is sitting on the top of the green block.\n    *    **Sub-structure 2:** Two red curved block forms the base. A blue cube block sitting on top of the curved blocks. A green rectangular block sits on top of the blue block, bridging the gaps. A larger red curved block is on the top of the green block. And a orange triangle block is put on the very top of the whole structure.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Red curved blocks (base): Index 1 (4 times)\n*   Green rectangular block: Index 9 (2 times)\n*   Blue Cube Block: Index 5 (once)\n*    Orange Triangle Block: Index 15 (once)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

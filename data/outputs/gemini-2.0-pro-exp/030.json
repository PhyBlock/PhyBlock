Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 4 blocks. There seem to be conceptually three layers:\n    *   Base Layer: Two triangular prism blocks.\n    *    Middle layer: One cyclinder\n    *   Top Layer: A \"U\" shaped block on top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two triangular blocks form the base. They are not touching.\n    *   One cyclinder is standing upright, positioned centrally on top of the triangular block.\n    *   The \"U\" shaped is on the very top, and it seems balance on the cyclinder.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Two Triangular prism, orange color: Block index 13, and 15\n*   One cyclinder, orange color: Block index 7\n*   One \"U\" shape block, red color: Block index 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

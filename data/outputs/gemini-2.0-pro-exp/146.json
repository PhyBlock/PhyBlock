Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks. It has multiple layers. We can consider the ground as layer 0. The two orange cylinders form layer 1. Layer 2 comprise of one yellow and one combined red/yellow arch. Layer 3 is a single orange cylinder. The very top is a triangular prism, on layer 4.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two orange cylinders are on the ground level (layer 1), side-by-side, but spaced apart.\n    *   A long, flat yellow block spans the two cylinders, connecting them at their tops (layer 2).\n    *   A red/yellow arched block sits atop the yellow block, centered (layer 2)\n    *   A tall orange cylinder is placed vertically on top of one of the bottom cylinders, in the center. (Layer 3)\n    *   A triangular, orange, prism like block tops the long orange cylinder. (layer 4)\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two orange cylinders: Block index 8 (used twice)\n*   One long yellow flat block: Block index 7\n*   One red/yellow arch: Block Index 1\n*    One Tall Orange Cylinder: Block Index 13.\n*   One Orange Triangle/Prism: Block index 14.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 8, 8, 7, 1, 13, 14.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

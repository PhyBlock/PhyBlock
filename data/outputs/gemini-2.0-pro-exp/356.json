Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 13 blocks. There are conceptually three layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** Four red arch blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Four blocks - One yellow long rectangular, two green rectangular, one blue cube.\n    *  **Top Layer:** Four blocks of different shapes. From left, one yellow rectangle, one light green rectangle, one yellow long rectangular and orange triangular prism .\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer is formed by four red arch-shaped blocks (two pairs, with each pair forming a longer arch support).\n    *   The middle layer spans across the two arch pairs. the yellow is in the middle.\n    *   There are four vertical blocks in the third level, two yellow, and one green, and one orange block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks from the dictionary image:\n\n*   Block 1 (Red Arch): x4\n*   Block 4 (Blue Cube): x1\n*   Block 12(Yellow rectangle): x2\n*   Block 7 (Light Green rectangle): x1\n*   Block 10(Green rectangle): x1\n*    Block 11 (Yellow long rectangle):x1\n*    Block 14(Orange Triangular Prism): x1\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12,12, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence, inferred from the structure:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7:Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n    Step11:Move block with index 14\n\n}\n```\n**Explanation of Assembly Order**\n1- build the ground with four red arch.\n2- Put the long yellow block, green, light green and blue block.\n3- Put the last layer.\n"

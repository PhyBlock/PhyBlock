            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures. Let's break them down:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left - Chair-like):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 5 blocks and has roughly three layers.\n    *   Layer 1: Two orange cylinders standing vertically.\n    *   Layer 2: A yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the two cylinders.\n    *    Layer3: one orange cylinder and a yellow half cylinder.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer consists of two vertical orange cylinders (9) spaced apart.\n    *   A horizontal yellow rectangular block (6) connects the two cylinders on top.\n    *    One vertical orange cyclinder(9) is on the yellow rectangular block.\n    *    One yellow half cyclinder is on the top of the orange cyclinder.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right - House-like):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 7 blocks, and approximately three layers.\n    * Layer 1: two orange cyclinder.\n    * Layer 2: A yellow rectanglar block.\n    * Layer 3: One red block, two blue block and two orange triangle blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base is formed by two orange cyclinders(9).\n    *   A yellow rectangular block(6) is on the top of the base.\n    *   A red block(1) is in the middle of the rectangular, and two blue blocks(4) are beside the red block.\n    *   Two orange triangle blocks(15) are as a roof.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the block indices needed:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   9 (Orange Cylinder, vertical) - Used three times.\n    *   6 (Yellow Rectangular, horizontal) - Used once\n    *    11(Yellow half cylinder) - Used once\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   9 (Orange Cylinder, vertical) - Used twice\n    *   6 (Yellow Rectangular, horizontal) - Used once.\n    *    1(Red Block) - Used Once\n    *   4(Blue Block) - Used twice\n    *   15(Orange triangle) - Used twice\n\n**Total Block Indices:** 9, 6, 11,1, 4, 15\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1 (Chair):**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\n**Structure 2 (House):**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

It has two layers:\n    *   Bottom Layer: Composed of four orange cylindrical blocks.\n    *   Top Layer: Composed of two green rectangular blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Bottom Layer: The four orange cylinders are arranged in a square formation, each cylinder being close to and potentially touching its adjacent cylinders. They are all standing upright.\n    *    Top Layer: two green blocks, that are horizontally aligned, placed on the center, covering the cylinders.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Four orange cylinders, standing upright: Block index 7 (from the dictionary image) is the upright orange cylinder. We need four of these.\n*   Two green blocks, horizontally aligned: Block index 1 and 2.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 2.\n* **Matching Criteria Check:** the blocks are the correct color, shape and orientation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

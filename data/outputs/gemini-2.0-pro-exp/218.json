Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 5 blocks in total, arranged in two layers.\n    *   Bottom Layer: 4 cylindrical orange blocks.\n    *   Top Layer: 1 rectangular green block, spanning across the four cylinders below.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The four orange cylinders are arranged in a square formation, touching each other at their sides.\n    *   The green rectangular block sits directly on top of the four cylinders, centered and covering them partially.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure is made of 3 blocks in total. There seems to be three layers of blocks.\n    *   Bottom Layer: 1 Yellow half-cylinder.\n    *   Middle Layer: 1 green rectangular.\n    *   Top Layer: 1 orange cylinder.\n*  **Spatial Relationships**:\n    * One yellow half-cylinder is at the base.\n    * One green rectangular block is on top, touching the curved portion.\n    * A long orange cylinder is positioned horizontally on top of the green block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Orange Cylinders: Block index 6 (Need four of these)\n    *   Green Rectangle: Block index 2\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *    Yellow Half-Cylinder: Block index 10\n    *   Green Rectangle: Block index 3\n    *   Orange Cylinder: Block index 8\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n\n**Structure 2**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n"

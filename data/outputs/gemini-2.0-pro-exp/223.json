            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures. Let's break them down:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 6 blocks. It can be considered to have 4 layers:\n    *   Layer 1: Two cylindrical blocks.\n    *   Layer 2: One rectangular block.\n    *   Layer 3: One cubic block.\n    *    Layer 4: One cubic block\n    *   Layer 5: One roof block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two cylinders are placed side-by-side, forming the base.\n    *   A flat, rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the cylinders.\n    *   One cubic block is put on top of the rectangular block.\n    *   Another cubic block is put on the cubic block in layer 3.\n    *   The roof block is on the very top.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 5 blocks, forming 3 layers.\n    *   Layer 1: Two cubic blocks.\n    *   Layer 2: One rectangular block.\n    *   Layer 3: Two roof blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two base cubes are side-by-side, with a slight gap. One is blue, the other is orange.\n    *   A long, flat, green rectangular block sits on top of the two base blocks, bridging them.\n    *   Two roof pieces that sit on top of the bridge.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n*   Block 10 (Orange Cylinder): x2\n*   Block 7 (green rectangular): x1\n*    Block 3 (orange cubic): x1\n*    Block 1 (blue cubic): x1\n*    Block 12 (Orange roof): x1\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Block 1 (Blue Cube): x1\n*   Block 3 (Orange Cube): x1\n*   Block 5 (Green Rectangular Block): x1\n*   Block 13 (Orange Roof): x2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 5\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n    Step11: Move block with index 13\n\n}\n```\n"

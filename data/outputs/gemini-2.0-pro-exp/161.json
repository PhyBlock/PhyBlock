Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 17 blocks, arranged in a seemingly complex structure with multiple layers. There's a base layer, a second layer, and in some areas, a third and forth layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There are two main sections to the structure: a section on the left with arches and a section on the right that is more rectangular.\n    *   **Left Section:** Two red arches form the base. Two half-circle yellow blocks rest on top of them. A Blue cube is on top of the left arch. A yellow vertical rectangle is next to the blue block. An orange cube is on the right arch. A light green rectangle connects the yellow and orange blocks.\n    *    **Right Section:** A yellow rectangular block laying flat, Two vertical green rectangle blocks supporting a yellow rectangle block on top. Two blue blocks are stacked and one red block is stacked below.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **1:** Two (Red Arches)\n*   **4:** Two (Blue Cubes)\n*  **5:** Two (Green Cubes)\n*  **6:** One (Orange Cube)\n* **7:** One (Red Cube)\n*   **8:** One (light Green Horizontal Rectangles)\n*   **9:** Two (Green Vertical Rectangles)\n*  **11:** Two (Yellow Horizontal Rectangle)\n* **13:** One (Yellow Vertical Rectangles)\n*   **14:** Two (Yellow Half-Circles)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n    Step11: Move block with index 14\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 13\n    Step14: Move block with index 6\n    Step15: Move block with index 8\n\n}\n```\n"

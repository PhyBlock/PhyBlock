Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure consists of 10 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure has two layers. The bottom layer has eight blocks, and the top has two.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There are two distinct sections in the structure.\n    *   The left section consists of four orange cylinders forming a base, with a flat green rectangular block lying horizontally on top of them.\n    *   The right section consists of two sets of yellow blocks and, in between them, two green blocks. The vertical yellow blocks support a long, yellow rectangular block lying on top of them.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required blocks and their indices:\n\n*   **Orange Cylinders (x4):** Block index 13 (four times)\n*    **Green rectangle (x1):** Block index 2 (one time)\n*   **Yellow Vertical Rectangles(x2):** Block index 10 (two times)\n*   **Green Vertical Rectangles(x2):** Block index 4 (two times)\n*    **Yellow rectangle (x1):** Block index 11 (one time)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 13, 13, 13, 13, 2, 10, 4, 4, 10, 11.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 13\nStep2: Move block with index 13\nStep3: Move block with index 13\nStep4: Move block with index 13\nStep5: Move block with index 2\nStep6: Move block with index 10\nStep7: Move block with index 4\nStep8: Move block with index 4\nStep9: Move block with index 10\nStep10: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The image shows two distinct structures. Let's analyze them separately:\n    *   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n        *   Blocks: 5\n        *   Layers: 3 (counting the base layer)\n    *   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n        *   Blocks: 9\n        *   Layers: 3 (counting the base layers)\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Structure 1**\n        1.  A long yellow rectangular block is the base.\n        2.  Two orange cylinders sit side-by-side on top of the yellow base, positioned towards one end.\n        3.  A yellow rectangular block, identical to the base block is put on top of the two cylinders.\n        4. A red arch is put on top of the second layer yellow block.\n        5. An orange triangular prism is stacked on top of the arch.\n    *   **Structure 2**\n        1.  Two red arches.\n        2.  One blue cube, two yellow half-cylinders, one yellow rectangular block, and one orange cube placed atop the red arches.\n        3. One green rectangular block on the right side of the structure, going down to the base level, one more green block put on the top of it.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   8 (Yellow Rectangular Block - used twice)\n    *   10 (Orange Cylinder - used twice)\n    *  15(Red Arch)\n    * 16(Orange triangular prism)\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   1 (Red Arch - used twice)\n    *   3 (Blue Cube)\n    *  11(Yellow Half Cylinder - used twice)\n    * 8 (Yellow Rectangular Block)\n    * 4 (Orange Cube)\n    *   7 (Green Rectangular Block - used twice)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\nHere is inferred assembly instructions.\n\nStructure 1:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\nStructure 2:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n"

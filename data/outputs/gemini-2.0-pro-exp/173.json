Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The target structure consists of two distinct, separate assemblies.\n    *   The first assembly (left side) has 4 blocks and 2 layers.\n    *    The second assembly (right side) has 4 blocks, best described as a single layer, although internal structure exists.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **First Assembly (Left):**\n        *   **Bottom Layer:** Three cylindrical blocks standing upright, side-by-side, touching each other.\n        *   **Top Layer:**  A green rectangular block lies horizontally on top of the three cylindrical blocks, bridging them.\n    *    **Second Assembly (Right):**\n         * A central red square block with a circular hole\n         * Side by side to that block, on both the left and right side, there is a green square block.\n         * Those three block are sandwiched by two identical yellow rectangular blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **First Assembly:**\n    *   Three orange cylinders (upright): Index 15 (used three times)\n    *   One green rectangular block (horizontal): Index 8\n*    **Second Assembly:**\n    *   One red square block with a circular hole: Index 6\n    *    Two green rectanglar blocks (vertical): Index 11\n    *   Two yellow rectangular blocks(horizontal): Index 14\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 15, 15, 15, 8, 6, 11, 11, 14, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 15\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 15\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the building instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 7 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Two red \"arch\" blocks (index 2) are placed parallel to each other, forming the base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block(index 11) is placed horizontally, balanced on top of the two arch blocks. A green cube (index 6) is on the yellow rectangular.\n    *   **Layer 3:** on the green cube, there is a red arch block.\n    *   **Layer4:** An orange triangular prism block(index 13) is balanced on top, forming a roof-like shape.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 6 blocks and has 3 layers visibly, though conceptually it's more like 1 base layer with decorations.\n*    **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Two yellow rectangular block.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A red cubic block(index 7), and a blue cubic block(index 5) are put on the top center of the base Layer 1.\n    *  **Layer 3**: Two green rectangular blocks(index 9), one on each side.\n    *  **Layer4:** One yellow rectangular block(index 11).\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   2 (Red Arch) - Used twice\n    *   11 (Yellow Rectangle) - Used once\n    *   6 (Green Cube)- Used once\n    *   3(Red Arch) - Used Once\n    *    13 (Orange Triangular Prism) - Used once\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   11 (Yellow Rectangle)- Used three times\n    *   5 (Blue cube)- Used Once\n    *   7 (Red cube)- Used once\n    *   9(Green Rectangle)-Used twice\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 5\n    Step11: Move block with index 9\n    Step12: Move block with index 9\n    Step13: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n"

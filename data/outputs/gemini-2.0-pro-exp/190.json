            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the task and the solution based on the provided images.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures. Let's analyze them separately:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left - House-like):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 8 blocks and has 4 layers.\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Two blue square blocks form the base.\n    *   Layer 2: One yellow rectangular block, lies horizontally on top of first layer.\n    *   Layer 3: one red square block lies in the middle of the yellow block. one Blue square block lies at the right of the red square block.\n    *   layer 4: one green rectangular block.\n    *   Layer 5 (Top): Two orange triangular blocks form a roof, meeting at a peak.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The blue blocks in the bottom layer are spaced apart.\n    *   The yellow block bridges the gap between the blue blocks.\n    *   The red and blue blocks are placed at the middle and right of the yellow block.\n    *    The green block lies on the top of red and blue blocks.\n    *   The two orange triangular blocks are positioned to create a slanted roof.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right - Arch-like):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure appears to use 6 blocks and has 3 layers if viewing the red block on top of the yellow block, and including the hollow space.\n    *   Layer 1: two green rectangular block.\n    *   Layer 2: Two yellow rectangular blocks. One red square block.\n    *   Layer 3: one green rectanglar block\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two base yellow blocks stand vertically, parallel to each other.\n    *   The red block is at the bottom, between the yellow blocks.\n    *  The green blocks are at the very bottom and top.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1 (House):**\n\n*   Blue square Block (base): Index 1 (x2)\n*   Yellow rectangular Block: Index 8 (x1)\n*  Red square Block: Index 2 (x1)\n* Blue square Block: Index 1 (x1)\n* Green rectangular Block: Index 5(x1)\n*   Orange Triangular Block (roof): Index 15 (x2)\n\n**Structure 2 (Arch):**\n\n*    Green rectanglar Block: Index 5 (x2)\n*   Yellow rectangular Block (vertical): Index 9 (x2)\n*   Red square Block: Index 2 (x1)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1 (House):**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n\n}\n```\n\n**Structure 2 (Arch):**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n}\n```\n\n**Summary**\nI have listed a series of assembly steps that use all of the necessary pieces to construct both models, according to the number and shape of blocks and their visible orientation.\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure appears to be built in two main sections, let's label from left to right section A and B.\n    *   Section A can be viewed as having 3 layers if we divide visually by the obvious color separation.\n    *    Section B is composed of 2 layers.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Section A:**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Two orange cylinders are placed vertically, side-by-side, but not touching.\n        *   Layer 2: One yellow, rectangular, horizontal block lays centered across the top of the two cylinders. Then a red arch block goes on top of yellow block\n        *   Layer 3: The orange roof is located on the top.\n\n    *   **Section B:**\n        *    Layer 1 (Bottom): One yellow horizontal block is placed, with one red ach block on the top.\n        *    Layer 2: A red arch is placed on top of Layer 1.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two orange cylinders (Index 11)\n*   Two yellow, rectangular, horizontal block (Index 8)\n*   Two red arch (Index 2)\n*   One orange roof (Index 13)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 11, 11, 8, 2, 13, 8, 2, 2.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

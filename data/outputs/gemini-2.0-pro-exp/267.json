Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure appears to have two main sections: a giraffe-like figure and a separate, star-like structure.\n    *   **Giraffe:**\n        *   It's made of multiple layers. The base has four cylindrical legs.\n        *   A rectangular body sits on top of the legs.\n        *   A cylindrical neck extends upwards.\n        *   A semi-circular piece forms the head.\n    * **Star-Like structure**\n        * Four triangular prism, with a square in the middle.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Giraffe:**\n        *   The four cylindrical legs are positioned at the corners of an imagined rectangle.\n        *   The rectangular body spans across the four legs, connecting them.\n        *   The cylindrical neck is placed vertically on top of the body, likely centered.\n        *   The semi-circular head sits atop the neck.\n    *   **Star-Like structure:**\n        *   Four orange triangular prism leaning against the side of a central, square shape.\n        *   The square has a green top surface, blue sides.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Giraffe:**\n    *   Four cylindrical legs: Block index 8 (x4)\n    *   Rectangular body: Block index 6 (x2)\n    *   Cylindrical neck: Block index 8 (x1)\n    *  semi-circular head: Block index 11 (x1)\n* Star-Like Structure:\n    * Four orange triangular prism : Block index 16 (x4)\n    * Central square: Block index 1 (top), 4 (x4, sides)\n\n**Total Blocks:**\n\n8,8,8,8,6,6,8,11,16,16,16,16,1,4,4,4,4\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a proposed step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n    Step10: Move block with index 16\n    Step11: Move block with index 16\n    Step12: Move block with index 16\n    Step13: Move block with index 1\n    Step14: Move block with index 4\n    Step15: Move block with index 4\n    Step16: Move block with index 4\n    Step17: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks.  It has two layers: a base layer and a top layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** Four orange wedge-shaped blocks form the base, arranged in a square-like configuration, each block angled outward. They surround two blue, vertically-oriented rectangular blocks at the center of the base layer.\n    *    **Top Layer:** A single green square block sits on top of the two blue rectangular blocks, completing the structure.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Four orange wedge-shaped blocks: Looking at the dictionary, the correct orientation is shown in indices **11, 12, 13, and 14**.\n*   Two Blue rectangular blocks, that are vertically-oriented: Looking at the dictionary, the correct orientation is show in index **9**.\n*    One Green Square block: index **2**.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 11, 12, 13, 14, 9, 9, 2.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 9\nStep2: Move block with index 9\nStep3: Move block with index 11\nStep4: Move block with index 12\nStep5: Move block with index 13\nStep6: Move block with index 14\nStep7: Move block with index 2\n}\n"

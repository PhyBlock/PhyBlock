Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure appears to have multiple layers.\n    *   The base layer consists of four cylindrical legs.\n    *   The second layer is a single long, flat, rectangular block.\n    *  The third layer has one blue cube, with two large angled orange blocks.\n    *   The top layer is a yellow half-cylinder.\n     There is a total of 9 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The four cylindrical blocks form the legs, positioned at the corners of an imaginary rectangle.\n    *   The long rectangular block sits atop the four legs, connecting them.\n    *    The blue cube rests on top of rectangular yellow block, positioned approximately at the horizontal center, and the orange angled pieces lay adjacent to the cube.\n    *   The yellow half-cylinder sits atop the very top orange angled piece.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Four orange cylinders (for the legs): Block index **8** (used four times)\n*   One yellow rectangular block: Block index **4**\n*   One blue cube: Block index **1**\n*   Two orange Angled blocks: Block index **14,** and **15**\n*    One Yellow half-cylinder: Block index **10**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 1, 14, 15, 10\n\n**3. Determination of the Assembly Order:**\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 8\nStep2: Move block with index 8\nStep3: Move block with index 8\nStep4: Move block with index 8\nStep5: Move block with index 4\nStep6: Move block with index 1\nStep7: Move block with index 15\nStep8: Move block with index 14\nStep9: Move block with index 10\n}\n"

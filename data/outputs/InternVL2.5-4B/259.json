    "instruction": "<IMG_CONTEXT><IMG_CONTEXT>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

    "predict": "### Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n- **Block Count**: The structure uses 16 blocks in total.\n- **Layers**: The structure has 4 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships**:\n  - **Top Layer**: \n    - A red rectangular block with a hole.\n    - A yellow rectangular block with a hole.\n  - **Second Layer**:\n    - Two red cylindrical blocks.\n    - Two yellow rectangular blocks.\n  - **Third Layer**:\n    - A red rectangular block.\n    - A yellow rectangular block.\n  - **Bottom Layer**:\n    - Two red rectangular blocks.\n    - Two yellow rectangular blocks.\n\n### Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are:\n\n1. Red rectangular block with a hole (index 1)\n2. Yellow rectangular block with a hole (index 5)\n3. Red cylindrical block (index 7)\n4. Yellow rectangular block (index 6)\n5. Red rectangular block (index 13)\n6. Yellow rectangular block (index 14)\n7. Red rectangular block (index 15)\n8. Yellow rectangular block (index 16)\n\n### Assembly Order\n\n1. Move block with index 1\n2. Move block with index 5\n3. Move block with index 7\n4. Move block with index 6\n5. Move block with index 13\n6. Move block with index 14\n7. Move block with index 15\n8. Move block with index 16\n\nThis sequence ensures the structure matches the desired layout exactly."

    "instruction": "<|image_pad|><|image_pad|>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

    "predict": "### Main Target Image Analysis\n\nThe main target image shows a structure composed of various building blocks. Here is a detailed description:\n\n- **Blocks Used**: The structure is made up of 16 blocks in total.\n- **Layers**: The structure has 4 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships**:\n  - The bottom layer consists of a green rectangular block, a yellow rectangular block, and a red rectangular block.\n  - The second layer has a red rectangular block, a yellow rectangular block, and a red triangular block.\n  - The third layer has a green rectangular block, a yellow rectangular block, and a red triangular block.\n  - The top layer has a blue rectangular block and a red rectangular block.\n\n### Block Dictionary Image Analysis\n\nThe block dictionary image contains 16 sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation. Each sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n### Required Blocks Selection\n\nBased on the analysis of the main target image, the required blocks from the dictionary are:\n\n- **Block 1**: Green rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 2**: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 3**: Red rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 4**: Red triangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 5**: Green rectangular block (vertical orientation)\n- **Block 6**: Yellow rectangular block (vertical orientation)\n- **Block 7**: Red rectangular block (vertical orientation)\n- **Block 8**: Red triangular block (vertical orientation)\n- **Block 9**: Green rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 10**: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 11**: Red triangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 12**: Blue rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 13**: Red rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 14**: Red triangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 15**: Red rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- **Block 16**: Red triangular block (horizontal orientation)\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nBased on the selected blocks, the assembly sequence is as follows:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 5\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move"

    "instruction": "<|image_pad|><|image_pad|>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

    "predict": "### Main Target Image Analysis\n\nThe main target image shows a structure composed of the following blocks:\n- Two red rectangular blocks, one on top of the other.\n- One yellow rectangular block on top of the red blocks.\n- Two red cylindrical blocks, one on each side of the yellow block.\n- One red triangular block on top of the yellow block.\n\nThe structure has three layers:\n1. The bottom layer consists of two red cylindrical blocks.\n2. The middle layer consists of a yellow rectangular block.\n3. The top layer consists of a red triangular block on top of the yellow block.\n\nThe spatial relationships are as follows:\n- The red cylindrical blocks are directly below the yellow block.\n- The red triangular block is directly on top of the yellow block.\n\n### Block Dictionary Image Analysis\n\nThe block dictionary image contains the following sub-images:\n1. A yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n2. A red rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n3. A red rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n4. A yellow rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n5. A red cylindrical block in a vertical orientation.\n6. A red cylindrical block in a horizontal orientation.\n7. A red triangular block in a vertical orientation.\n8. A red triangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n\n### Required Blocks Selection\n\nBased on the analysis of the main target image, the required blocks from the dictionary are:\n- Block 1: Yellow rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n- Block 2: Red rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n- Block 3: Red rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n- Block 4: Red triangular block in a vertical orientation.\n- Block 5: Red cylindrical block in a vertical orientation.\n- Block 6: Red cylindrical block in a horizontal orientation.\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nTo construct the structure, follow these steps:\n1. Move block with index 1 (yellow rectangular block in a vertical orientation) to the bottom layer.\n2. Move block with index 2 (red rectangular block in a horizontal orientation) to the middle layer.\n3. Move block with index 3 (red rectangular block in a vertical orientation) to the middle layer.\n4. Move block with index 4 (red triangular block in a vertical orientation) to the top layer.\n5. Move block with index 5 (red cylindrical block in a vertical orientation) to the bottom layer.\n6. Move block with index 6 (red cylindrical block in a horizontal orientation) to the bottom layer.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"Step1\": \""

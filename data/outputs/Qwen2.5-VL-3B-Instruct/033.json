    "instruction": "<|image_pad|><|image_pad|>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

    "predict": "### Main Target Image Analysis\n\nThe main target image shows a structure composed of the following blocks:\n- Two red rectangular blocks stacked on top of each other.\n- One yellow rectangular block on top of the red blocks.\n- Two red cylindrical blocks on the bottom, forming a base.\n- One yellow rectangular block on top of the red cylindrical blocks.\n\nThe structure has three layers:\n1. The bottom layer consists of two red cylindrical blocks.\n2. The middle layer consists of one yellow rectangular block.\n3. The top layer consists of two red rectangular blocks stacked on top of each other, with a yellow rectangular block on top.\n\n### Block Dictionary Image Analysis\n\nThe block dictionary image contains the following sub-images:\n- Sub-image 1: Yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n- Sub-image 2: Yellow rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n- Sub-image 3: Red rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n- Sub-image 4: Red rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n- Sub-image 5: Red cylindrical block in a horizontal orientation.\n- Sub-image 6: Red cylindrical block in a vertical orientation.\n\n### Required Blocks Selection\n\nBased on the analysis of the main target image, the required blocks from the dictionary are:\n- Block Index 1: Yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n- Block Index 2: Yellow rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n- Block Index 5: Red cylindrical block in a horizontal orientation.\n- Block Index 6: Red cylindrical block in a vertical orientation.\n- Block Index 3: Red rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n- Block Index 4: Red rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nTo construct the structure as shown in the main target image, follow these steps:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 3\n   Step6: Move block with index 4\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 2\n   Step9: Move block with index 5\n   Step10: Move block with index 6\n   Step11: Move block with index 3\n   Step12: Move block with index 4\n}"

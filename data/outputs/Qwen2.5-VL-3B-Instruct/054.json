    "instruction": "<|image_pad|><|image_pad|>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

    "predict": "### Main Target Image Analysis\n\nThe main target image shows a structure composed of 16 building blocks arranged in a specific pattern. The structure has 4 layers, and the blocks are stacked in a way that each layer is slightly offset from the one below it. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Layer 1 (Top Layer):**\n   - 4 blocks: 1 yellow, 1 red, 1 blue, 1 green\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - 4 blocks: 1 yellow, 1 red, 1 blue, 1 green\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - 4 blocks: 1 yellow, 1 red, 1 blue, 1 green\n\n4. **Layer 4 (Bottom Layer):**\n   - 4 blocks: 1 yellow, 1 red, 1 blue, 1 green\n\n### Block Dictionary Image Analysis\n\nThe block dictionary image contains 16 sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation. Each sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner. Here is a summary of the block types and their orientations:\n\n- **Yellow Blocks:**\n  - 4 blocks in different orientations (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and rotated diagonal)\n\n- **Red Blocks:**\n  - 4 blocks in different orientations (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and rotated diagonal)\n\n- **Blue Blocks:**\n  - 4 blocks in different orientations (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and rotated diagonal)\n\n- **Green Blocks:**\n  - 4 blocks in different orientations (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and rotated diagonal)\n\n### Block Selection and Assembly Order\n\nBased on the analysis of the main target image, the required blocks and their indices are as follows:\n\n- **Yellow Blocks:**\n  - 1, 5, 13, 16\n\n- **Red Blocks:**\n  - 2, 6, 10, 14\n\n- **Blue Blocks:**\n  - 3, 7, 11, 15\n\n- **Green Blocks:**\n  - 4, 8, 9, 12\n\n### Assembly Instructions\n\n```json\n{\n   \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n   \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n   \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n   \"Step4\": \"Move block with index "

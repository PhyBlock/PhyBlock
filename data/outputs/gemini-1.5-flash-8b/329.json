The base layer consists of two orange, vertically oriented cylindrical blocks.  The second layer is built on top of the orange cylinders, with a rectangular block of a specific shade of yellow/orange,  with a curved arch shape (block #2) sitting atop one cylinder. On the other cylinder, there's a blue cube (block #3) atop a yellow/orange rectangular block (block #9).  The top layer consists of a blue cube (block #3) on top of the other yellow/orange rectangular block (block #9) and an additional arch shape block (block #2) in between the two cylinders. Finally, a light yellowish-orange block (block #9) in the shape of a rectangle in the horizontal position sits next to these blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:** Based on the target image and block dictionary, the following blocks are required:\n      * Block #2 (red arch) x 2\n      * Block #3 (blue cube) x 1\n      * Block #9 (yellow rectangular block) x 2\n      * Block #13 (orange cylinder) x 2\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 9\"\n}\n```"

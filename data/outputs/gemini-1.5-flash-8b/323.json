The blocks include a green cube, a blue cube, an orange triangular prism, a red block with a curved cutout, and another red block with a similar cutout.\n   - Structure 2 (right):  Composed of 5 blocks in 3 layers.  It has two orange rectangular blocks with a triangular part and a pair of yellow rectangular prisms used as columns.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure 1:**\n     - Block 1: Red block with a curved cutout\n     - Block 6: Green cube\n     - Block 7: Blue cube\n     - Block 13: Orange triangular prism\n     - Block 2: Red block with a curved cutout (same as 1)\n   * **Structure 2:**\n     - Block 11: Orange rectangular block with triangular top\n     - Block 10: Yellow rectangular block\n     - Block 11: Orange rectangular block with triangular top (same as 11)\n     - Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (same as 10)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 6 on top of block 1\nStep4: Move block with index 7 on top of block 6\nStep5: Move block with index 13 on top of block 7\nStep6: Move block with index 11\nStep7: Move block with index 10 on top of block 11\nStep8: Move block with index 11 on top of block 10\nStep9: Move block with index 10 on top of block 11\nStep10: Move block with index 13 on the other side of index 11 and 10 in structure 2.\n\n}\n```"

There might be more hidden by the visible blocks.\n   - **Layers:** The structure appears to have at least three layers. The base is one layer, the middle layer contains the two connected yellow blocks and blue block structure, and then the top layer has the orange triangular blocks.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:**  The orange cylindrical blocks form the base support. The yellow rectangular blocks are on top of them, intersecting to form a cross-like structure. The blue cube is on top of the yellow rectangular blocks. The orange triangular blocks are on top of other blocks to create roof-like structures.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   - **Needed Blocks:** Based on the colors and shapes, the following blocks are needed:\n      - Block 1 (Blue Cube)\n      - Block 4 (Yellow Rectangular)\n      - Block 5 (Yellow Rectangular)\n      - Block 7 (Orange Vertical Rectangular)\n      - Block 8 (Orange Cylinder)\n      - Block 13 (Orange Triangular)\n      - Block 14 (Orange Triangular)\n\n   - **Block Indices:**  [1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14]\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 8\nStep2: Move block with index 8\nStep3: Move block with index 7\nStep4: Move block with index 7\nStep5: Move block with index 5\nStep6: Move block with index 5\nStep7: Move block with index 4\nStep8: Move block with index 1\nStep9: Move block with index 13\nStep10: Move block with index 14\n```\n"

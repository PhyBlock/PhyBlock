Two orange blocks (likely #1) are placed on top, creating pillars. On top of these, a triangular red block (#14), a square blue block (#7), and a small triangular red block (#14) are placed.\n\n\n   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n   - Block Count: 7\n   - Layers: 3\n   - Spatial Relationships: A yellow rectangular block (#9) forms the base. Two red curved blocks (#2) sit on top of the base, creating a archway. A red block (#6) is placed above these, a yellow block (#9) on top of that. A second red triangular block (#14) sits on top of the yellow block. A red block with a curved top (#2) is sitting on top of that.\n\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1:**\n\n   - Block Index 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n   - Block Index 1 (orange rectangular block)\n   - Block Index 14 (red triangle)\n   - Block Index 7 (blue square block)\n\n\n   **Structure 2:**\n   - Block Index 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n   - Block Index 2 (red curved block)\n   - Block Index 2 (red curved block)\n   - Block Index 6 (red square block)\n   - Block Index 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n   - Block Index 14 (red triangle)\n   - Block Index 2 (red curved block)\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   **Structure 1:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\n   **Structure 2:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

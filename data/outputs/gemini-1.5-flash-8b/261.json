There are two distinct structures.\n\n\n   **Structure 1 (Tree-like):**\n   * **Block Count:** Approximately 5\n   * **Layers:** 3\n   * **Spatial Relationships:** A tall, reddish-orange, vertical block is supported by a green rectangular block. A green triangular block sits atop the vertical block. The base is a yellow/tan block, above a green rectangular block.\n\n\n   **Structure 2 (Building):**\n   * **Block Count:** Approximately 7\n   * **Layers:** 3\n   * **Spatial Relationships:**  A red arched block sits at the base of a blue square block.  A yellow/tan block is on the red arch block, with a green block on top. Several other blocks surround and support these in a building-like arrangement.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1:**\n   * Block 9 (Green Rectangular)\n   * Block 13 (Reddish-orange Vertical)\n   * Block 16 (Triangular Reddish-Orange)\n   * Block 6 (Yellow/tan rectangular)\n\n   **Structure 2:**\n   * Block 1 (Red Arch)\n   * Block 4 (Blue Square)\n   * Block 14 (Yellow/Tan Arch)\n   * Block 7 (Green Rectangular)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9 (Green Rectangular) to build the base for the Tree Structure\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13 (Reddish-orange Vertical) on top of the green base of the tree structure\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6 (Yellow/tan rectangular) on the bottom of the tree structure\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 16 (Triangular Reddish-Orange) on the top of the reddish-orange vertical block in the tree structure\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1 (Red Arch) to form the base of the building structure\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4 (Blue Square) on top of the Red arch\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14 (Yellow/Tan Arch) on the top of the red arch\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 7 (Green Rectangular) on top of the yellow Arch\"\n\n}\n```"

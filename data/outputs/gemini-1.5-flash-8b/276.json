There are 3 layers. The blocks have different colors (green, blue, yellow, orange/red).  The blocks are arranged vertically and horizontally, with the colors and shapes forming a distinct pattern.\n\n\n   **Structure 2 (Arch):**  Consists of 4 blocks.  There are 2 layers. The blocks are red, with one having a cutout or hole in the middle. Two blue blocks are positioned within the arch formed by the red blocks.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1 (Tower):**\n      - Block 9 (green cube)\n      - Block 10 (blue cube)\n      - Block 11 (yellow rectangular prism)\n      - Block 13 (red rectangular prism)\n      - Block 14 (orange/red triangular prism)\n      - Block 13 (red rectangular prism â€“ used twice)\n\n\n   **Structure 2 (Arch):**\n      - Block 1 (red arch segment)\n      - Block 2 (red arch segment)\n      - Block 1 (red arch segment)\n      - Block 2 (red arch segment)\n      - Block 10 (blue cube)\n      - Block 10 (blue cube)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1 (Tower)\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step 2: Move block with index 11 on top of block 13\",\n    \"Step 3: Move block with index 9 on top of block 11\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 10 on top of block 9\",\n    \"Step 5: Move block with index 13 on top of block 10\",\n\t\t\"Step 6: Move block with index 14 on top of block 13\",\n\t\t\"Step 7: Move block with index 13 on top of block 14 (above the previously placed block 13)\"\n  ],\n  \"Structure 2 (Arch)\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step 2: Move block with index 2 next to block 1\",\n    \"Step 3: Move block with index 1 on top of block 2\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 2 next to block 1 (above previous)\",\n\t\t\"Step 5: Move block with index 10 onto the space in the middle\",\n\t\t\"Step 6: Move block with index 10 onto the space beside the first block 10\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n"

The taller tower has 5 layers, and the smaller tower has 3 layers.  The blocks are arranged in a variety of ways: some are stacked vertically, some are placed side-by-side horizontally, and some are placed in a curved manner.  The colors and shapes of the blocks vary.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the visual inspection of the main image and block dictionary, the following block indices are required:\n\n\n*   **Block 1 (Red Arch):**  Used multiple times in the structure.\n*   **Block 4 (Green Rectangular):**  Used multiple times in the structure\n*   **Block 6 (Yellow Rectangular):** Used multiple times in the structure.\n*   **Block 9 (Orange Cylinder):** Used once in the structure.\n*   **Block 13 (Orange Triangle):** Used once in the structure.\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The provided assembly order is a *possible* interpretation.  A precise, complete assembly order depends on a detailed, higher resolution image to precisely determine the exact block rotations and relative positions in the structure.  The provided image lacks sufficient detail for a definitive ordering of every block position in the structure.  Some block placements may be ambiguous from the provided images.\n"

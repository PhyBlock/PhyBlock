The truck is composed of 7 blocks, while the castle/tower is composed of 6 blocks.  The structures have multiple layers, and the blocks are arranged according to their size and shape to form the overall shape of the truck and castle.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Truck Blocks:**\n   - Block Index 9 (yellow cylinder) x 2\n   - Block Index 6 (green rectangle)\n   - Block Index 14 (yellow rectangle)\n   - Block Index 4 (blue square)\n   - Block Index 3 (red curved block) x 2\n   - Block Index 1 (red curved block)\n\n   **Castle Blocks:**\n   - Block Index 10 (orange cylinder) x 2\n   - Block Index 5 (red square)\n   - Block Index 4 (blue square)\n   - Block Index 6 (green rectangle)\n   - Block Index 14 (yellow rectangle)\n   - Block Index 13 (yellow triangular block)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 9\nStep2: Move block with index 9\nStep3: Move block with index 6\nStep4: Move block with index 14\nStep5: Move block with index 4\nStep6: Move block with index 3\nStep7: Move block with index 3\nStep8: Move block with index 1\nStep9: Move block with index 10\nStep10: Move block with index 10\nStep11: Move block with index 5\nStep12: Move block with index 4\nStep13: Move block with index 6\nStep14: Move block with index 14\nStep15: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:** The assembly order is *crucial* for building these structures correctly.  The provided steps are a general guideline; actual block positioning will be determined by their spatial relationships in the images.  If the dictionary blocks weren't labeled, precise positional instructions would be impossible to provide."

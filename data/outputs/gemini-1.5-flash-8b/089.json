It consists of 9 blocks: 4 orange cylindrical blocks, 2 yellow rectangular blocks, and 3 yellow curved blocks. The structure has 3 layers.\n\nThe spatial relationships are as follows:\n- The 4 orange cylinders form the legs of the giraffe, positioned at the base and supporting the rest of the structure.\n- Two yellow rectangles are placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinders, forming the giraffe's body.\n- A yellow semi-circular block is placed on top of the yellow rectangle, forming a head.\n- The remaining two yellow rectangular blocks sit horizontally on the second layer of orange cylinders, and the curved yellow block is sitting on top of these.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the target image and the block dictionary:\n\n**Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n\n* Orange Cylinder: Block Index 7 (4 times)\n* Yellow Rectangle: Block Index 2 (2 times)\n* Yellow Semi-Circle: Block Index 9\n* Yellow Rectangle: Block Index 13 (2 times)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n}\n```\n**Important Note**:  The exact placement order of steps 1-4 (and steps 7-8) is implicit in the 3D arrangement, but can't be definitively listed in a rigid sequence without a 3D visualization tool to track layering/relative positions.  The above order is an attempt to follow the logical construction, but without the 3D capabilities, precise order might vary slightly."

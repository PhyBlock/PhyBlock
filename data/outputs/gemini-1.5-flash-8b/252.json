            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image shows a structure composed of various blocks.  There are two main sections: a tower and a small building-like structure.  The tower consists of a series of vertically oriented rectangular blocks, the overall structure comprising 5 layers. The small building has three levels.\n\nThe blocks are arranged in a layered, stacked manner.  Spatial relationships include:\n* The tower is to the left of the building.\n* The blocks of the small building rest atop the orange support blocks.\n* Several blocks are stacked vertically.\n* Some blocks are positioned horizontally.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** The blocks required match the shapes, colors, and orientations from the block dictionary.\n* **List of Block Indices:**\n    * Block 10 (Orange Cylindrical Block): x 1\n    * Block 9 (Yellow Rectangular Block): x 4\n    * Block 11 (Orange Rectangular Block): x 4\n    * Block 6 (Green Rectangular Block): x 1\n    * Block 7 (Yellow Rectangular Block): x 1\n    * Block 4 (Orange Rectangular Block): x 1\n    * Block 14 (Yellow Rectangular Block): x 1\n    * Block 1 (Orange Arch Block): x 2\n    * Block 3 (Blue Rectangular Block): x 1\n    * Block 8 (Orange Rectangular Block): x 1\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10\nStep2: Move block with index 9\nStep3: Move block with index 11  on top of step 2\nStep4: Move block with index 11 on top of step 3\nStep5: Move block with index 11 on top of step 4\nStep6: Move block with index 9 on top of step 5\nStep7: Move block with index 11 on top of step 6\nStep8: Move block with index 6 on the right side of step 7\nStep9: Move block with index 7 on top of step 8\nStep10: Move block with index 1 (to the left)\nStep11: Move block with index 11 (to the right)\nStep12: Move block with index 3 on top of step 11\nStep13: Move block with index 8 to the right of step 10\nStep14: Move block with index 14 on top of step 13\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact order, especially for the overlapping or side-by-side blocks, can be slightly different depending on how you visually interpret the assembly from a 2D perspective.  This solution provides a reasonable interpretation based on the apparent relative positions of the blocks.  A 3D model and/or additional perspective information would be extremely helpful to generate precise steps.\n"

It has two layers.\n   * **Structure 2 (Tower):** This structure is a tower-like stack. It's composed of 7 blocks and has 3 layers. The blocks are arranged in a specific way.  The spatial relationships are crucial for the assembly order.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (House):**\n      * Block Index 13 (red triangle)\n      * Block Index 14 (orange triangle)\n      * Block Index 7 (green rectangular)\n      * Block Index 5 (red rectangular)\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Tower):**\n      * Block Index 3 (blue cube)\n      * Block Index 6 (yellow rectangular)\n      * Block Index 4 (green slanted rectangular)\n      * Block Index 2 (red arched)\n      * Block Index 9 (yellow rectangular)\n      * Block Index 10 (yellow rectangular)\n      * Block Index 11 (yellow rectangular)\n\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 4\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n    Step10: Move block with index 7\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:** The order for Structure 1 (House) is essential to ensure the correct arrangement of the layers.  The instructions presented assume the blocks are placed on a flat surface to create the shapes.   Missing visual clues, such as precise position information in the dictionary images, make certain parts of the arrangement less definitive and depend on logical placement.\n"

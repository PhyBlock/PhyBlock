The structure on the left comprises 5 blocks: 2 orange rectangular, 1 green rectangular, 1 orange cylindrical, and 1 orange triangular. These blocks are in 2 layers.  The structure on the right is a tower made of 5 blocks: 1 red, 1 blue, 1 green, 1 orange, and 1 yellow rectangular blocks. It is a 4-layer structure. The blocks in each structure are arranged in a way that some are placed above and adjacent to other blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure on Left:**\n\n   * Block Index 3: Orange Rectangular\n   * Block Index 2: Green Rectangular\n   * Block Index 10: Orange Cylindrical\n   * Block Index 13: Orange Triangular\n\n   **Structure on Right:**\n\n   * Block Index 4: Red Rectangular\n   * Block Index 1: Blue Rectangular\n   * Block Index 2: Green Rectangular\n   * Block Index 3: Orange Rectangular\n   * Block Index 5: Yellow Rectangular\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10\nStep2: Move block with index 13\nStep3: Move block with index 3 adjacent to block with index 10, with 3  under 10\nStep4: Move block with index 2  on top of block with index 3 (and 10)\nStep5: Move block with index 2 (next green rect) adjacent to block with index 3.\nStep6: Move block with index 4\nStep7: Move block with index 1 on top of block with index 4\nStep8: Move block with index 2 on top of block with index 1.\nStep9: Move block with index 3 on top of block with index 2\nStep10: Move block with index 5 on top of block with index 3.\n}\n```"

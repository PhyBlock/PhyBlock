            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main image shows a structure composed of various rectangular, cylindrical, and triangular prism blocks. There are 7 distinct blocks.  The structure appears to have 3 layers.  The blocks are arranged in a vertical tower-like structure and a separate horizontal bench-like structure.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The tower structure is composed of blocks stacked vertically.\n    * Blocks 1, 6, and 3 (in this order) form the central column on top of each other.\n    * Blocks 1, 6, and 3 are flanked by two blocks 1, symmetrically placed.\n    * A rectangular block (block 4) is positioned horizontally at the base of the tower.\n    * A separate, smaller structure, composed of block 9, 7, and 4, sits to the right.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n| Block in Target Image   | Block Index from Dictionary |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Orange Triangular Block | 13                         |\n| Orange Triangular Block | 14                         |\n| Orange Cylindrical Block | 9                          |\n| Orange Cylindrical Block | 10                         |\n| Yellow Rectangular Block | 4                          |\n| Green Rectangular Block  | 1                          |\n| Yellow Rectangular Block | 5                          |\n| Green Rectangular Block  | 6                          |\n| Green Rectangular Block | 2                          |\n| Orange Triangular Block | 14                         |\n| Yellow Rectangular Block | 7                          |\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep 1: Move block with index 1\nStep 2: Move block with index 6 on top of block with index 1\nStep 3: Move block with index 2 on top of block with index 6\nStep 4: Move block with index 13 on top of block with index 2\nStep 5: Move block with index 14 on top of block with index 13\nStep 6: Move block with index 3 next to block with index 1 and to the left side.\nStep 7: Move block with index 4 on the bottom of block 1,6,and 2 column\nStep 8: Move block with index 9 on the left side of 4, and underneath.\nStep 9: Move block with index 7 to the right side of block 9, in front.\nStep 10: Move block with index 10 on top of 7, on top of block with index 7.\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The provided images are not fully clear on the exact placement in step-by-step instructions, so additional information would need to be provided. This answer attempts to infer based on visible connections."

            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main image shows two structures.  The structure on the left is a small tower-like shape composed of 4 orange triangular prisms (or pyramids), with one blue block at the center of the base.  There are 3 layers.  The structure on the right is a gate-like structure consisting of 2 orange cylindrical blocks and one yellow rectangular block.  The yellow block sits horizontally on top of the two vertical orange cylinders.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure on the Left:**\n    * Block 9 (orange triangular prism) - 3x\n    * Block 1 (blue rectangular prism) - 1x\n    * Block 13 (orange triangular prism - different orientation) - 1x\n\n* **Structure on the Right:**\n    * Block 6 (orange cylindrical prism) - 2x\n    * Block 3 (yellow rectangular prism) - 1x\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure on the Left\": [\n    {\n      \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9 (on top of the first 9)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9 (on top of the second 9)\"\n    },\n\t\t{\n      \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13 (on top of the last 9)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"Structure on the Right\": [\n    {\n      \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6 (next to the first 6)\"\n    },\n\t\t{\n      \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3 (on top of the 2 6's)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The assembly order is crucial and must be followed to construct the structures.   The above instructions focus on moving the required blocks to the desired locations in the order they are presented in the images. More specific instructions would need the precise relative placement of the blocks in the target image to make a highly detailed assembly instructions. The method presented here is the most straightforward approach to accomplish the task, given the available visual information."

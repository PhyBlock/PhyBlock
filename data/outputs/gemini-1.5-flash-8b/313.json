Let's analyze the structure on the left (the \"giraffe\").\n\n   - **Block Count:**  There are 7 blocks.\n   - **Layers:** The structure has 3 layers.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:** The structure has 4 tall, orange cylindrical blocks as the base.  A yellow rectangular block sits on top of each orange cylinder.  A taller green rectangular block is placed on top of the yellow blocks. A top curved block (yellow) sits on top of the green block.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   - **Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, the following blocks from the dictionary are required to reproduce the left structure:\n\n   - **Block Indices:**  11 (orange cylinder), 9 (yellow rectangle), 6 (green rectangle), 13 (yellow curved top).\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 11\n      Step2: Move block with index 9 on top of block 11\n      Step3: Move block with index 11\n      Step4: Move block with index 9 on top of block 11\n      Step5: Move block with index 11\n      Step6: Move block with index 9 on top of block 11\n      Step7: Move block with index 11\n      Step8: Move block with index 9 on top of block 11\n      Step9: Move block with index 6 on top of the 4 yellow blocks\n      Step10: Move block with index 13 on top of block 6\n\n   }\n\n\n**Important Note:** The second structure (the \"dinosaur\") is also present in the image.   To construct the dinosaur, you will need to reference the block dictionary and follow a similar process for block selection and assembly order.  I have only provided instructions for the \"giraffe\" structure.\n"

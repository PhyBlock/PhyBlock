            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n   The main image shows a structure composed of blocks in two colors:  green and orange-red.  There are 6 distinct blocks visible (a total of 9 blocks are part of the structure if one counts each of the three vertical green columns as individual blocks).  There are 3 layers in the structure on the right.  The blocks are arranged in a somewhat asymmetrical, stepped layout.  Spatial relationships include blocks stacked vertically (columns) and positioned next to one another horizontally.  The structure on the right appears to be a small fortress or similar construction.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:**  Blocks 1, 6, 7, 10, 13, and 4 appear to be required.\n   * **List of Block Indices:** 1, 6, 7, 10, 13, 4\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\"  \n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Assembly Order Reasoning:**\n\nThe order starts with the base elements.  Block 6 is placed at the bottom to form the base.  Then blocks 10 and 13 are positioned adjacent to block 6 (for supporting the structure and positioning correctly). The vertical blocks (6 and 7) are positioned next to each other to add vertical support. The horizontal blocks are positioned on top of these base blocks for the top layers.  Finally, block 1 is positioned on top of block 7 and block 4 is positioned next to block 1.  \n\n\n**Important Note:**  There are multiple possible valid assembly orders depending on how the structure is analyzed in detail."

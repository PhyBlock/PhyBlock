            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main image shows two structures built from various colored blocks.  \n- Structure 1 (triangle): appears to be 4 layers high and uses 7 different blocks.\n- Structure 2 (tower/bridge):  appears to be 4 layers high and uses 6 different blocks.\n\nThe structures have different block shapes and sizes.  The blocks are arranged in a variety of configurations, including some that are stacked and some that are placed adjacent.  It is important to note the exact orientation (e.g., horizontal, vertical) of each block in the target structure for accurate selection.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Structure 1 (triangle):**\n- Block Index 13 (orange triangular): 1\n- Block Index 5 (green square): 1\n- Block Index 3 (blue square): 1\n- Block Index 1 (red arch): 1\n- Block Index 13 (orange triangular): 1\n- Block Index 14 (orange triangular): 1\n- Block Index 15 (orange triangular): 1\n- Block Index 14 (orange triangular): 1\n- Block Index 4 (blue square): 1\n- Block Index 2 (red arch): 1\n\n\n**Structure 2 (tower/bridge):**\n- Block Index 8 (yellow vertical): 1\n- Block Index 5 (green square): 1\n- Block Index 9 (green vertical): 1\n- Block Index 6 (red square): 1\n- Block Index 14 (orange triangular): 1\n- Block Index 15 (orange triangular): 1\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 2 \n\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 5\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n    Step14: Move block with index 6\n    Step15: Move block with index 14\n    Step16: Move block with index 15\n}\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact assembly order for the structures is visually inferred from the image. The provided template was used to illustrate the concept of step-by-step instructions.  A more complete and precise assembly sequence would require a clearer, more detailed visual layout showing the exact stacking order.  For real-world applications, digital modeling software or detailed 3D renderings are vital to create precise assembly directions.\n"

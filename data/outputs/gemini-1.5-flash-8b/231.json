More may be hidden by others.\n   - **Layers:** The structure has multiple layers, with blocks stacked vertically in a few areas.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:**  Blocks are arranged in various configurations.  Some are adjacent, some are stacked above others, some are positioned side-by-side.  A noticeable \"tunnel\" or \"passage\" is formed by some of the blocks. Triangular blocks are visible in multiple places forming parts of the structure.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   - **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on shape, color, and orientation, the following blocks from the dictionary are required:\n      - **Block Index 1:** Red curved block\n      - **Block Index 2:** Red curved block\n      - **Block Index 3:** Red curved block\n      - **Block Index 4:** Blue cube block\n      - **Block Index 5:** Green cube block\n      - **Block Index 6:** Yellow cube block\n      - **Block Index 9:** Green slab block\n      - **Block Index 14:** Orange rectangular block\n      - **Block Index 15:** Orange triangular block\n   - **List Block Indices:**  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 14, 15]\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 15\n      Step2: Move block with index 14\n      Step3: Move block with index 15, atop block 14.\n      Step4: Move block with index 1.\n      Step5: Move block with index 2, adjacent to block 1.\n      Step6: Move block with index 3, adjacent to block 2.\n      Step7: Move block with index 4, atop block 3.\n      Step8: Move block with index 9, positioned in the lower level.\n      Step9: Move block with index 6, alongside block 9.\n      Step10: Move block with index 5, atop block 9 and 6.\n      Step11: Move block with index 6, alongside block 5. (This likely repeats some blocks).\n      Step12: Move block with index 14, adjacent to 9\n      Step13: Move block with index 15, alongside of block 14.\n\n   }\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hidden Blocks:**  The provided images don't show the complete structure, so the required block count and exact arrangement are estimations.\n* **Ambiguity:**  There may be some ambiguity in the order; there could be multiple valid ways to assemble the structure (e.g., if blocks can be flipped slightly).\n"

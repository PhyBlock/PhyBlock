The bottom layer is composed of two blocks: a yellow rectangular block (laying horizontally), and a red block with a circular cutout on top of the yellow block. The top layer is also composed of two blocks: a yellow rectangular block (laying horizontally) and a red block with a circular cutout positioned on top of the bottom red block with the circular cutout.  The yellow blocks are positioned horizontally and are adjacent to each other and also adjacent to the red blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Two red blocks with a circular cutout, two yellow rectangular blocks.\n* **List of Block Indices:**\n    * 2 (red block with circular cutout)\n    * 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n    * 2 (red block with circular cutout)\n    * 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 9\nStep2: Move block with index 2 on top of block with index 9\nStep3: Move block with index 9 on top of the block with index 2\nStep4: Move block with index 2 on top of the block with index 9\n```\n"

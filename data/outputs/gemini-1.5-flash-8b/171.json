            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n   The main image shows a structure composed of various rectangular, cylindrical, and triangular building blocks.  There are at least 10 blocks visible; the exact count is difficult to determine from the angle. The structure has multiple layers.  Blocks are arranged in different orientations, both vertically and horizontally. The spatial relationships are as follows:\n\n   - Some blocks are stacked vertically on top of others.\n   - Some blocks are placed adjacent to one another.\n   - There are at least two different widths of rectangular blocks used.\n   - A small triangular block is atop a wider yellow rectangular block, which is then supported by a double-layered yellow cylindrical block.\n   - A larger central structure is built with different colored blocks, including a red arched block sitting on top of a yellow rectangular block.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   Based on the visual analysis, here are the likely blocks needed, along with their indices (from the dictionary):\n\n   - Block 9 (yellow rectangular block) - likely multiple instances\n   - Block 1 (red rectangular block) - likely multiple instances\n   - Block 7 (green rectangular block) - likely multiple instances\n   - Block 10 (tall yellow rectangular block)\n   - Block 14 (yellow rectangular block)\n   - Block 15 (orange triangular block)\n   - Block 16 (orange triangular block)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9 (above Step 4)\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9 (adjacent to the red block)\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7 (adjacent to the other)\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 9 (on top of the 10)\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n   \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 9 (adjacent to the previous 9's)\",\n  \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  Without a precise image of the block dictionary, exact indices for every block, and precise block counts, it's impossible to provide an entirely accurate and step-by-step assembly instruction. Some blocks are very similar in the target image, so a precise match is not always possible. The provided answer is an educated guess based on the information given.   More clarity in the block dictionary image, possibly via explicit block count or labels would improve accuracy."

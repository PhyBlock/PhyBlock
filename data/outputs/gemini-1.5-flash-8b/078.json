There are a total of 10 blocks used.  There are 3 layers.  The blocks are arranged in a specific order with some blocks supporting others above them.  Various shapes and colors are used.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n\n   * Block 1 (Red curved block) - x2\n   * Block 4 (Red angled block) - x1\n   * Block 6 (Blue cube) - x1\n   * Block 7 (Green cube) - x1\n   * Block 9 (Yellow block) - x1\n   * Block 10 (Orange angled block) - x2\n   * Block 11 (Orange angled block)-x1\n   * Block 12 (Red block) - x1\n   * Block 14 (Orange angled block)-x1\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9 (Yellow block)\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1 (Red curved block) on top of block 9\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1 (Red curved block) to the right side of block 1 from step 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 12 (Red block) on top of block 1\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10 (Orange angled block) to the right side of block 1 from step 2\",\n   \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14 (Orange angled block) to the right of block 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10 (Orange angled block) on top of block 4\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 4 (Red angled block) on top of the block from step 7\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 6 (Blue cube) on top of block 4\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7 (Green cube) to the right side of block 6\",\n   \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 11 (Orange angled block) in front of the structure\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 1 (Red curved block) on the block 11\",\n   \n\n}\n```\n**Note:** This assembly order is a possible solution. There might be alternative valid sequences, especially for the more complex spatial relationships.  The exact order of placing blocks in the second and third layer might depend on how the structure is being viewed."

There are three distinct sections.  \n   - **Left Section:** Two red curved blocks, a blue cube block placed on top of them.  These form a 3 block, 2 layer section.\n   - **Right Section:** Two yellow cylindrical blocks, upon which a red triangular block, then a red arched/curved block, then a red triangular block are stacked to form a small structure resembling a building with a roof.   This is a 3 layer section and a 4 block section.\n   - **Total:** There are a total of 9 blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n\n   * **Left Section:**\n      * Block 3 (red curved block)\n      * Block 3 (red curved block)\n      * Block 6 (blue cube block)\n   * **Right Section:**\n      * Block 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n      * Block 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n      * Block 14 (red triangular block)\n      * Block 2 (red curved block)\n      * Block 14 (red triangular block)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 3\nStep2: Move block with index 3\nStep3: Move block with index 6\nStep4: Move block with index 9\nStep5: Move block with index 9\nStep6: Move block with index 14\nStep7: Move block with index 2\nStep8: Move block with index 14\n```\n"

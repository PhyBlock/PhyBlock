The blocks are arranged in a way that creates a bridge-like formation with a small tower on the right.\n\n\nThe spatial relationships are:\n- Two red arched blocks (Block 1/Block 3) are placed side-by-side, forming the base.\n- A yellow rectangular block (Block 9) sits on top of the red arched blocks.\n- A green rectangular block (Block 5), a blue rectangular block (Block 6), and another green rectangular block are stacked on top of the yellow block, forming the structure's middle layer.\n- An orange triangular block (Block 14), a blue rectangular block, and a green rectangular block (Block 5) are stacked vertically on the right side, forming the tower.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**  Based on the target image, the following blocks are required:\n\n    * Block 1 (Red Arch)\n    * Block 3 (Red Arch)\n    * Block 9 (Yellow Rectangle)\n    * Block 5 (Green Rectangle)\n    * Block 6 (Blue Rectangle)\n    * Block 14 (Orange Triangular)\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 3, 9, 5, 6, 14\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 14 \n    Step7: Move block with index 5 above index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 5 above index 6 and 14\n\n}"

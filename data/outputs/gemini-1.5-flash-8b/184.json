Some blocks may be hidden from view.\n   - **Layers:**  There are at least 3 layers to the structure.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:**\n     - A cylinder (likely block #9) is at the core, supported by the structure.\n     - On top of the cylinder, there are two curved blocks (likely #1, #2, or #3).\n     - A small cube (likely #5 or #6) and a slightly angled block (likely #14 or #15) are below the top blocks.\n     - Further down, a yellow cube (likely #7), a blue cube (likely #5), and a small angled block are placed.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   - **Needed Blocks:** Based on the target image, the following blocks are required:\n      - Block Index 1 (red curved block) (x2)\n      - Block Index 5 (blue cube)\n      - Block Index 7 (yellow cube)\n      - Block Index 9 (orange cylinder)\n      - Block Index 14 (red-orange angled block)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n\n}\n```\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hidden Blocks:** The exact configuration of the structure and placement of additional blocks within the layers is not definitively known from the images. The above is based on visible blocks only.\n* **Block # Order:** There may be other valid sequences of assembly, although the most apparent order is described above.  The specific indices for blocks 1 and 14 in the dictionary need confirmation of the exact color and orientation, but the visual cues should be sufficient.\n"

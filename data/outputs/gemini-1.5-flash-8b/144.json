There are three layers in the taller tower and two in the shorter tower. The blocks are arranged in a way that create two separate vertical structures.  A reddish-brown block with an arched opening acts as a base connecting the towers.  The blocks show clear spatial relationships:  specific blocks are stacked vertically; others are positioned horizontally adjacent to each other.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n\n* **Tower 1 (taller):**\n    * Layer 1: Block 6 (Blue Square)\n    * Layer 2: Block 9 (Red Square)\n    * Layer 3: Block 14 (Orange Triangular Roof)\n* **Tower 2 (shorter):**\n    * Layer 1: Block 14 (Orange Triangular Roof)\n    * Layer 2: Block 7 (Green Rectangular Block)\n* **Base:**\n    * Block 2 (Red Arch)\n* **Supporting Base Structure:**\n    * Block 1 (Red Half-Arc)\n    * Block 3 (Red Half-Arc)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 2 (Red Arch)\nStep2: Move block with index 1 (Red Half-Arc) on top of index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 3 (Red Half-Arc) to the other side of index 2, placed above index 1\nStep4: Move block with index 6 (Blue Square) on top of index 1\nStep5: Move block with index 9 (Red Square) on top of index 6\nStep6: Move block with index 14 (Orange Roof) on top of index 9\nStep7: Move block with index 7 (Green Rectangular Block) on the arch\nStep8: Move block with index 14 (Orange Roof) next to index 6, on top of 7.\n```"

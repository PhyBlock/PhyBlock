The blocks are arranged in a vertically stacked configuration. A yellow block is placed horizontally in the middle layer, and a red arched block and a red, roof-shaped block are positioned to form the top layer. \n\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Green/Orange):** Composed of 4 blocks. The structure has 3 layers. The blocks are stacked vertically, with a green rectangular block forming the base, and orange triangular blocks are placed on top in the appropriate orientation.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (Red):**\n      * Block Index 1 (Red arch)\n      * Block Index 2 (Red arch)\n      * Block Index 9 (Yellow horizontal block)\n      * Block Index 1 (Red arch)\n      * Block Index 13 (Orange roof shape)\n\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Green/Orange):**\n      * Block Index 7 (Green rectangular block)\n      * Block Index 15 (Orange triangle)\n      * Block Index 15 (Orange triangle)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (Red):**\n\n     ```json\n     {\n        Step1: Move block with index 2\n        Step2: Move block with index 1\n        Step3: Move block with index 9\n        Step4: Move block with index 13\n        Step5: Move block with index 1\n     }\n     ```\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Green/Orange):**\n\n     ```json\n     {\n        Step1: Move block with index 7\n        Step2: Move block with index 15\n        Step3: Move block with index 15\n     }\n     ```\n"

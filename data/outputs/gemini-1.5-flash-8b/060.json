The base is composed of two red blocks (with curved sections) arranged side-by-side, which rest on the base plane.  A red block with a curved section sits on top of each of these base blocks, and then two yellow blocks rest horizontally atop the curved-sectioned blocks. Finally, a single curved-sectioned red block is placed on top of the yellow blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Based on the target image, the required blocks are:\n    * Block 2 (red, curved section) - x2\n    * Block 1 (red, curved section) - x2\n    * Block 9 (yellow, rectangular) - x2\n    * Block 13 (yellow, rectangular) -x1\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:**  [2, 1, 9, 9, 13]\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 1\nStep4: Move block with index 9\nStep5: Move block with index 9\nStep6: Move block with index 2\nStep7: Move block with index 13\n}"

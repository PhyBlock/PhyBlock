The second structure (right) consists of 5 blocks in 2 layers.   Spatial relationships: The left structure has a tall, orange/red column with a yellow block above and below, and a red/orange angled block on each side.  The right structure has a red curved block base, with a series of rectangular blocks stacked on it, including green, yellow and a blue block.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n   * Block 13: Orange/Red Triangle\n   * Block 9: Green Rectangle\n   * Block 10: Yellow Rectangle\n   * Block 11: Orange/Red Cylinder\n   * Block 13: Orange/Red Triangle\n   * Block 10: Yellow Rectangle\n\n   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n   * Block 1: Red Curved Block\n   * Block 5: Yellow Rectangle\n   * Block 6: Green Rectangle\n   * Block 4: Blue Square\n   * Block 1: Red Curved Block\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1 (Left)\": [\n    {\n      \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10, above block 11\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13, to the left of block 11\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13, to the right of block 11\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9, below block 10\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10, on top of block 9\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"Structure 2 (Right)\": [\n    {\n      \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5, above block 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6, above block 5\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4, between blocks 5 and 6\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1, above block 6\"\n    }\n\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The assembly order is *highly* dependent on the exact interpretation of how the blocks align and stack.  Small changes in the image (e.g., slight differences in the 3D modeling), could result in a different order.  Human judgement and visual interpretation play a significant role in such reconstruction."

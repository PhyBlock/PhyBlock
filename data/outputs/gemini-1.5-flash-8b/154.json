The structure on the left consists of red blocks, forming a small arch-like structure and a small tower. The structure on the right is a tall, central vertical post with a square-ish, multi-layered platform built on top of it. There are several horizontal blocks forming the layers of the upper part of this structure.  There are a total of at least 12 blocks visible; the precise count depends on what is behind other blocks in the structures.  The structures have multiple layers.  The spatial relationships are defined by the relative positions and arrangements of the blocks in each structure.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n| Structure Element | Block Index |\n|---|---|\n| Left Structure - Base Block (2 red curved blocks) | 1 |\n| Left Structure - Curved Block (2 red curved blocks) | 2 |\n| Left Structure - Red Block (2) | 13 |\n| Left Structure - Small red Triangle | 14 |\n| Right Structure - Vertical Post | 11 |\n| Right Structure - Horizontal Green Block (2) | 7|\n| Right Structure - Horizontal Yellow Block | 10 |\n| Right Structure -  Horizontal Red Block (2) | 13|\n| Right Structure - Square Block | 6 |\n| Right Structure - Blue Block | 6 |\n| Right Structure - Red Triangle | 15 |\n| Right Structure - Green Block | 9|\n| Right Structure - Orange/Red Triangle  | 14 |\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n\tStep1: Move block with index 11\n\tStep2: Move block with index 7\n\tStep3: Move block with index 10\n\tStep4: Move block with index 13\n\tStep5: Move block with index 13\n\tStep6: Move block with index 9\n\tStep7: Move block with index 6\n\tStep8: Move block with index 6\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n\tStep10: Move block with index 15\n\tStep11: Move block with index 2\n\tStep12: Move block with index 1\n\tStep13: Move block with index 14\n\tStep14: Move block with index 1\n\tStep15: Move block with index 13\n\tStep16: Move block with index 14\n\tStep17: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The assembly order is highly dependent on the exact details of hidden blocks and the nature of the visual representation of the structures. It's possible that other block indices may also be needed to make the two structures exactly as depicted in the image.\n\n\n"

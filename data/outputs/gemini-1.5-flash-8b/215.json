Let's analyze the structure on the left first.\n\n* **Count & Layers:**  The left structure appears to have 4 blocks.\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure on the left has 3 triangular blocks (one larger, two smaller) at the base, supporting a central block. The triangle blocks are placed at an angle. \n\n\nNow the structure on the right\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure on the right appears to have 7 blocks, with 2 blocks in the top layer, 3 in the middle layer, and 2 in the base layer.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  The arrangement is in a rocket/house shape with a hollow circular block.  The green block is above a blue and yellow block, which are placed above the red ring-shaped block.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nTo construct the structure on the left:\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**  One triangle shaped block (orange), one large triangle shaped block (orange), one blue square block, and one cylindrical block (orange).\n* **List of Block Indices:** 13, 14, 5, 10\n\nTo construct the structure on the right:\n\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** one red ring-shaped block, one green square block, one blue square block, one yellow square block, one orange triangular block, one orange triangular block ,and one orange triangular block.\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 3, 6, 5, 7, 13, 13, 13\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Left Structure**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10\nStep2: Move block with index 13\nStep3: Move block with index 14\nStep4: Move block with index 5\n}\n```\n\n**Right Structure**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 3\nStep2: Move block with index 13\nStep3: Move block with index 13\nStep4: Move block with index 6\nStep5: Move block with index 5\nStep6: Move block with index 7\nStep7: Move block with index 13\n}\n```"

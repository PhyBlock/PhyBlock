            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows a structure composed of various colored blocks.  There are at least 12 blocks.  There are two distinct parts: a small vehicle-like structure and a bridge-like structure.  The vehicle is composed of two cylindrical blocks and a stack of cuboidal blocks. The bridge is made of rectangular blocks, arched blocks, and other shaped blocks. The structures sit on a dark background with a checkered pattern.  \n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the image, the following blocks are required, and their corresponding indices are listed below:\n\n\n| Block Feature               | Block Index |\n|------------------------------|--------------|\n| Orange Cylinder             | 10           |\n| Green Cuboidal             | 6            |\n| Blue Cuboidal              | 3            |\n| Orange Cuboidal (roof)       | 4            |\n| Red Cuboidal                | 1            |\n| Yellow Cuboidal             | 9            |\n| Green Arch                 | 14           |\n| Orange Arch                 | 1            |\n| Yellow Arch                 | 1            |\n| Orange Cuboidal (bridge base)| 4            |\n| Red Cuboidal (bridge base)  | 5            |\n| Red Cuboidal (bridge top) | 1            |\n\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder)\nStep2: Move block with index 6 (green cuboidal) on top of block with index 10 (orange cylinder)\nStep3: Move block with index 3 (blue cuboidal) on top of block with index 6 (green cuboidal)\nStep4: Move block with index 1 (orange arch) to the right\nStep5: Move block with index 1 (red cuboidal) on the right of block with index 1 (orange arch)\nStep6: Move block with index 9 (yellow cuboidal) on the right of block with index 1 (orange arch)\nStep7: Move block with index 4 (orange cuboidal) next to the yellow block\nStep8: Move block with index 1 (orange arch) to the right\nStep9: Move block with index 1 (red cuboidal) on the right of block with index 1 (orange arch)\nStep10: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder) to the left, placing the two cylinders side-by-side.\nStep11: Move block with index 14 (green arch) below the row of orange and yellow blocks, connecting them. \nStep12: Move block with index 1 (orange arch) above the connected arch. \nStep13: Move block with index 4 (orange cuboidal) to the top right corner\nStep14: Move block with index 4 (orange cuboidal) next to the yellow block, completing the bridge structure.\nStep15: Move block with index 1 (orange arch) to complete the bridge.\nStep16 : Move block with index 5 (red cuboidal) onto the base of the bridge\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  This assembly sequence is a high-level interpretation.  A precise, step-by-step physical construction would require more detailed instructions, particularly if there are hidden blocks, or alternative structures that could also work. The orientation of some blocks may not be clear without greater detail.  Without a clear 3D view, it is difficult to fully reconstruct the precise order.\n"

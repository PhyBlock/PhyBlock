The arrangement is as follows:\n\n* **Bottom Layer:**  Two reddish-orange arch-shaped blocks (1 and 2) are placed side-by-side, supporting a yellow block (5) positioned between them. Two reddish-orange rectangular blocks (3) rest on top of the yellow block.\n\n\n* **Middle Layer:**  A taller, reddish-orange cylindrical block (9) sits vertically on the right side. A horizontal, yellow block (4) is placed directly on top of the reddish-orange cylindrical block(9). An L-shaped yellow block (7) is also placed on top of the reddish-orange cylindrical block, but offset slightly to the left.\n\n\n* **Top Layer:**  A reddish-orange cylindrical block (9) is placed directly on top of another reddish-orange cylindrical block (9), forming a stacked structure. A reddish-orange triangular block (13) is on top of the second cylindrical block.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the main target image, the following blocks from the dictionary are required:\n\n* Block 1\n* Block 2\n* Block 3\n* Block 4\n* Block 5\n* Block 7\n* Block 9\n* Block 13\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 3 on top of block 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 3 on top of block 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 4 on top of block 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 7 on top of block 9\n    Step9: Move block with index 9 on top of block 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 13 on top of block 9\n}\n"

It has 3 layers. The blocks are stacked vertically.\n\n   **Structure 2 (Arch):** Consists of 7 blocks. 2 yellow rectangular block pillars, 2 orange rectangular blocks, 2 orange arched blocks, and 1 orange rectangular block on the top. It has 3 layers. The two yellow pillars are the base, with the two orange rectangles supporting the arched block, and the orange top block completing the structure.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1 (Tower):**\n   - Block 3 (blue square)\n   - Block 4 (red rectangular)\n   - Block 13 (orange triangular)\n\n\n   **Structure 2 (Arch):**\n   - Block 9 (yellow rectangular)\n   - Block 1 (orange arched)\n   - Block 4 (red rectangular)\n   - Block 1 (orange arched)\n   - Block 4 (red rectangular)\n   - Block 4 (red rectangular)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n   \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n   \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n   \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The assembly order for structure 2 is critical to the correct placement of blocks.   Steps 1 and 2 are the yellow rectangular blocks as the base. Step 3 and 4 are the arched blocks on top of the pillars. Steps 5-8 are the rectangular blocks and steps 9 and 10 build the top section of the structure.  Step 11 completes structure 1.  \n\n**Structure 1 (Tower) Assembly Order (Simplified):**\n\nThe assembly order would be to first place the rectangular block, then the square block, and then the triangular block to complete the tower."

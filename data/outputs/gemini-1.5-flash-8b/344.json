            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main image shows two structures: a small house and a simple vehicle.\n\n* **House:** Composed of 5 blocks, arranged in 3 layers.  The blocks are various shapes and colors.\n* **Vehicle:** Composed of 4 blocks, in 2 layers. The blocks are cylindrical, rectangular, and curved.\n\nSpatial relationships:  The blocks in each structure are specifically positioned above or adjacent to each other.  Careful observation of the image is crucial to understand the precise stacking order and arrangement.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the colors and shapes of the blocks in the main image, here's the required blocks from the dictionary, along with their indices:\n\n| Structure | Block Indices |\n|---|---|\n| **House** | 1, 13, 13, 3, 2 |\n| **Vehicle** | 9, 4, 5, 10 |\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13 on top of block 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3 next to the 13 block\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2 on top of block 3\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 3 on top of block 13\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 4 on top of block 9\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5 next to block 4\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10 next to block 5\" \n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The assembly order for the house and vehicle is independent, so steps can be reordered as necessary, so long as the appropriate blocks for the house and vehicle are placed correctly in the specified location.  This solution focuses on the house first, then the vehicle.  A slightly different assembly sequence is possible, as the structure allows for slightly different placement orders for each component."

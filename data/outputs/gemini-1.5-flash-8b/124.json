The bottom layer has two red blocks, and the top layer has a yellow rectangular block and a yellow curved block resting on top of the red blocks. The yellow rectangular block is positioned horizontally with its longer side parallel to the bottom. The yellow curved block sits atop the yellow rectangular block and is positioned such that its curved part is towards the front of the image. The red blocks are positioned on the bottom layer, with their openings facing outwards.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:**  Block 6 (red), Block 1 (red), Block 9 (yellow), Block 10 (yellow) are needed.\n   * **List of Block Indices:** 6, 1, 9, 10\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Place block with index 6 on top of block with index 1(matching the opening orientation).\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Place block with index 9 on top of the blocks with index 6 and 1 (matching the openings).\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Place block with index 10 on top of the block with index 9 (matching the curve to the top of the block index 9).\"\n}\n```\n"

Layers are apparent; the structure is not completely flat. Blocks are positioned in various orientations, some appear above, below, and beside others. The blocks exhibit different shapes: rectangles, arches, and triangles. Colors present are red, yellow, green, and blue.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:** The structure requires the following blocks as shown in the provided dictionary:\n     * Block Index 1 (red arch) x2\n     * Block Index 2 (red block) x 1\n     * Block Index 5 (green block) x 1\n     * Block Index 6 (red block) x 1\n     * Block Index 7 (yellow block) x 2\n     * Block Index 9 (yellow block) x1\n     * Block Index 3 (blue block) x1\n     * Block Index 11 (orange triangle) x1\n     * Block Index 12 (orange triangle) x1\n     * Block Index 10(green block) x 1\n \n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7 (yellow block)\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1 (red arch) on top of index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7 (yellow block) beside the first one\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1 (red arch) on top of the second index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2 (red block) under the index 1 archs\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6 (red block) beside index 2 (red block)\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9 (yellow block) under index 7\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3 (blue block) on top of index 9\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 5 (green block) on top of index 6\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 10 (green block) to the right of index 9\",\n   \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 11 (orange triangle) on top of index 10\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 12 (orange triangle) on the other side of index 11\",\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:** This assembly order is a *potential* solution.  Precise step-by-step assembly instructions are challenging without knowing exactly the order of placement and which block is placed where first. If further context or visual detail of the placement is available, a more precise and accurate assembly sequence could be determined."

There are 3 layers.  The blocks are arranged in a slightly irregular vertical formation.\n\n\n* **Structure 2 (Base):**  Composed of 3 blocks. The structure is a base made of 2 rectangular blocks and one arched block.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the target image and the block dictionary:\n\n* **Structure 1 (Tower):**\n    * Block Index 2 (Blue Cube)\n    * Block Index 3 (Green Cube)\n    * Block Index 4 (Blue Square)\n    * Block Index 5 (Green Rectangular Prism)\n    * Block Index 6 (Yellow Rectangular Prism)\n    * Block Index 7 (Yellow Rectangular Prism)\n    * Block Index 13 (Orange Triangular Prism)\n\n* **Structure 2 (Base):**\n    * Block Index 1 (Red Arch)\n    * Block Index 9 (Orange Cylinder)\n    * Block Index 10 (Yellow Rectangular Prism)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1 (Red Arch)\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10 (Yellow Rectangular Prism) on top of block index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1 (Red Arch) on top of block index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5 (Green Rectangular Prism) on top of block index 10\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6 (Yellow Rectangular Prism) on top of block index 5\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7 (Yellow Rectangular Prism) on top of block index 6\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2 (Blue Cube) on top of block index 7\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3 (Green Cube) on top of block index 2\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 4 (Blue Square) on top of block index 3\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 13 (Orange Triangular Prism) on top of block index 4\",\n\t\"Step11\": \"Move block with index 9 (Orange Cylinder)\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 10 (Yellow Rectangular Prism) next to block index 1\"\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:** The exact order for the blocks in the tower might vary based on the desired arrangement. The provided assembly order assumes a progression from bottom to top and left to right in the main image, though it is difficult to determine an absolute \"correct\" ordering from the visual representation.  The order for the tower blocks is a possible interpretation to align with the visual. For the base, there is more certainty as the spatial relationship is more direct."

There are two layers of green blocks in each stack.  The green blocks are arranged horizontally.\n\n* **Section 2 (Right):** Composed of two yellow rectangular blocks stacked vertically to form a double-sided structure.  The structure has two layers with one yellow block stacked on top of the other.\n\nThere are a total of 7 blocks in the structure (5 orange/coral cylinders + 2 green rectangles + 2 yellow rectangles).  It has 3 layers (2 layers of green, and 1 layer of yellow).\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Section 1 (Left):**\n    * Block Index 13: Orange cylinder\n    * Block Index 1: Green rectangle\n    * Block Index 1: Green rectangle\n\n\n* **Section 2 (Right):**\n   * Block Index 7: Yellow rectangle\n   * Block Index 7: Yellow rectangle\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n   \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 7\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The exact order of placing the orange and green blocks on each orange cylinder is implied by the image but not explicitly shown. The given instructions prioritize the order in which each block should be picked up from the dictionary.  A more complete assembly instruction would include the precise position/location of each block on the supports, which is beyond the capability of a simple analysis of these images.\n"

The green rectangular blocks are positioned vertically, with a small, triangular orange/red block on top.  Below the green blocks, there are 2 layers of red blocks with arched openings. A yellow rectangular block forms the base.  The spatial relationships are: the yellow block is below the red blocks, the green blocks are above the red blocks, and the orange/red triangular block is positioned on top of the green blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the visual analysis, these blocks from the dictionary are required:\n\n*   Block 1 (Red Arch)\n*   Block 2 (Red Arch)\n*   Block 3 (Red Arch)\n*   Block 4 (Red Arch)\n*   Block 5 (Green Rectangle)\n*   Block 6 (Green Rectangle)\n*   Block 9 (Yellow Rectangle)\n*   Block 13 (Red Rectangle)\n*   Block 14 (Orange/Red Triangle)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 9\nStep2: Move block with index 13\nStep3: Move block with index 2 on top of block 13\nStep4: Move block with index 3 on top of block 13 to the right of block 2\nStep5: Move block with index 1 on top of block 2\nStep6: Move block with index 4 on top of block 3\nStep7: Move block with index 5 on top of block 2 and 3\nStep8: Move block with index 6 on top of block 5\nStep9: Move block with index 14 on top of block 5 and 6\n```\n"

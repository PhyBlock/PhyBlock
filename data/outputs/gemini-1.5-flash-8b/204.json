The blocks are a red arch, a blue square, a green rectangular block, and a red triangular block.  The arch is on the bottom, followed by the square, then the rectangle, and the triangular block on top of the rectangle.\n\n* **Structure 2 (Right):** This structure has 6 blocks in 3 layers.  The blocks are a yellow rectangular block, two orange cylindrical blocks, two orange roof-shaped blocks (triangular with a top point), and a small orange rectangular block. The orange cylinders form the base of the tower with the roofs arranged on top of the middle cylinder. A small orange block is positioned horizontally at the top of this base. The yellow block is situated horizontally on top of the two orange cylinders, forming a bridge-like structure.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure 1:**\n    * Block 1 (Red Arch)\n    * Block 3 (Blue Square)\n    * Block 5 (Green Rectangle)\n    * Block 13 (Red Triangle)\n\n\n* **Structure 2:**\n    * Block 9 (Yellow Rectangle)\n    * Block 10 (Orange Cylinder) x2\n    * Block 14 (Orange Roof) x2\n    * Block 11 (Small Orange Rectangle)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 3\nStep3: Move block with index 5\nStep4: Move block with index 13\nStep5: Move block with index 10\nStep6: Move block with index 10\nStep7: Move block with index 14\nStep8: Move block with index 14\nStep9: Move block with index 9\nStep10: Move block with index 11\n}\n"

The structure is 3 blocks high (3 layers). The blocks stack vertically. The green block is in the middle; the red is on the green; the blue is on the red.\n\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Cross):** Composed of 5 blocks: four orange triangular prisms and one green square prism. The blocks form a cross shape. The green block is centrally located, and the four orange blocks are positioned around it.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (Tower):**\n      * Block 1 (Blue Cube)\n      * Block 6 (Red Rectangular Prism)\n      * Block 2 (Green Rectangular Prism)\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Cross):**\n      * Block 13 (Orange Triangular Prism)  x 4\n      * Block 2 (Green Square Prism)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (Tower):**\n      ```\n      Step1: Move block with index 6\n      Step2: Move block with index 2\n      Step3: Move block with index 1\n      ```\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Cross):**\n      ```\n      Step1: Move block with index 2\n      Step2: Move block with index 13\n      Step3: Move block with index 13\n      Step4: Move block with index 13\n      Step5: Move block with index 13\n      ```"

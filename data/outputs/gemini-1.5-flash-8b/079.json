The base layer is made up of 3 orange triangular blocks, one yellow rectangular block, and one red block with a curved top. The middle layer has two blocks, one with a hole (red cylinder) and a green square block. The top layer is composed of two blue square blocks and one orange triangular block.  The blocks are arranged in a triangular/arch-like design.  The spatial relationships are essential for determining the correct assembly order.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**\n    * Block 1 (red, curved): 1\n    * Block 3 (red, curved): 1\n    * Block 9 (yellow): 1\n    * Block 13 (orange triangle): 3\n    * Block 15 (orange triangle): 1\n    * Block 6 (blue): 2\n    * Block 7 (green): 1\n    * Block 4 (red, curved):1\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 3, 9, 13, 13, 13, 6, 7, 4 ,15, 6\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 9\nStep3: Move block with index 13\nStep4: Move block with index 13\nStep5: Move block with index 13\nStep6: Move block with index 3\nStep7: Move block with index 6\nStep8: Move block with index 7\nStep9: Move block with index 4\nStep10: Move block with index 15\nStep11: Move block with index 6\n```\n"

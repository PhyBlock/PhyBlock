The structure on the left uses 4 blocks arranged in 2 layers.\n\n   * **Structure on the Right:**\n      * **Block Count:** 7\n      * **Layers:** 3\n      * **Spatial Relationships:** A red rectangular block (likely #14) forms the base. A tall, orange cylindrical block (#7?) sits on top of it, followed by a triangular red block (#15?) on top of the cylinder.  The rest of the structure is made of a  yellow rectangular block (#12?) and the arch/bridge piece (#1).\n\n   * **Structure on the Left:**\n      * **Block Count:** 4\n      * **Layers:** 2\n      * **Spatial Relationships:** Two orange cylinders (#9) form the base. A blue cube (#3) sits atop the cylinders. A yellow semi-circular block (#10) is on top of a section of the base.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure on the Right:**\n      * Block Index 1 (arch/bridge piece)\n      * Block Index 7 (orange cylinder)\n      * Block Index 14 (red rectangular block)\n      * Block Index 15 (red triangular block)\n      * Block Index 12 (yellow rectangular block)\n\n\n   * **Structure on the Left:**\n      * Block Index 3 (blue cube)\n      * Block Index 9 (orange cylinder)\n      * Block Index 10 (yellow semi-circular block)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   * **Structure on the Right:**\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n        \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7 on top of block 14\",\n        \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12 to the side of block 7\",\n        \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1 on top of block 12\",\n        \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 15 on top of block 7\"\n      }\n      ```\n\n   * **Structure on the Left:**\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n        \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9 again, next to the first\",\n        \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3 on top of the cylinders\",\n        \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10 on the front of the cylinders\",\n      }\n      ```\n\n**Important Note:**  Precise block indexing is challenging without clearer visual detail in the dictionary, especially with the ambiguous block shapes and orientations.   The provided solution is based on reasonable estimations and assumptions, and the final block arrangement may vary slightly if a different interpretation of the source image was made.  Lack of consistent dimensions and precise alignment between main image and dictionary images makes a perfect match difficult.\n"

The blocks are arranged in a slightly irregular, but discernible, pattern.\n\n\n* **Layer 1:**  The base layer has two central vertical cylindrical blocks (yellow, block 11, 12) and a few smaller blocks arranged around them, including a triangle block (13), a cube-shaped block (5) and a rectangle block (6 or 7).\n\n* **Layer 2:** A curved block (1 or 2, depending on image orientation, but red and curved in both cases) sits on top of each of the yellow cylindrical blocks, and a combination of a rectangular (6 or 7) and a square (5 or 8) block is sitting on the layer 1 blocks. Finally, another small triangular block (13) sits adjacent to the stack.\n\n* **Layer 3:** A small red roof-like structure (made of two inclined blocks, likely 13 or 14, but orange-red in both cases) is sitting atop the curved blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the visual analysis of the target structure and the block dictionary, the required blocks are:\n\n\n| Block in Target Structure|Corresponding Block Index in the Dictionary|\n|---|---|\n|Red Curved Block|1 (or 2)|\n|Red Curved Block | 3 (or 4) |\n| Yellow Cylindrical Block | 11|\n| Yellow Cylindrical Block | 12|\n|Blue Cube Block| 5|\n| Yellow Rectangular Block | 6|\n| Green Rectangular Block| 7|\n| Triangle Block| 13|\n| Orange Triangular Block | 14| (for the roof)\n| Orange Triangular Block | 15| (for the roof)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n    Step10: Move block with index 15\n}\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact order may vary slightly depending on the exact interpretation of the image.  If the blocks 1 and 2 are considered interchangeable, the steps would change slightly."

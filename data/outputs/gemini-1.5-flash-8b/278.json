The blocks are arranged in a slightly staggered manner. A red curved block is placed directly below and behind another red curved block, a blue cube is placed atop the curved blocks, and a green/yellow combination block sits to the right and slightly behind the blue cube.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Needed Blocks:**\n\n   * **Block 1:**  (Red curved block)\n   * **Block 2:** (Red curved block)\n   * **Block 6:** (Blue cube)\n   * **Block 11:**(Yellow curved block)\n   * **Block 7:** (Green curved block)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   {\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 6 on top of blocks 1 and 2.\n   Step4: Move block with index 11 to the right of, and slightly behind, blocks 1, 2 and 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 7 to the right and slightly behind block 11, above the curved blocks in the other half of the structure.\n\n   }\n"

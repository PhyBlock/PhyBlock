If so, it is not possible to match the structure from the given image)\n\n   **Structure 2 (Car):**\n   * Block Index 9 (Orange Cylinder) x 2\n   * Block Index 7 (Yellow Rectangle)\n   * Block Index 1 (Blue Cube)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 9\nStep2: Move block with index 3\nStep3: Move block with index 2\nStep4: Move block with index 9\nStep5: Move block with index 15\nStep6: Move block with index 9\nStep7: Move block with index 7\nStep8: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\n**Important Considerations and Potential Issues:**\n\n* **Exact Matching:**  The assembly order is crucial to achieve the *exact* structure from the image. \n* **Missing Block:** It's impossible to perfectly match the top-level triangular block. The image provided in the block dictionary lacks a rotationally equivalent configuration.\n* **Ambiguity:**  Several blocks appear similar (e.g., the orange cylinders).  Additional visual cues or block specifications would be necessary to ensure absolute certainty about block selection in these situations.\n\n* **Alternative Interpretation:** The structure may require a block that is not represented in the provided dictionary or have a different orientation. If the block selection was incorrect, this is possible."

            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n   The main image shows a structure built from various colored blocks, including cubes, and arches.  There are at least 10 blocks visible, potentially more hidden.  The structure appears to be composed of at least 3 layers. The blocks are arranged in a somewhat irregular, but interconnected, design.  Blocks are stacked, placed side-by-side, and used in arched arrangements.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   Based on the main image and the block dictionary, the required block indices are:\n\n   * **1:**  Red Arch\n   * **2:** Red Arch\n   * **3:** Red Arch\n   * **4:** Red Arch (with Green on top)\n   * **5:** Blue Cube\n   * **6:** Red Cube\n   * **7:** Green Rectangular Block\n   * **8:** Green Rectangular Block (flipped)\n   * **10:** Yellow Rectangular Block\n   * **11:** Yellow Rectangular Block\n   * **13:** Yellow Arch\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13 on top of block 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1 on top of block 13\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10 on top of block 2\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1 on top of block 10\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 7 next to block 10\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 11 next to block 7\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 11 on top of block 3\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 8 next to block 1\",\n  \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 4 on top of block 8\",\n   \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 1 on the right of block 3\",\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Hidden Blocks:** The assembly sequence is *possible*, but a complete view of all blocks in the layers is needed to create a 100% accurate order. Parts of the structure are likely obscured.\n* **Multiple Solutions:** There might be other valid assembly orders that would achieve the same result.\n* **Block Placement Details:**  Without exact measurements or a 3D model of the structure, a completely exact assembly sequence is very difficult to determine. The suggested order is a reasonable interpretation based on the 2D images provided."

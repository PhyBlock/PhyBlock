It has 7 blocks in total, arranged in 4 layers.  The blocks are various colors (blue, red, yellow, and green).  There are 3 rectangular/cuboid blocks, a curved/arched block, and 2 rectangular blocks of varying lengths. The spatial relationships are:\n\n- Block 1 (blue square) is on top of block 2 (red rectangle)\n- Block 3 (yellow rectangular) is on top of block 4 (green rectangular)\n- Block 2 (red) is positioned directly below block 1 (blue).\n- Block 4 (green rectangle) is to the left of block 3 (yellow)\n- Block 5 (yellow) is positioned under and adjacent to the other blocks.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n\nTo replicate the structure exactly, the following blocks are needed, with their corresponding indices:\n\n- Block 1 (blue square): Index 1\n- Block 2 (red rectangle): Index 3\n- Block 3 (yellow rectangular): Index 10\n- Block 4 (green rectangular): Index 9\n- Block 5 (curved/arched yellow): Index 13\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the assembly order is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

Two are rectangular prisms (one green, one yellow), and one is a square prism (blue).  It has two layers. The green block sits above the yellow block, and the blue block is centered in the gap.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):** The structure is composed of 6 blocks.  Four are curved blocks (red), one is a rectangular prism (yellow), and another is a slightly taller rectangular prism (red). This structure also has two layers. It has a curved support structure in the shape of a semi-circle on top of the other parts.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Structure 1:**\n* Block 13: Green Rectangular Prism (horizontal)\n* Block 6: Blue Square Prism\n* Block 10: Yellow Rectangular Prism (horizontal)\n\n**Structure 2:**\n* Block 1: Red Curved Block (horizontal)\n* Block 2: Red Curved Block (horizontal)\n* Block 1: Red Curved Block (horizontal)\n* Block 4: Red Curved Block (horizontal)\n* Block 14: Yellow Rectangular Prism (horizontal)\n* Block 1: Red Curved Block (horizontal)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Structure 1:**\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10\nStep2: Move block with index 13 on top of block 10\nStep3: Move block with index 6 into the gap between block 10 and 13\n}\n\n**Structure 2:**\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 1 next to block 1\nStep3: Move block with index 4 on top of blocks 1 and 2\nStep4: Move block with index 1 next to block 1 and 2 and 4\nStep5: Move block with index 14 next to block 1 and 2 and 4\nStep6: Move block with index 1 on top of blocks 1, 2, 4 and 14\n\n}\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact assembly order of the second structure is complex and would be more clear with clearer labeling of block orientation and relative positions in the target image.  The above attempt makes the best possible inference with the information available.   The structure is highly symmetrical in the picture though so a full block-by-block instructions could be possible."

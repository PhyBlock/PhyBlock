The blocks are various colors (orange, green, blue, and yellow). The spatial relationships are as follows: The bottom layer consists of a single, horizontally-oriented green block.  A vertically-oriented orange block sits atop the green block. A yellow block sits above the orange, and then two vertically-oriented blue blocks are above it, and so on. The top layer is formed by two triangular orange blocks meeting at the top to create a peaked roof shape.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the image, the required blocks and their indices are:\n\n\n* Block 2 (Green Square)\n* Block 3 (Orange Square)\n* Block 5 (Yellow Square)\n* Block 6 (Blue Square)\n* Block 9 (Orange Triangle)\n* Block 13 (Orange Triangle)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2\nStep2: Move block with index 3 on top of block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 5 on top of block with index 3\nStep4: Move block with index 6 on top of block with index 5\nStep5: Move block with index 6 on top of block with index 5\nStep6: Move block with index 3 on the right side of block with index 6\nStep7: Move block with index 9 on top of block with index 3\nStep8: Move block with index 13 on top of block with index 9, and on top of block with index 9 to form the peaked roof\n}"

The first is a chair-like structure and the second a small rocket.\n\n* **Chair Structure:**  Composed of 5 blocks. It has 3 layers.  The base consists of 2 vertically stacked blocks (green).  A horizontal block (yellow) sits on top of the two vertical blocks. A taller, vertically oriented block (blue) is on top of the horizontal block. A slanted, curved block (yellow) sits on top of the blue block. Finally, a rectangular block (red) is placed on the top left portion of the structure sitting on top of the blue block.\n\n* **Rocket Structure:** Composed of 6 blocks. It has 3 layers.  The base consists of a yellow block with a rectangular shape, and a rectangular red block on top of it. A green block with a rectangular shape is to the right of the yellow base and sitting on top of the red block.  On top of the combined base a rectangular orange block is placed, and at the top, two smaller orange triangular blocks.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis and matching block shapes and colors:\n\n* **Chair Structure Blocks:**\n    * Block 5 (green vertical block) - x2\n    * Block 7 (yellow horizontal block)\n    * Block 3 (blue vertical block)\n    * Block 13 (red rectangular block)\n    * Block 9 (yellow curved block)\n\n* **Rocket Structure Blocks:**\n    * Block 7 (yellow rectangular block)\n    * Block 13 (red rectangular block)\n    * Block 6 (green rectangular block)\n    * Block 14 (orange triangular block) x2\n    * Block 11 (orange rectangular block)\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 5\n  Step2: Move block with index 5\n  Step3: Move block with index 7\n  Step4: Move block with index 3\n  Step5: Move block with index 13\n  Step6: Move block with index 9\n\n  Step7: Move block with index 7\n  Step8: Move block with index 13\n  Step9: Move block with index 6\n  Step10: Move block with index 14\n  Step11: Move block with index 14\n  Step12: Move block with index 11\n\n}\n"

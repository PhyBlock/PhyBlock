It has 2 layers. The blocks include two orange cylindrical blocks, one yellow rectangular block, and one orange triangular block. The yellow block is placed between the two orange cylindrical blocks and the orange triangular block is placed on top of the yellow block.\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Frame):** This structure consists of 5 blocks. It has 2 layers. The blocks include two green rectangular blocks, one yellow rectangular block and two red rectangular blocks. The yellow block is placed between the two green blocks, and the two red blocks sit on top of the two green blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (Arch):**\n      * Block Index 9 (Orange Cylinder)\n      * Block Index 6 (Yellow Rectangle)\n      * Block Index 13 (Orange Triangle)\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Frame):**\n      * Block Index 5 (Green Rectangle)\n      * Block Index 3 (Yellow Rectangle)\n      * Block Index 2 (Red Square)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1 (Arch)\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step 2: Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step 3: Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 13\"\n  ],\n  \"Structure 2 (Frame)\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 5\",\n\t\"Step 2: Move block with index 3\",\n\t\"Step 3: Move block with index 5\",\n\t\"Step 4: Move block with index 2\",\n\t\"Step 5: Move block with index 2\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n"

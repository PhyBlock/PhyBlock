A yellow block is on top of those, and positioned in between them.  The top layer has two red blocks resting on top of the middle layer, and arranged beside each other.  The red blocks have a curved side that are on the front and back of the structure. The yellow block is rectangular and oriented horizontally.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:**  2 red blocks with curved sides (block # 1), one yellow block that is horizontal (block # 9), and two red blocks with curved sides (block #1).\n   * **List of Block Indices:** 1, 9, 1\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1 next to block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9 on top of blocks with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1 on top of block with index 9\",\n   \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1 next to block with index 1\"\n\n}\n```"

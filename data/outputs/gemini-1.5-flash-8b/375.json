The structure on the left is a 3-layer tall, 2-wide tower with a hollow interior (tunnel). The structure on the right is a 3-layer tall, 2-wide structure with a small opening.  A total of at least 10 blocks are visible (counting the visible parts of each structure).\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure on the Left:**\n\n   * Block 1 (Red, curved shape,  1, circular, base): 1\n   * Block 5 (Green, rectangular, thin): 2\n   * Block 1 (Red, curved shape,  1, circular, base): 1\n   * Block 6 (Green, rectangular, thick): 1\n   * Block 1 (Red, curved shape,  1, circular, base): 1\n   * Block 4 (Blue, cube): 1\n   * Block 7 (Yellow, rectangular, thin): 1\n\n   **Structure on the Right:**\n\n\n   * Block 13 (Orange, rectangular, thick): 2\n   * Block 14 (Orange, triangular): 1\n   * Block 6 (Green, rectangular, thick): 1\n\n   * Block 7 (Yellow, rectangular, thin): 1\n   * Block 15 (Orange, cylinder): 1\n   * Block 13 (Orange, rectangular, thick): 2\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 5 on top of block 1\nStep3: Move block with index 1 on top of block 5\nStep4: Move block with index 6 on top of block 1\nStep5: Move block with index 1 on top of block 6\nStep6: Move block with index 4 on top of block 1\nStep7: Move block with index 7 on top of block 1, in the middle\nStep8: Move block with index 13\nStep9: Move block with index 14 on top of block 13\nStep10: Move block with index 6 on top of block 14\nStep11: Move block with index 15 on top of block 6, in the middle\nStep12: Move block with index 13 on top of block 15\nStep13: Move block with index 7 on the top of block 15\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The provided image for the Block Dictionary is a bit small and there is a potential for ambiguity in the exact arrangement of blocks.  Without a larger image, or additional information, there may be different interpretations of the orientation and layer positioning. The assembly instructions are based on the visible blocks and relative positions, but there might be small variations dependent on the exact positions of the hidden portions of the structures.\n"

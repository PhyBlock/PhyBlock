These support blocks are arranged in a triangular shape.\n\n   **Structure 2 (on the right):** This structure has a base of a horizontal rectangular block (likely #8 from the dictionary) positioned underneath a horizontal rectangular block (likely #8) on top of which is a vertical rectangular block (likely #6 or #10).   The right and left sides of the structure are supported by a slanted (truncated) rectangular block (likely #1) and a vertical rectangular block (likely #6 or #10). A triangular block (likely #13) sits on top. A small square block (likely #5) is placed at the center top. Finally, a small rectangular block (likely #5)  is placed on the top right of the structure.  \n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure 1:**\n      * Block Index 13 (Triangular)\n      * Block Index 10 (Tall Rectangle, Orange) x3\n      * Block Index 10 (Tall Rectangle, Orange) x3\n\n\n   * **Structure 2:**\n      * Block Index 8 (Long Rectangle, Yellow)\n      * Block Index 8 (Long Rectangle, Yellow)\n      * Block Index 6 (Tall Rectangle, Blue)\n      * Block Index 1 (Truncated Rectangle, Red)\n      * Block Index 6 (Tall Rectangle, Blue)\n      * Block Index 5 (Small Square, Green)\n      * Block Index 13 (Triangular, Orange)\n      \n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 10\",\n\t\"Step 2: Move block with index 10\",\n\t\"Step 3: Move block with index 10\",\n\t\"Step 4: Move block with index 13\"\n\t],\n\t\"Structure 2\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step 2: Move block with index 8\",\n\t\"Step 3: Move block with index 6\",\n\t\"Step 4: Move block with index 1\",\n\t\"Step 5: Move block with index 6\",\n\t\"Step 6: Move block with index 5\",\n\t\"Step 7: Move block with index 13\"\n\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  Without being able to see the exact colors and shapes of the blocks, some choices are inferred from the image.   Precise identification may require an additional visualization tool or a more detailed description of the color scheme.  The \"Move block\" instructions refer to the order of stacking."

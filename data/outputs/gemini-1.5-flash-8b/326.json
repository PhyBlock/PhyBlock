The first layer on the bottom has 3 curved red blocks arranged in a row. Atop of those, the second layer consists of 2 curved red blocks, with a smaller blue cube positioned centrally on top of the second layer, between the two red blocks. The top layer is formed by a yellow block positioned horizontally above the curved red blocks, followed by a circular red block in the center, and a second yellow block on top of that.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nTo replicate the structure exactly, the following blocks are needed from the provided dictionary, along with their indices:\n\n* **Block 2:** Red curved block (x2 for the 2nd layer)\n* **Block 3:** Red curved block\n* **Block 1:** Red curved block\n* **Block 9:** Blue cube\n* **Block 13:** Yellow block (x2)\n* **Block 14:** Red block (circular)\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2 (next to 1)\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2 (next to 3)\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9 on top of block 2 and 3\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13 on top of the blue cube and between blocks 1 and 2\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14 on top of block 13\",\n   \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13 on top of block 14\"\n\n}\n```\n"

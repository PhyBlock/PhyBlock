It appears to have 3 layers.  The spatial relationships are: a red triangular block (likely index 15) sits on a green rectangular block (likely index 6). A reddish-orange cylindrical block (likely index 11) sits on top of the triangle-rectangle stack.  A slightly curved, reddish-orange block (likely index 1) sits above that, creating the final structure of the first set.\n\n   **Structure 2 (Right):** Composed of 4 blocks. It appears to have 2 layers. The spatial relationships are: A yellow rectangular block (likely index 9) forms the base. A red, square block (likely index 2) is placed on the yellow one, vertically stacked in the middle.  Next to it, and above the yellow block, are two vertically stacked blocks: green (likely index 7) and blue (likely index 4).\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1:**\n   * Block 1 (reddish-orange curved block)\n   * Block 11 (reddish-orange cylinder)\n   * Block 6 (green rectangle)\n   * Block 15 (red triangle)\n\n   **Structure 2:**\n   * Block 9 (yellow rectangle)\n   * Block 4 (blue rectangle)\n   * Block 7 (green rectangle)\n   * Block 2 (red rectangle)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 6\nStep2: Move block with index 15\nStep3: Move block with index 11\nStep4: Move block with index 1\nStep5: Move block with index 9\nStep6: Move block with index 2\nStep7: Move block with index 7\nStep8: Move block with index 4\n}\n```"

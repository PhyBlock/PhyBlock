The structure appears to have 2-3 layers, depending on how you count the structures on the bridge.  Blocks are arranged in various configurations; some are stacked vertically, others are placed horizontally, or at angles.  There are rectangular prisms, triangular prisms, and curved arch-like blocks used.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nTo replicate the target structure exactly, the following blocks are needed from the block dictionary, with their respective indices.\n\n\n* **Block Index 1:**  (Red curved block)\n* **Block Index 2:** (Red curved block)\n* **Block Index 3:** (Blue rectangular block)\n* **Block Index 4:** (Yellow rectangular block)\n* **Block Index 6:** (Red rectangular block)\n* **Block Index 7:** (Green rectangular block)\n* **Block Index 8:** (Yellow rectangular block)\n* **Block Index 10:** (Yellow curved block)\n* **Block Index 12:** (Yellow rectangular block)\n* **Block Index 14:** (Orange Triangular Block)\n* **Block Index 15:** (Orange Triangular Block)\n* **Block Index 16:** (Orange Triangular Block)\n\n* **Block Index 5:** (Green rectangular block)\n* **Block Index 13:** (Orange triangular block)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step 1: Move block with index 10\n    Step 2: Move block with index 1\n    Step 3: Move block with index 2\n    Step 4: Move block with index 3\n    Step 5: Move block with index 4\n    Step 6: Move block with index 8\n    Step 7: Move block with index 6\n    Step 8: Move block with index 7\n    Step 9: Move block with index 5\n    Step 10: Move block with index 12\n    Step 11: Move block with index 14\n    Step 12: Move block with index 15\n    Step 13: Move block with index 16\n    Step 14: Move block with index 13\n\n\n}\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact order of placement for some blocks might be subjective and could vary in how the structure is built. The provided steps attempt to reflect a possible assembly sequence based on the visual input.\n\n\n"

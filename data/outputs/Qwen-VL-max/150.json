The left structure has a base layer, a middle layer, and a top layer. The right structure has a base layer and a single vertical element.\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- **Left Structure:**\n  - Base Layer: Composed of three green rectangular blocks arranged in a row.\n  - Middle Layer: A red arch block is placed on the left side of the base layer, followed by a blue cube and an orange triangular block.\n  - Top Layer: An orange triangular block is placed on top of the blue cube.\n- **Right Structure:**\n  - Base Layer: Two green rectangular blocks are placed side by side.\n  - Vertical Element: A yellow half-cylinder is placed on top of a red cylinder, which is then placed on the base layer.\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n- **Indices:**\n  - Green Rectangular Block: Index 5\n  - Red Arch Block: Index 1\n  - Blue Cube: Index 4\n  - Orange Triangular Block: Index 15\n  - Yellow Half-Cylinder: Index 13\n  - Red Cylinder: Index 11\n\n## Assembly Order:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5 (Green Rectangular Block)\n   Step2: Move block with index 5 (Green Rectangular Block)\n   Step3: Move block with index 5 (Green Rectangular Block)\n   Step4: Move block with index 1 (Red Arch Block)\n   Step5: Move block with index 4 (Blue Cube)\n   Step6: Move block with index 15 (Orange Triangular Block)\n   Step7: Move block with index 15 (Orange Triangular Block)\n   Step8: Move block with index 5 (Green Rectangular Block)\n   Step9: Move block with index 5 (Green Rectangular Block)\n   Step10: Move block with index 11 (Red Cylinder)\n   Step11: Move block with index 13 (Yellow Half-Cylinder)\n}",

        "content": "### Analysis of the Main Target Image:\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 16 building blocks arranged in a multi-layered configuration. There are at least three distinct layers visible.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The base layer includes two red arches (blocks) positioned side by side, with a yellow rectangular block spanning between them.\n  - Above this, there is a green horizontal block and two blue cubes placed on top of it.\n  - To the right, there is a combination of orange triangular blocks and another set of red and yellow blocks forming a more complex arrangement.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required to match the target structure:\n\n- Red arches: Index 1\n- Yellow rectangular block: Index 7\n- Green horizontal block: Index 5\n- Blue cubes: Index 3\n- Orange triangular blocks: Index 14\n- Additional red and yellow blocks: Indices 2, 9, 10\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nThe assembly order can be inferred as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1,\n    Step2: Move block with index 1,\n    Step3: Move block with index 7,\n    Step4: Move block with index 5,\n    Step5: Move block with index 3,\n    Step6: Move block with index 3,\n    Step7: Move block with index 14,\n    Step8: Move block with index 14,\n    Step9: Move block with index 2,\n    Step10: Move block with index 9,\n    Step11: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that the structure is built layer by layer, starting from the base and moving upwards, while maintaining the correct spatial relationships between the blocks.",

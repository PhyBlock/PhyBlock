        "content": "### Analysis of the Main Target Image:\n\n1. **Count & Layers:**\n   - The structure consists of 12 building blocks.\n   - There are two main structures, each with multiple layers.\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships:**\n   - The left structure has a yellow rectangular block at the base, followed by two orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically. On top of these cylinders is a red arch-shaped block with an orange triangular roof.\n   - The right structure has a similar base but with additional blocks. It starts with a yellow rectangular block, then a green cube, and a blue cube on top. Above the blue cube is a red arch-shaped block with an orange triangular roof. The base also includes two red arch-shaped blocks on either side.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Block Indices:**\n  - Yellow rectangular block (base): Index 7\n  - Orange cylindrical block: Index 10\n  - Red arch-shaped block: Index 3\n  - Orange triangular roof: Index 14\n  - Green cube: Index 6\n  - Blue cube: Index 5\n  - Red arch-shaped block (side): Index 1\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7,\n  Step2: Move block with index 10,\n  Step3: Move block with index 10,\n  Step4: Move block with index 3,\n  Step5: Move block with index 14,\n  Step6: Move block with index 7,\n  Step7: Move block with index 6,\n  Step8: Move block with index 5,\n  Step9: Move block with index 3,\n  Step10: Move block with index 14,\n  Step11: Move block with index 1,\n  Step12: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that the structure is built layer by layer, matching the target image exactly.",

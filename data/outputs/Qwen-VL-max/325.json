There are two main structures, one taller and one shorter.\n  - The taller structure has four layers:\n    1. A yellow rectangular block at the base.\n    2. A red block with a circular cutout on top of it.\n    3. Two orange cylindrical blocks stacked vertically.\n    4. A yellow triangular block on top.\n  - The shorter structure has three layers:\n    1. A green rectangular block at the base.\n    2. A blue rectangular block on top of the green block.\n    3. A yellow rectangular block on top of the blue block.\n    4. A red block with a circular cutout on top of the yellow block.\n    5. A yellow semi-circular block on top of the red block.\n  - An orange triangular block is placed adjacent to the shorter structure.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The taller structure is positioned to the left of the shorter structure.\n  - The orange triangular block is placed to the right of the shorter structure, slightly overlapping with its base.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Block Indices:**\n  - Yellow rectangular block (base of taller structure): Index 7\n  - Red block with a circular cutout (second layer of taller structure): Index 3\n  - Orange cylindrical block (third layer of taller structure): Index 10\n  - Yellow triangular block (top of taller structure): Index 11\n  - Green rectangular block (base of shorter structure): Index 8\n  - Blue rectangular block (second layer of shorter structure): Index 5\n  - Yellow rectangular block (third layer of shorter structure): Index 7\n  - Red block with a circular cutout (fourth layer of shorter structure): Index 3\n  - Yellow semi-circular block (top of shorter structure): Index 11\n  - Orange triangular block (adjacent to shorter structure): Index 14\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 3\n   Step9: Move block with index 11\n   Step10: Move block with index 14\n}",

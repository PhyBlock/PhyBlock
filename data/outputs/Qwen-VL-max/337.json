The left structure has a base layer, a middle layer, and a top layer. The right structure has a base layer and a single layer on top.\n\n#### Spatial Relationships:\n- **Left Structure:**\n  - Base Layer: A yellow block (horizontal orientation).\n  - Middle Layer: A red block with a curved indentation on the left side, a green block, and an orange triangular block.\n  - Top Layer: Two blue blocks stacked vertically.\n- **Right Structure:**\n  - Base Layer: A yellow block (horizontal orientation).\n  - Top Layer: A yellow block (horizontal orientation) on top of a stack of a green block, an orange block, a blue block, and a red block.\n\n### Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are as follows:\n- **Yellow Block (Horizontal Orientation):** Index 12\n- **Red Block with Curved Indentation (Left Side):** Index 1\n- **Green Block:** Index 6\n- **Orange Triangular Block:** Index 15\n- **Blue Block:** Index 5\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nThe assembly order is as follows:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 12\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 15\n   Step5: Move block with index 5\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n   Step9: Move block with index 5\n   Step10: Move block with index 1\n}",

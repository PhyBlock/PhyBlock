The bottom layer comprises four cylindrical blocks, the middle layer includes a rectangular block and some smaller blocks, and the top layer features a dome-shaped block.\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- **Bottom Layer:** Four orange cylindrical blocks form the base, positioned in a square arrangement.\n- **Middle Layer:** \n  - A yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the cylinders.\n  - To the left of this block, there are two blue blocks with a green block in between them.\n  - Adjacent to these, there is an orange triangular block.\n- **Top Layer:** \n  - A yellow dome-shaped block sits atop the yellow rectangular block.\n  - There is also a small red block adjacent to the dome.\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are as follows:\n- **Cylindrical Blocks (Orange):** Index 8\n- **Rectangular Block (Yellow):** Index 7\n- **Dome-Shaped Block (Yellow):** Index 10\n- **Blue Blocks:** Index 5\n- **Green Block:** Index 1\n- **Triangular Block (Orange):** Index 16\n- **Small Red Block:** Index 3\n\n## Assembly Order:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 5\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 16\n   Step10: Move block with index 10\n   Step11: Move block with index 3\n}",

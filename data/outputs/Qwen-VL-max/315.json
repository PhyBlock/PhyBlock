The yellow block has a hollow section where the red block fits (block indices 15 and 13 from the dictionary for the yellow and green parts, respectively).\n  - The red block inside the yellow block is oriented such that its flat surface faces outward (block index 9 from the dictionary).\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n- **Block Indices:**\n  - Red block with curved indentation: Index 1\n  - Blue cube: Index 7\n  - Yellow block with hollow section: Index 15\n  - Green top for the yellow block: Index 13\n  - Red block inside the yellow block: Index 9\n\n### Assembly Order:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 15\n   Step4: Move block with index 13\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n}",

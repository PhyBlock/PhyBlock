There are three distinct layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The bottom layer includes two green rectangular blocks (one on the left and one on the right), two orange triangular blocks (one on the left and one on the right), and an orange cylindrical block in the center.\n  - The middle layer has a red arch-shaped block spanning across the top of the cylindrical block, with a small orange block on its right side.\n  - The top layer features an orange triangular block placed on top of the arch.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are:\n- Green rectangular blocks (indices 5 and 7)\n- Orange triangular blocks (indices 13 and 14)\n- Orange cylindrical block (index 9)\n- Red arch-shaped block (index 2)\n- Small orange block (index 10)\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nThe step-by-step assembly sequence is as follows:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 13\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 14\n   Step6: Move block with index 2\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n}",

There are two main structures, each with a distinct arrangement.\n  - The left structure has a base layer with a red block with a circular cutout, topped by a yellow rectangular block, and then two orange cylindrical blocks on either side of a yellow horizontal block.\n  - The right structure has a base layer with two green blocks, one on top of a red arch-shaped block, and another on top of a similar red arch-shaped block. Above these, there is a yellow horizontal block, followed by an orange cylindrical block, and finally, an orange triangular block on top.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The left structure has a symmetrical arrangement with the yellow horizontal block at the center, flanked by two orange cylindrical blocks.\n  - The right structure has a linear arrangement with the green blocks positioned above the red arches, and the yellow horizontal block serving as a platform for the orange cylindrical and triangular blocks.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Identified Needed Blocks:**\n  - Red block with a circular cutout (index 3)\n  - Yellow rectangular block (index 6)\n  - Orange cylindrical block (index 11)\n  - Yellow horizontal block (index 9)\n  - Green block (index 7)\n  - Red arch-shaped block (index 1)\n  - Orange triangular block (index 15)\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 9\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 7\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 9\n   Step11: Move block with index 11\n   Step12: Move block with index 15\n}",

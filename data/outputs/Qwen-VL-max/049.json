One yellow block is placed directly on top of the green block from the bottom layer, and the other yellow block is placed to the right of it.\n  - The top layer has a red block and a green block. The red block is placed to the right of the green block from the middle layer, and the green block is placed above the yellow block that forms the L-shape.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Block Indices:**\n  - Green Block (Bottom Layer): Index 7\n  - Yellow Block (L-shape, Left Side): Index 11\n  - Yellow Block (L-shape, Right Side): Index 11\n  - Red Block (Top Layer): Index 4\n  - Green Block (Top Layer): Index 8\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 11\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n}",

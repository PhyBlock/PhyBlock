The bottom layer includes a red bridge-like structure, the middle layer contains various shapes including a blue block with an orange roof and a green block, and the top layer features two yellow rectangular blocks.\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- **Bottom Layer:** A red bridge-like structure spans horizontally across the base.\n- **Middle Layer:** \n  - To the left of the bridge, there is a blue block with an orange roof.\n  - Adjacent to it, there is a yellow cylindrical block.\n  - To the right, there is a green block with an orange roof.\n  - Behind the green block, there are two yellow rectangular blocks standing vertically.\n- **Top Layer:** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed on top of the middle layer blocks.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are as follows:\n- Red bridge-like structure: Index 1\n- Blue block with orange roof: Index 4\n- Yellow cylindrical block: Index 11\n- Green block with orange roof: Index 7\n- Yellow rectangular blocks (vertical): Index 10\n\n## Assembly Order:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1 (Red bridge-like structure)\n   Step2: Move block with index 4 (Blue block with orange roof)\n   Step3: Move block with index 11 (Yellow cylindrical block)\n   Step4: Move block with index 7 (Green block with orange roof)\n   Step5: Move block with index 10 (Yellow rectangular block, vertical orientation)\n   Step6: Move block with index 10 (Second yellow rectangular block, vertical orientation)\n}",

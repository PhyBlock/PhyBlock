The larger structure has a base layer, a middle layer, and a top layer. The smaller structure has a base layer and a top layer.\n\n#### Spatial Relationships:\n- **Larger Structure:**\n  - The base layer consists of a red block with a circular cutout in the center, flanked by two yellow blocks on either side.\n  - The middle layer includes a blue block and a green block placed above the left and right sides of the base layer, respectively.\n  - The top layer features an orange triangular block on the left and a blue rectangular block on the right.\n- **Smaller Structure:**\n  - The base layer comprises four blue blocks arranged in a cross shape.\n  - The top layer is a single orange triangular block placed centrally above the base layer.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are as follows:\n- **Base Layer (Larger Structure):** Red block with a circular cutout (index 7), Yellow blocks (indices 3 and 8).\n- **Middle Layer (Larger Structure):** Blue block (index 5), Green block (index 6).\n- **Top Layer (Larger Structure):** Orange triangular block (index 11), Blue rectangular block (index 5).\n- **Base Layer (Smaller Structure):** Blue blocks (index 5).\n- **Top Layer (Smaller Structure):** Orange triangular block (index 11).\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 5\n   Step8: Move block with index 5\n   Step9: Move block with index 5\n   Step10: Move block with index 11\n}",

There are at least three distinct layers visible.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The base layer includes two red arches (blocks) and a yellow rectangular block.\n  - The middle layer has a combination of green, blue, and yellow blocks, with some placed on top of the arches and others forming a bridge-like structure.\n  - The top layer features an orange triangular block and a blue cube.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required to match the target structure:\n\n- Red Arch: Index 1\n- Yellow Rectangular Block: Index 9\n- Green Cube: Index 5\n- Blue Cube: Index 7\n- Orange Triangular Block: Index 15\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nThe assembly order is inferred as follows:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n}",

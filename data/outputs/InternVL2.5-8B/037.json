Main Target Image:\n   - Displays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   - Shows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2. Block Dictionary Image:\n   - Contains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   - Each sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n   - **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks arranged in 3 layers.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:** The blocks are stacked vertically. The top layer has 1 block, the middle layer has 2 blocks, and the bottom layer has 2 blocks. The blocks are arranged in a column, with the red block on top, followed by the blue block, then the green block, and finally the yellow block at the bottom.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n   - **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, the required blocks are:\n     - 1 red block\n     - 1 blue block\n     - 1 green block\n     - 1 green block\n     - 1 yellow block\n   - **List Block Indices:** The corresponding block indices are:\n     - Red block: Index 1\n     - Blue block: Index 2\n     - Green block: Index 3\n     - Green block: Index 3\n     - Yellow block: Index 5\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n   - **Inference of Order:** The assembly order is as follows:\n     - Step 1: Move block with index 1 (Red block)\n     - Step 2: Move block with index 2 (Blue block)\n     - Step 3: Move block with index 3 (Green block)\n     - Step 4: Move block with index 3 (Green block)\n     - Step 5: Move block with index 5 (Yellow block)\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n- **Detailed Analysis:** Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n- **Exact Matching:** Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the"

    "instruction": "<IMG_CONTEXT><IMG_CONTEXT>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

The middle layer with 3 blocks (1 red, 1 blue, 1 yellow).\n  3. The top layer with 2 blocks (1 blue, 1 yellow).\n\n#### Spatial Relationships:\n- The base layer has two green blocks standing vertically.\n- The middle layer has a red block on top of the green blocks, a blue block to the right of the red block, and a yellow block to the right of the blue block.\n- The top layer has a blue block on top of the red block and a yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\n#### Block Indices:\n- Green blocks (base layer): Index 5\n- Red block (middle layer): Index 2\n- Blue block (middle layer): Index 1\n- Yellow block (middle layer): Index 6\n- Blue block (top layer): Index 1\n- Yellow block (top layer): Index 6\n\n### Assembly Order\n\n```json\n{\n   \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n   \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n   \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n   \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n   \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n   \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n   \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n}\n```\n\n### Detailed Assembly Instructions\n\n1. **Step1**: Place the green block (index 5) vertically on the left side.\n2. **Step2**: Place the green block (index 5) vertically on the right side, next to the first green block.\n3. **Step3**: Place the red block (index 2) on top of the green blocks.\n4. **Step4**: Place the blue block (index 1) to the right of the red block.\n5. **Step5**: Place the yellow block (index 6) to the right of the blue block.\n6. **Step6**: Place the blue block (index 1) on top of the red block.\n7. **Step7**:"

    "instruction": "<IMG_CONTEXT><IMG_CONTEXT>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

    "predict": "### Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\n#### Count & Layers:\n- The structure consists of two main parts: a red cylindrical base with a green rectangular top, and a yellow rectangular base with green vertical supports.\n- The structure has two layers: the base layer (cylinders and rectangular base) and the top layer (rectangular blocks).\n\n#### Spatial Relationships:\n- The red cylindrical base supports the green rectangular top.\n- The yellow rectangular base supports two green vertical blocks.\n- The green rectangular top is placed on top of the red cylinders.\n- The green vertical blocks are placed on top of the yellow rectangular base.\n\n### Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\n#### Identify Needed Blocks:\n- Red Cylinders: 4 blocks\n- Green Rectangular Top: 4 blocks\n- Yellow Rectangular Base: 1 block\n- Green Vertical Blocks: 2 blocks\n\n#### List Block Indices:\n- Red Cylinders: Index 13\n- Green Rectangular Top: Index 1\n- Yellow Rectangular Base: Index 8\n- Green Vertical Blocks: Index 3\n\n### Determine the Assembly Order\n\n#### Assembly Instructions:\n```json\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 13 (red cylinder) to the base position.\n   Step2: Move block with index 13 (red cylinder) to the left of the first red cylinder.\n   Step3: Move block with index 13 (red cylinder) to the right of the first red cylinder.\n   Step4: Move block with index 13 (red cylinder) to the right of the second red cylinder.\n   Step5: Move block with index 1 (green rectangular top) on top of the red cylinders.\n   Step6: Move block with index 8 (yellow rectangular base) to the right of the red cylinders.\n   Step7: Move block with index 3 (green vertical block) on top of the yellow rectangular base.\n   Step8: Move block with index 3 (green vertical block) to the right of the first green vertical block.\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that the structure is built according to the main target image using the blocks from the dictionary."

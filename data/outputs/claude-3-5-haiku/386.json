Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure consists of 2 identical house-like buildings\n- Each building is 3 layers tall\n- Color layers from bottom to top:\n  1st layer: Red or Green\n  2nd layer: Green or Red\n  3rd layer (roof): Orange triangular block\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Block 3 (Red cube/rectangular block)\n- Block 5 or 6 (Green rectangular block, horizontal orientation)\n- Block 10 or 11 (Orange triangular roof block)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3 (Red block)\n   Step2: Move block with index 5 (Green block)\n   Step3: Move block with index 10 (Orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nRepeat the same sequence for the second building:\n{\n   Step4: Move block with index 3 (Red block)\n   Step5: Move block with index 5 (Green block)\n   Step6: Move block with index 10 (Orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe solution follows the exact blocks and orientations from the dictionary image.",

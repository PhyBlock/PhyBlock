Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure consists of 5 blocks:\n  * 2 yellow blocks (top and bottom)\n  * 2 green blocks (sides)\n  * 1 red block (center with circular cutout)\n- The structure is one layer tall\n- Blocks are arranged symmetrically around the red center block\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\n- Yellow blocks: Indices 13/14 and 15/16 (horizontal rectangular yellow blocks)\n- Green blocks: Indices 7/8 and 9/10 (horizontal/vertical green rectangular blocks)\n- Red block with circular cutout: Indices 1/2/5/6 (curved red blocks that can form the circular cutout)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7 (green block)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (green block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 (red curved block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 13 (yellow block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 15 (yellow block)\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure exactly as shown in the first image.",

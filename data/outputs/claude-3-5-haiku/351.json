Analyzing the Main Target Image:\n- The structure consists of 2 different block arrangements\n- Left structure (Design A):\n  * 6 blocks total\n  * 2 yellow horizontal blocks (top and bottom)\n  * 2 green vertical blocks\n  * 1 blue vertical block\n  * 1 red block in the center\n- Right structure (Design B):\n  * 6 blocks total\n  * Triangular/angled top in orange\n  * 3 stacked layers with alternating colors (green, blue, orange)\n\n2. Selecting Blocks from Dictionary:\nDesign A blocks needed:\n- Yellow horizontal blocks: Indices 9 and 12\n- Green vertical blocks: Indices 2 and 7\n- Blue vertical block: Index 5\n- Red center block: Index 4\n\nDesign B blocks needed:\n- Orange triangular top: Index 16\n- Orange square blocks: Indices 3 and 15\n- Blue square block: Index 5\n- Green square blocks: Indices 2 and 8\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2 (green)\n   Step2: Move block with index 5 (blue)\n   Step3: Move block with index 4 (red)\n   Step4: Move block with index 9 (yellow bottom)\n   Step5: Move block with index 7 (green)\n   Step6: Move block with index 12 (yellow top)\n\n   Step7: Move block with index 2 (green bottom)\n   Step8: Move block with index 5 (blue middle)\n   Step9: Move block with index 8 (green)\n   Step10: Move block with index 3 (orange)\n   Step11: Move block with index 15 (orange)\n   Step12: Move block with index 16 (orange top)\n}",

Bottom layer (red arch blocks): Blocks #1 and #2 from the dictionary\n2. Top layer (yellow block): Block #8 from the dictionary\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n}\n\nThe structure will be built by first placing the two red arch blocks side by side, then positioning the yellow rectangular block on top of them, matching the configuration in the target image exactly.",

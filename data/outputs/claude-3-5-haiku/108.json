Target Structure Analysis:\n- Total Blocks: 3 blocks\n- Colors: Yellow (curved), Green (cube), Blue (cube)\n- Arrangement: Yellow blocks at bottom, Green cube on left, Blue cube on right\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\n- Yellow curved block: Index 6\n- Green cube: Index 2\n- Blue cube: Index 1\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6 (yellow curved block)\n   Step2: Move block with index 2 (green cube)\n   Step3: Move block with index 1 (blue cube)\n}\n\nThe assembly order follows the bottom-to-top layering seen in the target image, with the yellow curved blocks forming the base, followed by the green and blue cubes positioned adjacent to each other.\n\nThis solution precisely matches the target structure using the exact blocks from the dictionary image, without any rotations or modifications.",

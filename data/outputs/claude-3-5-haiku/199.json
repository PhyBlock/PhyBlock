Analyze the Target Image:\n   - The structure has multiple layers and blocks\n   - Colors used: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange\n   - Consists of arched red blocks, blue cubes, green rectangular blocks, yellow blocks, and an orange block/wedge\n   - Total of 9 blocks used in the assembly\n\n2. Select Blocks from Dictionary:\n   Required blocks with their indices:\n   - Red arched block (index 1)\n   - Red arched block (index 2)\n   - Yellow rectangular block (index 7)\n   - Yellow rectangular block (index 8)\n   - Blue cube (index 3)\n   - Blue cube (index 3)\n   - Green rectangular block (index 5)\n   - Green rectangular block (index 6)\n   - Orange wedge (index 15)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 1\n      Step2: Move block with index 7\n      Step3: Move block with index 2\n      Step4: Move block with index 8\n      Step5: Move block with index 3\n      Step6: Move block with index 5\n      Step7: Move block with index 3\n      Step8: Move block with index 6\n      Step9: Move block with index 15\n   }\n\nThis sequence reconstructs the complex block structure exactly as shown in the target image.",

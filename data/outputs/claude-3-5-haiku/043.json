Target Structure Analysis:\n- The structure consists of 3 layers\n- Colors used: Red and Yellow\n- Central layer has a circular cutout\n- Yellow blocks form the top and bottom layers\n- Red blocks form the middle layer with a hole\n\n2. Required Blocks from Dictionary:\n- Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (Indices 9, 10 or 13, 14) for top and bottom layers\n- Red curved/cut-out blocks (Indices 1-8) for middle layer\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9 (yellow horizontal block)\n   Step2: Move block with index 5 (red curved block with hole)\n   Step3: Move block with index 11 (yellow vertical block)\n}\n\nThe structure is symmetrical, with a red middle block featuring a circular cutout, sandwiched between two yellow rectangular blocks positioned horizontally at the top and bottom. The assembly ensures the red block's hole is centered and aligned with the yellow blocks on either side.",

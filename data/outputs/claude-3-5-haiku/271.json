A complex multi-colored block with blue, orange, and green components\n  2. A red arch/curved block to the right\n\nBlock Dictionary Analysis:\n- I have blocks of different colors and shapes with indices 1-16\n- Relevant blocks for this structure appear to be:\n  * Block 1/2: Red arch/curved block ✓\n  * Block 10: Red triangular block ✓\n  * Block 4: Green cube ✓\n  * Block 7/8: Blue cube ✓\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7 (blue cube)\n  Step2: Move block with index 4 (green cube)\n  Step3: Move blocks 1 and 10 (red arch and red triangular block)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the visual positioning in the target image, with the blue and green cubes forming the center, surrounded by the orange/blue blocks, and the red arch positioned to the side.",

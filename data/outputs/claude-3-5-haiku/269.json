Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure consists of two separate block configurations\n- Left configuration:\n  * Blue vertical block at bottom\n  * Yellow curved block on top\n  * Red arch block at base\n- Right configuration:\n  * Green rectangular blocks\n  * Orange vertical and angled blocks\n  * Total of 8 blocks across both configurations\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Blue vertical cube (Index 3)\n- Yellow curved block (Index 9)\n- Red arch block (Index 1)\n- Green rectangular blocks (Index 4 and Index 6)\n- Orange vertical cylinder (Index 7)\n- Orange angled/triangular blocks (Index 12 and Index 15)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\nStep2: Move block with index 3 (blue cube) on top of red arch\nStep3: Move block with index 9 (yellow curved block) next to blue cube\nStep4: Move block with index 4 (green cube)\nStep5: Move block with index 6 (green vertical rectangle)\nStep6: Move block with index 7 (orange vertical cylinder)\nStep7: Move block with index 12 (orange angled block)\nStep8: Move block with index 15 (orange angled block)\n}",

Block 4 (Red curved block)\n2. Block 8 (Orange cylindrical block)\n3. Block 5 (Red L-shaped block)\n4. Block 6 (Blue cube)\n5. Block 7 (Green cube)\n6. Block 9 (Yellow curved/rounded block)\n7. Block 13, 14, 15, or 16 (Orange triangular blocks)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the spatial arrangement seen in the target image, using the exact blocks from the dictionary.",

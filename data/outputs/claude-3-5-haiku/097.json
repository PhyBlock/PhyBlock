Analyzing the Main Target Image:\n- Total Blocks: 6 blocks\n- Colors: Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow\n- Layers: 2 layers (bottom layer with 4 blocks, top layer with 2 blocks)\n\n2. Selecting Blocks from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks with their indices:\n- Red curve block (index 1)\n- Yellow cube block (index 4)\n- Blue cube block (index 3)\n- Green rectangular block (index 5)\n- Orange cylinder block (index 7)\n- Yellow curved block (index 8)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5 (green rectangular block)\n    Step2: Move block with index 3 (blue cube block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (yellow cube block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (red curve block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (yellow curved block)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the spatial arrangement seen in the target image, using the exact blocks from the dictionary.",

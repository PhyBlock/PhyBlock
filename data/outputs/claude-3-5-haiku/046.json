Main Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure is 4 layers tall\n- Colors used: Green, Yellow, Orange/Red\n- Layers from bottom to top:\n  * Bottom layer: 2 Orange/Red vertical cylinders on a Yellow base\n  * Second layer: 2 Green vertical blocks on a Yellow base\n  * Third layer: Another Yellow horizontal base\n  * Top layer: An Orange/Red triangular/pyramid block\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\n- Block 8: Orange/Red vertical cylinder\n- Block 9: Another Orange/Red vertical cylinder\n- Block 5: Yellow horizontal block\n- Block 6: Vertical Yellow block\n- Block 2: Green vertical block\n- Block 1: Smaller Green block\n- Block 12: Orange/Red triangular block\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 12\n}\n\nThis sequence should recreate the target structure exactly as shown in the first image.",

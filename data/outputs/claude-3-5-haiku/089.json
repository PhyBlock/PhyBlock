Main Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure is composed of orange cylindrical blocks and yellow rectangular/curved blocks\n- Structure has 2 layers\n- Bottom layer: 3 orange cylindrical blocks forming a base\n- Middle layer: 1 yellow rectangular block spanning the top of the orange cylinders\n- Top layer: 1 orange cylindrical block with a yellow curved/bent block on top\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks:\n- Yellow rectangular block (indices 1, 2, 5, 6)\n- Orange cylindrical block (indices 7, 8, 9)\n- Yellow curved/bent block (indices 10, 11)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder)\n    Step2: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder)\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (yellow rectangular block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 10 (yellow curved block)\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence matches the target structure precisely using blocks from the dictionary.",

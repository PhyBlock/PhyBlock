Main Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure consists of multiple blocks in different colors: orange, red, yellow, and blue\n- It has two main sections:\n   a) A vertical structure with orange cylindrical supports\n   b) A vehicle-like structure with cylindrical bases\n- The structure spans multiple layers, with blocks interconnected\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Orange cylinders (index 8 and 7)\n- Yellow rectangular block (index 5)\n- Yellow curved block (index 10)\n- Red curved block (index 1)\n- Blue cube (index 4)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder)\n    Step2: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder)\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 (red curved block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (yellow rectangular block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (yellow curved block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step7: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder, for the second structure)\n    Step8: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder)\n}\n\nThe instructions follow the exact arrangement seen in the target image, using blocks from the dictionary without any rotation.",

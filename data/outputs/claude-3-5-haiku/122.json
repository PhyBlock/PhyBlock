Block 12 (Orange cylinder)\n2. Block 6 or 7 (Green rectangular block)\n3. Block 4 (Red cubic block)\n4. Block 1 (Blue cubic block)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure by placing each block in the correct position and orientation, matching the original image exactly.",

Analyze the Main Target Image:\n   - The structure consists of 3 blocks total\n   - It has 3 layers:\n     * Bottom layer: Green rectangular block\n     * Middle layer: Orange cylindrical block\n     * Top layer: Green block (split into two parts)\n   - Blocks are vertically stacked and precisely centered\n\n2. Select Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   - Bottom block: Block 1 (green rectangular block)\n   - Middle block: Block 7 (orange vertical cylinder)\n   - Top block: Block 2 (green rectangular block with slight offset)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 1\n      Step2: Move block with index 7\n      Step3: Move block with index 2\n   }\n\nThe assembly follows a simple bottom-up approach, first placing the green base block, then the orange cylindrical block on top, and finally adding the second green block to complete the structure.",

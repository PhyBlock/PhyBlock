Analyzing the Main Target Image:\n- Structure consists of 3 blocks total\n- Colors: Green, Orange (cylindrical), Yellow\n- Layers: 3-layer structure\n- Spatial arrangement:\n  * Orange cylindrical block in center, extending full height\n  * Green blocks on left side, stacked vertically\n  * Yellow blocks on right side, placed horizontally across orange cylinder\n\n2. Selecting Blocks from Dictionary:\n- Green blocks (indices 1 & 2)\n- Orange cylindrical block (index 12)\n- Orange triangular top block (index 16)\n- Yellow blocks (indices 6 & 7)\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 12 (orange cylinder)\n   Step2: Move block with index 1 (green block bottom)\n   Step3: Move block with index 2 (green block top)\n   Step4: Move block with index 6 (yellow block)\n   Step5: Move block with index 7 (yellow block)\n   Step6: Move block with index 16 (orange triangular top)\n}\n\nThis sequence matches the structure shown in the target image, using blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.",

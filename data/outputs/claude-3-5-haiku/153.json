Target Image Analysis:\n- 2-layer structure\n- First layer: Red arch-shaped block with horizontal orientation\n- Second layer:\n  * Left side: Yellow block on red base\n  * Right side: Green block on orange base with an angular extension\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks by index:\n- Red arch block (Index 1)\n- Red arch block (Index 1)\n- Yellow rectangular block (Index 8)\n- Green rectangular block (Index 5)\n- Orange angular block (Index 15)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (Red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (Red arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 15 (Orange angular block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (Green rectangular block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 8 (Yellow rectangular block)\n}\n\nThe instructions recreate the complex 2-layer structure shown in the main target image, using blocks selected exactly as they appear in the dictionary, without any rotations.",

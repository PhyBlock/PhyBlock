Target Image Structure:\n- 5 total blocks\n- 3 layers high at the tallest point\n- Blocks from bottom to top:\n  * 2 orange cylindrical base blocks\n  * 1 yellow rectangular block on top of the cylinders\n  * 1 blue cubic block above the yellow block\n  * 1 orange triangular/prism block at the very top\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\n- Block 8: Orange cylinder\n- Block 6: Yellow rectangular block\n- Block 1: Blue cube\n- Block 10: Orange triangular prism\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder)\n    Step2: Move another block with index 8 (orange cylinder)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (yellow rectangular block) on top of the cylinders\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (blue cube) on top of the yellow block\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (orange triangular prism) on top of the blue cube\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure exactly as shown in the image.",

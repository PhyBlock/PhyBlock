Block 1 (Red arch)\n2. Block 6 (Red cube)\n3. Block 5 (Green cube)\n4. Block 10 (Green rectangular block)\n5. Block 12 (Yellow rectangular block)\n6. Block 8 (Blue cube)\n7. Block 16 (Orange triangular block)\n\nRight Structure:\n1. Block 5 (Green cube)\n2. Block 6 (Red cube)\n3. Block 12 (Yellow rectangular block)\n4. Block 8 (Blue cube)\n5. Block 10 (Green rectangular block)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n\nLeft Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nRight Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n}",

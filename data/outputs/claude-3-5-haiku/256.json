Analyze the Target Image:\n- Total blocks: 11 blocks\n- Colors used: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue\n- Layers: 2 main layers\n- Structure: An asymmetrical bridge-like construction with arch-like supports and blocks stacked on top\n\n2. Select Blocks from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks by index:\n- 2 (Red arch/bridge support)\n- 1 (Red arch/bridge support)\n- 10 (Red cube)\n- 5 (Red L-shaped block with curve)\n- 12 (Yellow rectangular block)\n- 15 (Yellow rectangular block)\n- 9 (Green cube)\n- 8 (Blue cube)\n- 13 (Yellow long rectangular block)\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n}\n\nThis sequence reconstructs the target structure using the exact blocks from the dictionary.",

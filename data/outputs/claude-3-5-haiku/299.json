Analyze the Main Target Image:\n- Two distinct block structures are shown\n- Left structure:\n  * 3 layers high\n  * Blue blocks on top\n  * Green block in middle\n  * Red blocks in base and middle\n  * Yellow blocks in base\n- Right structure:\n  * 2 layers high\n  * Blue block on top\n  * Yellow block in middle\n  * Orange cylindrical blocks as base\n\n2. Select Blocks from Dictionary:\nFor the left structure, I'll need:\n- 2x Blue cube blocks (Index 4)\n- 1x Green rectangular block (Index 7)\n- 2x Red blocks (one curved, Index 1; one cubic, Index 5)\n- 2x Yellow blocks (Index 8)\n\nFor the right structure, I'll need:\n- 1x Blue cube block (Index 4)\n- 1x Yellow rectangular block (Index 8)\n- 2x Orange cylindrical blocks (Index 10)\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5 (red cube)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (yellow rectangle)\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 (red curved block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 7 (green rectangle)\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 4 (second blue cube)\n    \n    Step7: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder)\n    Step8: Move block with index 10 (second orange cylinder)\n    Step9: Move block with index 8 (yellow rectangle)\n    Step10: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n}",

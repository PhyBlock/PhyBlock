Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure consists of 2 separate block assemblies\n- Left Assembly (3 layers):\n  * Bottom: Green and Blue cubes side by side\n  * Middle: Orange vertical cylinder\n  * Top: Red curved block\n- Right Assembly (3 layers):\n  * Bottom: 2 Orange triangular/wedge blocks\n  * Middle: Blue and Green cubes side by side\n  * Top: Red curved block forming an arch\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Green cube (index 5)\n- Blue cube (index 4)\n- Orange vertical cylinder (index 11)\n- Red curved block (index 1)\n- Orange triangular/wedge blocks (indices 13, 14)\n- Another Green cube (index 5)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 5 (Green cube)\nStep2: Move block with index 4 (Blue cube)\nStep3: Move block with index 11 (Orange cylinder)\nStep4: Move block with index 1 (Red curved block)\nStep5: Move block with index 13 (Orange triangular block)\nStep6: Move block with index 14 (Orange triangular block)\nStep7: Move block with index 5 (Green cube)\nStep8: Move block with index 4 (Blue cube)\nStep9: Move block with index 1 (Red curved block)\n}",

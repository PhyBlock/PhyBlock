Target Image Analysis:\n- Total Blocks: 7 blocks\n- Layers: 3 layers\n- Colors (from bottom to top): Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Orange\n- Structure: Appears to be a house-like or robot-like configuration\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nI'll list the block indices needed in order from bottom to top:\n- Bottom Layer (Blue): Block 5 and Block 6 (two vertical blue blocks)\n- Middle Layer (Yellow): Block 10 (horizontal yellow block)\n- Middle Layer (Red): Block 12 (vertical red block)\n- Middle Layer (Green): Block 8 (horizontal green block)\n- Top Layer (Orange): Block 15 and Block 16 (triangular orange blocks forming a roof)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the visual structure of the target image, using only blocks from the dictionary without any rotation.",

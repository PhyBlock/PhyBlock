Analyze Target Image Structure:\n- Total blocks: 7\n- Layers: 3 vertical layers\n- Composition:\n  * Base: Two orange cylindrical blocks\n  * Middle Layer: Green rectangular block\n  * Top Layer: Blue and red square blocks, with green rectangular block underneath\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Two (2) of index 8 (orange cylinder)\n- One (1) of index 4 (green rectangular block)\n- One (1) of index 1 (blue square block)\n- One (1) of index 2 (red square block)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder) next to first cylinder\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (green rectangular block) on top of cylinders\n    Step4: Move block with index 2 (red square block) on top of green block\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (blue square block) on top of red block\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the spatial arrangement seen in the target image, using the exact blocks from the dictionary.",

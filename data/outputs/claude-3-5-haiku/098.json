Top Layer (Yellow): Block 10 and 11 (curved yellow blocks)\n2. Middle Layer (Red): Block 4 (curved red block)\n3. Vertical Support (Orange): Block 8 (vertical orange cylinder)\n4. Side Blocks (Orange): Blocks 13 and 14 (angular orange blocks)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 4 on top of block 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 13 next to block 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 14 on the opposite side of block 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 on top of block 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 11 next to block 10\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure exactly as shown in the first image.",

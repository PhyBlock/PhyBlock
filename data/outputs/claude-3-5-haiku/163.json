Analyze Target Image:\n- Total Blocks: 9 blocks\n- Colors: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Orange\n- Layers: Multiple layers with complex arrangements\n- Structure includes arched base blocks, vertical stacks, and angled/triangular blocks\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Red arch block (1)\n- Blue cube block (2)\n- Green cube block (3 and 5)\n- Yellow rectangular block (6 and 7)\n- Orange triangular block (15)\n- Orange cylindrical block (9)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 14 (red cube)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (yellow rectangular)\n    Step4: Move block with index 3 (green cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 5 (green cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 2 (blue cube)\n    Step7: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular)\n    Step8: Move block with index 9 (orange cylindrical)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the spatial arrangement in the target image, carefully matching block colors, shapes, and orientations from the dictionary image.",

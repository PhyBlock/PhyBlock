Bottom Layer (from left to right):\n- Block 13 (small orange triangle)\n- Block 9 (yellow cube)\n- Block 10 (small red triangular piece)\n- Block 11 (orange triangular piece)\n- Block 12 (orange triangular piece)\n\n2. Middle Layer:\n- Block 5 (red curved piece with hole)\n- Block 6 (blue cube)\n- Block 7 (green cube)\n\n3. Top Layer:\n- Block 15 (small orange triangular piece)\n- Block 8 (orange cube)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block 13\n    Step2: Move block 9\n    Step3: Move block 10\n    Step4: Move block 11\n    Step5: Move block 12\n    Step6: Move block 5\n    Step7: Move block 6\n    Step8: Move block 7\n    Step9: Move block 15\n    Step10: Move block 8\n}\n\nThe structure is systematically built from bottom to top, ensuring each block is placed in its precise location as shown in the target image.",

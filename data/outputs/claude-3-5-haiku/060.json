Main Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure is 3 layers tall\n- Colors used: Red and Yellow\n- Composition:\n  * Bottom layer: Two red arch-shaped blocks\n  * Middle layer: A red block with a circular cutout, and a yellow rectangular block\n  * Top layer: A yellow rectangular block\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\n- Red arch blocks: Block indices 1 and 2\n- Red block with circular cutout: Block indices 5 and 6\n- Yellow rectangular blocks: Block indices 9, 10, 11, and 12\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n   Step2: Move block with index 2 (red arch)\n   Step3: Move block with index 5 (red block with circular cutout)\n   Step4: Move block with index 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n   Step5: Move block with index 11 (yellow rectangular block)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows a bottom-up approach, creating a stable structure that matches the target image precisely using the blocks from the dictionary.",

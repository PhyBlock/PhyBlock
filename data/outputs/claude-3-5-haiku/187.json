Main Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure consists of 3 layers\n- First (bottom) layer: Yellow rectangular blocks as base\n- Second (middle) layer: Green rectangular/cuboid blocks\n- Top layer: Orange triangular blocks\n- Two different structures are shown\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\nRequired blocks by index:\n- Yellow rectangular block (index 5, 6, or 8)\n- Green rectangular block (index 1, 2, or 3)\n- Orange triangular block (index 13, 14, 15, or 16)\n- Orange cylindrical block (index 10)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5 (yellow rectangular base)\n   Step2: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder)\n   Step3: Move block with index 2 (green rectangular block)\n   Step4: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular block)\n}\n\nThis sequence matches the spatial arrangement and colors of the structures in the main target image, using blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.",

Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure consists of two main sections\n- Left section (tall structure):\n  * Composed of 5 blocks\n  * Includes a red cylindrical block, green rectangular blocks, yellow rectangular blocks, and a small red triangular block\n  * Multi-layered with complex intersections\n\n- Right section (lower structure):\n  * Composed of 6 blocks\n  * Includes red arch blocks, yellow semi-circular blocks, a blue cubic block, green and yellow rectangular blocks, and an orange cubic block\n  * Built in two layers\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nI'll list the block indices needed in order:\n- Block 1 (red arch/curved block)\n- Block 2 (red curved block)\n- Block 4 (blue cube)\n- Block 5 (orange cube)\n- Block 6 (yellow cube)\n- Block 7 (green rectangular block)\n- Block 8 (green rectangular block)\n- Block 9 (green rectangular block)\n- Block 11 (yellow vertical rectangular block)\n- Block 12 (yellow horizontal rectangular block)\n- Block 13 (red cylinder)\n- Block 14 (yellow semi-circular block)\n- Block 15 (yellow rectangular block)\n- Block 16 (red triangular block)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 16\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 6\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 9\n    Step13: Move block with index 2\n    Step14: Move block with index 15\n}",

Analysis of Main Target Image:\n- The structure consists of 4 blocks\n- Colors used: Green (top and bottom layers), Yellow (middle layers), Red (interior)\n- Layers: 3 layers total\n- Structure is vertically stacked with blocks positioned to create an offset/asymmetric design\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nBased on the colors and orientations, I'll select these blocks:\n- Green block #2 (for bottom layer)\n- Yellow block #11 (for lower middle layer)\n- Red block #4 (for interior)\n- Green block #8 (for top layer)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the vertical layering seen in the target image, starting from the bottom green block, then adding the yellow block, inserting the red block, and finally capping with the top green block.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the analysis or instructions?",

Red arch block at bottom\n  2. Green block on top of red arch\n  3. Blue cube on top of green block\n  4. Orange triangular block at the top\n- Right structure (3 layers):\n  1. Yellow block at bottom\n  2. Green blocks on sides\n  3. Red block with circular cutout in center\n\nBlock Dictionary Selection:\nBased on the target image, I'll select the following block indices:\n1. Red arch block (index 1)\n2. Green rectangular block (index 9)\n3. Blue cube block (index 5)\n4. Orange triangular block (index 14)\n5. Yellow rectangular block (index 11)\n6. Green side blocks (indices 7 and 10)\n7. Red block with circular cutout (appears to be a custom configuration)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (green block) on top of red arch\n    Step3: Move block with index 5 (blue cube) on top of green block\n    Step4: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle) on top of blue cube\n    Step5: Move block with index 11 (yellow block) as base for right structure\n    Step6: Move block with index 7 (green block) on left side\n    Step7: Move block with index 10 (green block) on right side\n    Step8: Place red block with circular cutout in center\n}",

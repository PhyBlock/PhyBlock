Block 1 (Red curved base, left side)\n2. Block 4 (Red curved base, right side)\n3. Block 9 (Orange vertical cylinder)\n4. Block 5 (Blue cube)\n5. Block 6 (Green cube)\n6. Block 7 (Yellow cube)\n7. Block 12 (Yellow curved top piece)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n}\n\nThis sequence should recreate the structure shown in the main target image using the exact blocks from the dictionary.",

Analyzing the Main Target Image:\n- The structure consists of 4 blocks in total\n- There are 3 layers in the structure\n- Blocks are stacked as follows from bottom to top:\n  * Bottom layer: Orange cylindrical blocks (2 side by side)\n  * Middle layer: A green rectangular block\n  * Top layer: A red rectangular block and a blue rectangular block\n\n2. Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:\nThe required blocks are:\n- Block 8 (Orange cylinder)\n- Block 4 (Green rectangular block)\n- Block 2 (Red rectangular block)\n- Block 1 (Blue rectangular block)\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure exactly as shown in the first image, using the blocks from the dictionary in their original orientations.",

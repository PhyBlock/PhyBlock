Red Arch Block (Index 1): Used as base foundation\n2. Green Rectangular Block (Index 7): Vertical support\n3. Yellow Rectangular Block (Index 9): Horizontal support\n4. Blue Cube Block (Index 5): Small support block\n5. Orange Triangular Block (Index 15): Top apex block\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (Red Arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (Red Arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (Green Rectangular)\n    Step4: Move block with index 9 (Yellow Rectangular)\n    Step5: Move block with index 5 (Blue Cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 7 (Green Rectangular)\n    Step7: Move block with index 9 (Yellow Rectangular)\n    Step8: Move block with index 15 (Orange Triangular)\n}\n\nThis solution precisely matches the target structure using blocks from the provided dictionary.",

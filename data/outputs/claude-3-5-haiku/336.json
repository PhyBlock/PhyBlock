Red arch blocks (index 1, 2, 3, 4): Need multiple rotations to create the arch\n2. Blue cube block (index 5)\n3. Green rectangular block (index 6)\n4. Yellow rectangular block (index 8 or 10)\n5. Orange cylindrical blocks (index 11, 12)\n6. Orange triangular block (index 15)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (green rectangular)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (blue cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (red arch)\n    Step6: Move block with index 15 (orange triangle)\n    Step7: Move block with index 8 (yellow rectangular)\n    Step8: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder)\n    Step9: Move block with index 12 (orange cylinder)\n}",

Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Total Blocks: 6 blocks\n- Colors: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Orange (peak block)\n- Layers: 2 layers\n- Structure: Appears to be a multi-colored rectangular/cubic composition with an orange triangular/peaked block on top\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\nRequired blocks with their indices:\n- Blue cube (index 6)\n- Red curved block (index 5)\n- Green cube (index 7)\n- Yellow rectangular block (index 9 or 11)\n- Orange small cube (index 13)\n- Orange peaked/triangular block (index 15)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6 (blue cube)\n    Step2: Move block with index 5 (red curved block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (green cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 13 (orange small cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 15 (orange peaked block)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the structure seen in the main target image, using the exact blocks from the dictionary without rotation.",

Analyzing the Main Target Image:\n- The structure consists of 4 blocks:\n  * 2 orange cylindrical blocks at the bottom\n  * 1 yellow rectangular block connecting the bottom blocks\n  * 1 orange block with a sloped top at the uppermost layer\n\n2. Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:\n- Bottom left cylinder: Block #5\n- Bottom right cylinder: Block #5\n- Yellow horizontal block: Block #1\n- Orange sloped top block: Block #12\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 1 (connecting the two cylinders)\n   Step4: Move block with index 12 (placed on top)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the structure in the target image, using blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary, maintaining their original orientation and position.",

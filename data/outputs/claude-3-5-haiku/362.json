Analyzing the Main Target Image:\n- Total blocks: 9 blocks\n- Layers: 3 layers\n- Colors used: Orange (cylindrical and triangular), Yellow, Green, Blue\n- Unique structure with cylindrical supports and rectangular/triangular blocks\n\n2. Selecting Blocks from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks by index:\n- Blue block (index 1): 1 piece\n- Green blocks (index 3 and 5): 2 pieces\n- Yellow blocks (index 6 and 8): 2 pieces\n- Orange cylindrical blocks (index 10): 2 pieces\n- Orange triangular blocks (index 14): 2 pieces\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3 (green base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder) on top of green base\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (yellow block) next to first orange cylinder\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (green block) on the other side of yellow block\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (second orange cylinder) on green block\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (yellow block) next to second orange cylinder\n    Step7: Move block with index 1 (blue block) on top of yellow block\n    Step8: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular block) on yellow block\n    Step9: Move second block with index 14 (orange triangular block) on other structure\n}",

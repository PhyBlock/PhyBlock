Left side: Smaller structure with triangular orange roof-like pieces\n  2. Right side: Taller, more vertical structure\n\nBlock Dictionary Analysis:\n- Green Blocks: Rectangular blocks in various orientations (vertical and horizontal)\n- Orange Blocks: Triangular and cylindrical shapes in different orientations\n\nRequired Blocks (by index):\n- Green blocks: 1, 2\n- Orange blocks: 9, 10, 6\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (green horizontal block)\n    Step2: Move block with index 2 (green vertical block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 9 (orange rectangular block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 10 (orange angled block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 6 (orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 2 (additional green vertical block)\n}\n\nThis sequence should recreate the target structure with the specified blocks from the dictionary.",

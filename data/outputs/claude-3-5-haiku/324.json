Green cube (index 3)\n2. Blue cube (index 2) - 4 of these\n3. Orange triangular prisms (index 13, 14, 15, 16)\n4. Red block (index 1)\n5. Green block (index 6)\n6. Yellow block (index 7)\n7. Orange cylinder (index 9)\n8. Orange triangular segment (index 12)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3 (green cube)\n    Step2: Move block with index 2 (blue cube) on 4 sides of green cube\n    Step3: Move blocks with index 13/14/15/16 (orange triangular prisms) around blue cubes\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (red block) as base for right structure\n    Step5: Move block with index 6 (green block) on red block\n    Step6: Move block with index 7 (yellow block) on green block\n    Step7: Move block with index 12 (orange triangular segment)\n    Step8: Move block with index 9 (orange cylinder) on top\n}",

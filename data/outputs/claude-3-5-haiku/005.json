Main Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure is composed of 4 blocks\n- It has 2 layers\n- Red and orange/reddish colors are used\n- Bottom layer is an arch-like block with two supporting sides\n- Top layer consists of two triangular/angled blocks\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nFor this structure, I'll need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n- Block #1 (arch/curved base block) - 2 copies\n- Block #10 (cube/rectangular block)\n- Block #11 and/or #15 (angled/triangular top blocks)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block #1 (left arch support)\n    Step2: Move block #1 (right arch support)\n    Step3: Move block #10 (center rectangular block)\n    Step4: Move block #11 (top left angled block)\n    Step5: Move block #15 (top right angled block)\n}\n\nThe final structure matches the original image, using blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary without any rotations.",

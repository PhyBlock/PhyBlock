Analyze the Main Target Image:\n- Total blocks: 15 blocks\n- Layers: 3 layers\n- Colors used: Red, Orange, Blue, Green, Yellow\n- Unique structure with curved/circular cutouts on red blocks\n- Complex asymmetrical design with varying block orientations\n\n2. Select Required Blocks from Dictionary:\nBased on the target image, here are the block indices needed:\n\nRed Blocks (curved/arch): 1, 2\nBlue Blocks (cube): 4\nGreen Blocks (cube/rectangular): 5, 7, 8\nYellow Blocks (rectangular): 6, 10, 12\nOrange Blocks (triangular/wedge): 13, 14, 15, 16\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12 (yellow rectangular)\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 (yellow cube)\n    Step3: Move block with index 10 (yellow rectangular)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (green cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 7 (green block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (green block)\n    Step7: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step8: Move block with index 1 (red curved block)\n    Step9: Move block with index 2 (red curved/L-shaped block)\n    Step10: Move block with index 13 (orange block)\n    Step11: Move block with index 14 (orange block)\n    Step12: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular block)\n    Step13: Move block with index 16 (orange triangular block)\n}",

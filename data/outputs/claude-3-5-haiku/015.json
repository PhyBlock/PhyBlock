Bottom layer: 2 blue blocks side by side\n  2. Middle layer: 1 yellow block spanning across the blue blocks\n  3. Top layer: 1 red block with an arch, sitting on the yellow block\n  4. Another red triangular block at the top\n\nBlock Dictionary Selection:\nRequired blocks with their indices:\n1. Blue blocks (bottom layer): Block 7 and Block 7\n2. Yellow block (middle layer): Block 9\n3. Red arched block (middle/top): Block 1\n4. Red triangular block (top): Block 13\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 9 (on top of blue blocks)\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (with arch, on top of yellow block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 13 (at the very top)\n}\n\nThis sequence matches the structure in the main target image exactly.",

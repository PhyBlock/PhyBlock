Red Arch Blocks (Index 1 or 2): Two red arch blocks for the base\n2. Yellow Blocks (Index 11 or 13): Two tall yellow rectangular blocks\n3. Green Blocks (Index 9): One green rectangular block\n4. Blue Block (Index 5): One blue cubic block\n5. Orange Block (Index 6): One orange cubic block\n6. Yellow Curved Block (Index 14): One yellow curved/rounded block\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (Red Arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (Red Arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (Orange Cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 9 (Green Rectangle)\n    Step5: Move block with index 5 (Blue Cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 11 (Yellow Rectangle)\n    Step7: Move block with index 11 (Yellow Rectangle)\n    Step8: Move block with index 14 (Yellow Curved)\n}\n\nThis solution matches the target image's structure, block types, colors, and spatial arrangement.",

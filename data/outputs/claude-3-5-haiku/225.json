Red arch block (index 1 or 2) - base\n2. Yellow rectangular block (index 15) - middle horizontal layer\n3. Yellow cube block (index 11) - top left\n4. Blue cube block (index 7) - top right\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (another red arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 15 (yellow rectangular block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 11 (yellow cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 7 (blue cube)\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure exactly, using blocks from the dictionary with their precise orientations and colors.",

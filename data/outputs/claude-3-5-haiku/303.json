Analysis of Main Target Image:\n- Two structures are present\n- Left structure (Tower 1):\n  * 6 blocks total\n  * 4 layers high\n  * Colors from bottom: Blue, Orange, Green, Red\n- Right structure (Tower 2):\n  * 6 blocks total\n  * 4 layers high\n  * Different arrangement, includes a triangular top piece\n  * Colors from bottom: Blue, Orange, Green, Orange (top triangular)\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\nRequired blocks with their indices:\n- Blue cube (index 1)\n- Orange cube (index 3)\n- Green cube (index 2)\n- Yellow cube (index 5)\n- Orange triangular block (index 15)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (Blue)\n    Step2: Move block with index 3 (Orange)\n    Step3: Move block with index 2 (Green)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (Yellow)\n    Step5: Move block with index 3 (Orange)\n    Step6: Move block with index 2 (Green)\n    Step7: Move block with index 15 (Orange triangular)\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the structures seen in the main image.",

Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Total Blocks: 9 blocks\n- Colors: Red, Green, Yellow, Orange\n- Layers: 2 layers\n- Structure: \n  * Bottom layer: Red arch/bridge blocks (2 blocks)\n  * Top layer: Mixed green and yellow rectangular blocks\n  * Left side: Orange cylindrical block on green block\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- 2x Block 1 (Red arch/bridge)\n- 3x Block 5 (Green rectangular)\n- 3x Block 7 (Yellow vertical rectangular)\n- 1x Block 10 (Orange vertical cylinder)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 5\n    Step8: Move block with index 10 on top of block with index 5\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure exactly as shown in the main image.",

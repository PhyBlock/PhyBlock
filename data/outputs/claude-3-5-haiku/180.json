Orange cylinders (indices 11 and 12)\n  2. Green rectangular block (index 5)\n  3. Red rectangular block (index 4)\n  4. Blue cube (index 3)\n  5. Orange triangular block (index 15)\n\n- For second structure:\n  1. Yellow rectangular blocks (indices 8 and 9)\n  2. Orange cylinders (indices 10)\n  3. Red arch block (index 1)\n  4. Red triangular block (index 16)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 11\n  Step2: Move block with index 12\n  Step3: Move block with index 5\n  Step4: Move block with index 4\n  Step5: Move block with index 3\n  Step6: Move block with index 15\n  Step7: Move block with index 9\n  Step8: Move block with index 8\n  Step9: Move block with index 10\n  Step10: Move block with index 1\n  Step11: Move block with index 16\n}",

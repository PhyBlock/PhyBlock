Analyzing the Target Image:\n- The structure consists of 9 blocks total\n- Colors used: Red, Green, Yellow, Orange\n- Structure has multiple layers:\n  * Bottom layer: Green blocks\n  * Middle layer: Red arch blocks and yellow block\n  * Top layer: Orange triangular blocks\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Green vertical blocks (index 7/8)\n- Red arch blocks (index 1/2)\n- Yellow horizontal block (index 11)\n- Orange triangular blocks (index 15/16)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7 (green vertical)\n   Step2: Move block with index 8 (green vertical)\n   Step3: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n   Step4: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n   Step5: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal)\n   Step6: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular)\n   Step7: Move block with index 16 (orange triangular)\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure using the exact blocks from the dictionary image.",

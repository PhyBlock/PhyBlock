Analyzing the Main Target Image:\n- The structure consists of 5 blocks\n- Layers: 3 layers high\n- Colors: Green (center column), Orange (sides)\n- Configuration: A vertical green column in the center, with orange blocks on the sides\n\n2. Selecting Blocks from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks:\n- 2 (Green cube)\n- 3 (Orange cube)\n- 10 (Orange triangular block)\n- 11 (Orange triangular block)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure by placing the orange cubes at the base and side, the green cubes vertically in the center, and the orange triangular blocks to complete the structure.\n\nThe assembly follows the visual layout of the target image, ensuring each block is placed in its correct position and orientation.",

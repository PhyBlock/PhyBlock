Block 1 (Red curved arch) - Used twice for bottom layer\n2. Block 2 (Red curved arch) - Used once in middle layer\n3. Block 4 (Yellow rectangular block) - Used twice for middle and top layers\n4. Block 12 (Orange triangular block) - Used once on top\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (Red curved arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (Red curved arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (Yellow rectangular block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 2 (Red curved arch)\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (Yellow rectangular block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 12 (Orange triangular block)\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the structure exactly as shown in the main target image.",

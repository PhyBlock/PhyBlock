Index 1 (Red arch block) - used multiple times for base\n2. Index 6 (Blue cube)\n3. Index 7 (Orange cube)\n4. Index 8 (Green rectangular block)\n5. Index 9 (Yellow rectangular block) - used multiple times\n6. Index 14 (Yellow curved block)\n7. Index 15 (Orange angled block)\n8. Index 16 (Orange small angled block)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (Red arch block)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (Red arch block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 (Red arch block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 7 (Orange cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 14 (Yellow curved block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 9 (Yellow rectangular block)\n    Step7: Move block with index 6 (Blue cube)\n    Step8: Move block with index 8 (Green rectangular block)\n    Step9: Move block with index 9 (Yellow rectangular block)\n    Step10: Move block with index 15 (Orange angled block)\n    Step11: Move block with index 16 (Orange small angled block)\n    Step12: Move block with index 1 (Red arch block with peaked top)\n}\n\nThis solution matches the target image exactly, using blocks from the dictionary in their original orientations.",

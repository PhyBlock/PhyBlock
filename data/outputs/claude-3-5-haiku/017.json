Green vertical blocks (bottom layer): Indices 5 and 6\n2. Yellow horizontal block (middle layer): Index 8\n3. Red block with triangular top (top layer): Index 2\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5 (green vertical block)\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 (green vertical block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 2 (red block with triangular top)\n}\n\nKey Observations:\n- Blocks are placed precisely as they appear in the dictionary\n- No rotations were needed\n- Blocks are stacked in a specific order from bottom to top\n- The structure forms an architectural-like design with an arch and peaked roof",

Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Two identical structures composed of colored blocks\n- Each structure has 3 layers\n- Red curved blocks at top and bottom\n- Middle layers include:\n  * Blue square block\n  * Green rectangular block\n  * Yellow square block\n- Structure is symmetrical\n\n2. Block Dictionary Identification:\nRequired blocks:\n- Red curved blocks (indices 1, 2, 3, 4)\n- Blue cube block (index 7)\n- Green rectangular block (index 12 or 16)\n- Yellow cube block (index 11)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red curved block)\n    Step2: Move block with index 12 (green rectangular block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (blue cube block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 11 (yellow cube block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (red curved block)\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure using exact blocks from the dictionary, following the layering and positioning shown in the main image.",

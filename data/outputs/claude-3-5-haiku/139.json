Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Total blocks: 6 blocks\n- Layers: 3 layers\n- Colors used: Red (arch/base), Green (middle layer), Yellow (middle layer), Orange (top cylinder and roof)\n- Structure: A complex assembly with arched red base, green and yellow middle layers, and an orange vertical cylinder topped with a roof\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- 1: Red arch block (base)\n- 5: Green rectangular block\n- 7: Green vertical rectangular block\n- 8: Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n- 10: Orange vertical cylinder\n- 15: Orange roof/triangular block\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 5 (green horizontal rectangle)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (green vertical rectangle)\n    Step4: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal rectangle)\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 15 (orange roof/triangle)\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure exactly as shown in the main image.",

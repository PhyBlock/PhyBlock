Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Total blocks: 13 blocks\n- Colors: Red, Blue, Yellow, Green\n- Layers: 3-4 layers tall\n- Two distinct structures side by side\n- Left structure is taller and more complex\n- Right structure has more varied block sizes\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\nRequired blocks (indices):\n- 1 (Red arch/curved block)\n- 2 (Red arch/curved block)\n- 4 (Blue cube)\n- 5 (Yellow small cube)\n- 6 (Green rectangular block)\n- 8 (Yellow tall rectangular block)\n- 9 (Red tall cylindrical block)\n- 10 (Yellow half-cylindrical block)\n- 12 (Red block segment)\n- 14 (Orange angled block)\n- 15 (Orange angled block)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 9 (Red tall cylindrical block)\nStep2: Move block with index 5 (Yellow small cube)\nStep3: Move block with index 8 (Yellow tall rectangular block)\nStep4: Move block with index 4 (Blue cube)\nStep5: Move block with index 1 (Red arch/curved block)\nStep6: Move block with index 10 (Yellow half-cylindrical block)\nStep7: Move block with index 6 (Green rectangular block)\nStep8: Move block with index 12 (Red block segment)\nStep9: Move block with index 14 (Orange angled block)\nStep10: Move block with index 15 (Orange angled block)\n}",

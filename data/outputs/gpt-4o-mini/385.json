Red Block (Index **1**)\n2. Red Block (Index **2**)\n3. Yellow Block (Index **9**)\n4. Green Block (Index **6**)\n5. Orange Cylinder (Index **10**)\n6. Yellow Half-Cylinder (Index **12**)\n\n### List of Block Indices:\n- 1: Red Block\n- 2: Red Block\n- 9: Yellow Block\n- 6: Green Block\n- 10: Orange Cylinder\n- 12: Yellow Half-Cylinder\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nUsing the selected blocks, the assembly sequence is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n}\n``` \n\nThis completes the assembly of the structure as seen in the main target image using the specified blocks.",

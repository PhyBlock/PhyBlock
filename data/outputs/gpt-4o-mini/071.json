Red arched block (index 1) - 2x\n  - 2. Green rectangular block (index 6) - 2x\n  - 3. Yellow rectangular block (index 9) - 2x\n  - 4. Red rectangular block (index 5) - 2x\n  - 5. Yellow rectangular block (index 8) - 1x\n  - 6. Red triangular block (index 16) - 1x\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nGiven the configuration described, the assembly order will be as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n   Step9: Move block with index 16\n   Step10: Move block with index 9\n}\n``` \n\nThis sequence outlines how to stack and place each block to replicate the main target image accurately.",

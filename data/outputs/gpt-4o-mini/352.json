Blue cube: **Index 1**\n2. Yellow rectangular block: **Index 6**\n3. Orange cylindrical block: **Index 8**\n4. Yellow rectangular block (as base for the upper layer): **Index 5**\n5. Orange roof-shaped block: **Index 13** (used twice for the tower)\n\n### List of Block Indices\n\n- Needed Blocks: \n  - Block Index 1 (Blue cube)\n  - Block Index 5 (Yellow block)\n  - Block Index 6 (Yellow block)\n  - Block Index 8 (Orange cylinder)\n  - Block Index 13 (Orange roof, used twice)\n\n### Assembly Order\n\n```plaintext\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 13\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n}\n``` \n\nThis sequence provides a clear methodology to reconstruct the desired structure.",

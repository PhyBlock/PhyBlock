Red arch block (index 1)\n2. Red arch block (index 2)\n3. Yellow rectangular block (index 3)\n4. Red square block (index 11)\n5. Orange triangular block (index 16)\n\n### Block Indices List\n- Block Indices: [1, 2, 3, 11, 16]\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nBased on the selected blocks, the assembly instructions are as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 16\n}\n```",

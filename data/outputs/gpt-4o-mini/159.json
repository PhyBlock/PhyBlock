Index 2 (Green Block) - for both structures\n2. Index 3 (Red Block) - for the vehicle\n3. Index 1 (Blue Block) - for the vehicle (top)\n4. Index 5 (Blue Block) - for the vehicle (middle)\n5. Index 9 (Orange Cylinder) - for the vehicle (wheels)\n6. Index 12 (Orange Rectilinear Block) - for the right structure (4x)\n7. Index 15 (Blue Rectilinear Block) - for the right structure (additional surrounds)\n\n### Assembly Instructions:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n    Step11: Move block with index 15\n    Step12: Move block with index 12\n    Step13: Move block with index 2\n}\n``` \n\nThis sequence effectively assembles both the vehicle and the cross-like structure according to the analysis of the main target image.",

The left structure (arch and roof) is stacked higher than the right structure (a simple tower).\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**:\n   - **Left Structure**:\n     - The bottom layer has two red blocks placed horizontally (indices likely 1 and 4).\n     - A yellow block (index 9) rests horizontally on top of the two red blocks.\n     - Above the yellow block, there are two red blocks (indices likely 1 and 4) forming a roof with an arch beneath.\n   - **Right Structure**:\n     - The bottom layer consists of two green blocks (index 7) stacked vertically.\n     - An orange triangular roof (index 13) is placed atop the green blocks.\n     - Additionally, the structure has a side orange piece (index 15) on one side.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks\n\nBased on the main target image, the following blocks from the block dictionary are required:\n\n1. For the left structure:\n   - Arch Blocks (index 1) - 2 needed\n   - Yellow Block (index 9) - 1 needed\n   - Roof Block (index 13) - 1 needed\n\n2. For the right structure:\n   - Green Block (index 7) - 2 needed\n   - Orange Roof (index 13) - 1 needed\n   - Side Orange Piece (index 15) - 1 needed\n\n### List of Block Indices\n\n- **Left Structure**:\n  - Block Indices: 1, 1, 9, 13 \n- **Right Structure**: \n  - Block Indices: 7, 7, 13, 15\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nBased on the selected blocks, the assembly order is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 13\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 13\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n}\n``` \n\nThis sequence provides a clear step-by-step guide for building the structure as depicted in the target image using the selected building blocks.",

The left structure has two layers, while the right structure has one layer on top of another.\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships:**\n   - **Left Structure:**\n     - Bottom layer: contains two red semi-circular blocks (indices 1 and 3).\n     - Middle layer: consists of a blue block (index 5) and two green blocks (indices 7 and 9) placed horizontally.\n     - Top layer: has an orange pyramid-shaped block (index 16).\n  \n   - **Right Structure:**\n     - Bottom layer: contains a green block (index 9) and two layers consisting of a yellow block (index 10) on top of two green blocks (index 9).\n     - Top layer: features a red cylindrical block (index 12).\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Left Structure:**\n  - **Indices:**\n    - 1 (Red semi-circular block)\n    - 5 (Blue block)\n    - 7 (Green block)\n    - 9 (Green block)\n    - 3 (Red semi-circular block)\n    - 16 (Orange pyramid-shaped block)\n\n- **Right Structure:**\n  - **Indices:**\n    - 9 (Green block)\n    - 10 (Yellow block)\n    - 12 (Red cylindrical block)\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n``` \n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 16\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n   Step9: Move block with index 12\n}\n``` \n\nThis sequence satisfies the requirements of building the structures as depicted in the target image utilizing the identified blocks from the dictionary without any rotation.",

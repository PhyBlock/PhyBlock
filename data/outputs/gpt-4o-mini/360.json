Yellow Block: 9\n2. Blue Block: 1 (used twice)\n3. Red Block: 2\n4. Green Block: 6\n5. Blue Block: 5\n6. Orange Block: 12 (used twice)\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nThe assembly process, following a logical sequence, is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 12\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 1\n   Step10: Move block with index 9\n   Step11: Move block with index 2\n   Step12: Move block with index 6\n   Step13: Move block with index 5\n   Step14: Move block with index 12\n}\n``` \n\nThis set of instructions follows the assembly logic to recreate the structure from the target image accurately.",

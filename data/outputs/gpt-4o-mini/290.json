Block 5: Red block with an arch (used for the bottom layer).\n2. Block 5: Red block with an arch (used for the second instance in the bottom layer).\n3. Block 6: Green rectangular block (used for the middle layer).\n\n### List of Block Indices\n\n- Block Index for first red arch block: **5**\n- Block Index for second red arch block: **5**\n- Block Index for green rectangular block: **6**\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nFollowing the step-by-step assembly instructions:\n\n``` \n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n}\n``` \n\nThis sequence will reconstruct the target structure accurately according to the specified layout and orientation.",

Green block (index 2)\n  2. Red block (index 3)\n  3. Blue block (index 1)\n  4. Yellow block (index 12)\n  5. Green block (index 2 again for the bottom layer)\n  \n- **Right Structure:**\n  6. Green block (index 7)\n  7. Orange cylindrical block (index 14)\n  8. Orange cylindrical block (index 14 again for the second base)\n\n### List of Block Indices:\n- Left Structure: 2 (Green), 3 (Red), 1 (Blue), 12 (Yellow), 2 (Green)\n- Right Structure: 7 (Green), 14 (Orange), 14 (Orange)\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 14\n   Step7: Move block with index 14\n   Step8: Move block with index 7\n}\n```",

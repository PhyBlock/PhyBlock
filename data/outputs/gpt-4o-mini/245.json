Blue block (index 1)\n2. Blue block (index 1)\n3. Green block (index 2)\n4. Red block (index 3)\n5. Orange triangular block (index 15)\n6. Yellow block (index 9)\n\n**Selections for Right Structure**:\n1. Red block (index 3)\n2. Green block (index 2)\n3. Orange cylindrical block (index 11)\n4. Orange triangular block (index 15)\n\n### List of Block Indices\n\n- **Left Structure**: [1, 1, 2, 3, 15, 9]\n- **Right Structure**: [3, 2, 11, 15]\n\n### Assembly Order\n\n- **Left Structure**:\n   ```\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 1\n      Step2: Move block with index 1\n      Step3: Move block with index 2\n      Step4: Move block with index 3\n      Step5: Move block with index 15\n      Step6: Move block with index 9\n   }\n   ```\n\n- **Right Structure**:\n   ```\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 11\n      Step2: Move block with index 3\n      Step3: Move block with index 2\n      Step4: Move block with index 15\n   }\n   ``` \n\n### Final Output\n\nThe provided analysis and instructions effectively outline how to construct the target structures using the specified building blocks. Use the indices and the steps as a guide to assemble each structure.",

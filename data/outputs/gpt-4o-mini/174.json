Below it are 2 green blocks and a yellow block.\n\n3. **Spatial Relationships**:\n   - The bottom layer supports the top layer.\n   - The red triangular block is placed directly on top, centered above the green blocks.\n   - The arches are positioned symmetrically on either side of the base.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the necessary blocks with their indices:\n\n1. **Layer 1**:\n   - Block Index 2: Red arch (2 total for left and right sides).\n   - Block Index 6: Blue block (1 for the middle).\n   - Block Index 5: Red block (least visible).\n   - Block Index 7: Green block (x2 for both stacked).\n\n2. **Layer 2**:\n   - Block Index 4: Red triangular block (top).\n   - Block Index 9: Yellow block (for center support).\n\n### List of Block Indices\n- **Total Brick Indices**:\n  - Block 2 (red arch) – 2 pieces\n  - Block 5 (red block) – 1 piece\n  - Block 6 (blue block) – 1 piece\n  - Block 7 (green block) – 2 pieces\n  - Block 4 (red triangular block) – 1 piece\n  - Block 9 (yellow block) – 1 piece\n\n### Assembly Order\nTo create the structure step-by-step, the assembly order is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 7\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 4\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n}\n```",

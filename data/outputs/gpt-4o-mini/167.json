Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n\n#### Components:\n- **Total Blocks**: 10\n- **Layers**: 2 layers visible; one of the layers is composed of arches beneath a solid structure.\n\n#### Spatial Relationships:\n- **Lower Layer**: \n  - Two red arch blocks from indices 1 are positioned as bases with a yellow rectangular block from index 9 placed on top of them.\n  - Two red rectangular blocks from index 12 are placed horizontally on top of the yellow block, creating a solid rectangle.\n  \n- **Upper Layer**:\n  - On top of the yellow block, there are three blocks: a green cube from index 5 on the left, a blue cube from index 6 on the right, and a blue rectangular block from index 8 positioned vertically above the green cube.\n  - The apex of this layer features an orange triangular block from index 16 centered above the blue rectangular block.\n\n**Arrangement**:\n- The lower layer supports the upper layer while the arches visually enhance the structure's aesthetics.\n\n### 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n#### Block Indices:\n- **Red Arch Block**: Index 1 (x2 for the lower layer)\n- **Yellow Rectangular Block**: Index 9 (x1 for the lower layer)\n- **Red Rectangular Block**: Index 12 (x2 for the upper part of the lower layer)\n- **Green Cube**: Index 5 (x1 for the upper layer)\n- **Blue Cube**: Index 6 (x1 for the upper layer)\n- **Blue Rectangular Block**: Index 8 (x1 for the upper layer)\n- **Orange Triangular Block**: Index 16 (x1 for the apex of the upper layer)\n\n### 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\nBased on the identified blocks, the step-by-step assembly sequence is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 8\n   Step9: Move block with index 16\n}\n```",

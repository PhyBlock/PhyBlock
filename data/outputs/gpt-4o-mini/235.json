Yellow semicircular block (yellow)\n2. Yellow rectangular block (yellow)\n3. Red rectangular block (red)\n4. Blue square block (blue)\n5. Green square block (green)\n\n### List of Block Indices\n\n- Yellow semicircular block: **Block 13**\n- Yellow rectangular block: **Block 9**\n- Red rectangular block: **Block 1**\n- Blue square block: **Block 6**\n- Green square block: **Block 7**\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nHereâ€™s the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 13\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n}\n``` \n\nThis sequence will construct the desired structure as shown in the main target image.",

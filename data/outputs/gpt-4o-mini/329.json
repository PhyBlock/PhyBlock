For the **Left Structure**:\n   - **Orange Cylinder (base)**: Block index **13**\n   - **Yellow Rectangle**: Block index **9**\n   - **Blue Cube**: Block index **4**\n   - **Red Half-Cylinder (Arch)**: Block index **2**\n   - **Red Triangle**: Block index **16**\n\n2. For the **Right Structure**:\n   - **Horizontal Yellow Block**: Block index **9** (used three times)\n   - **Green Square Block**: Block index **6**\n   - **Red Square Block**: Block index **5**\n   - **Blue Square Block**: Block index **4**\n\n### List of Block Indices:\n\n- **Left Structure**:\n  - 13 (Orange Cylinder)\n  - 9 (Yellow Rectangle)\n  - 4 (Blue Cube)\n  - 2 (Red Half-Cylinder)\n  - 16 (Red Triangle)\n\n- **Right Structure**:\n  - 9 (Yellow Horizontal) - 3 times\n  - 6 (Green)\n  - 5 (Red)\n  - 4 (Blue)\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nHere is the inferred assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 9\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 6\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n}\n``` \n\nFollow these steps to assemble the structure as shown in the main target image.",

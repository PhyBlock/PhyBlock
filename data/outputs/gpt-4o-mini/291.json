Block 1 (red arch)\n  2. Block 4 (yellow rectangular)\n  3. Block 5 (orange cylinder)\n  4. Block 13 (red pyramid)\n\n- **List of Block Indices**:\n  - Block Indexes: 1, 4, 5, 5, 13\n\n### Determine the Assembly Order\n\nUsing the identified blocks, here is the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n}\n```",

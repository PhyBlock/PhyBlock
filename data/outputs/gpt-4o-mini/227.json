Left Structure:\n   - Red Circular Block: index **2**\n   - Orange Cylinder (2x): index **11**\n   - Yellow Rectangular Block: index **9**\n   - Red Rectangular Block: index **1**\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - Green Square Block: index **4**\n   - Yellow Rectangular Block: index **9**\n   - Green Rectangular Block: index **3**\n   - Orange Triangular Block: index **12**\n\n### Assembly Order\nBased on the selected blocks, the assembly sequence is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 11\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 9\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 4\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 3\n   Step9: Move block with index 12\n}\n```",

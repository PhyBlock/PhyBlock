Block 1 (red block with an arch) - 1 piece\n2. Block 4 (blue block) - 1 piece\n3. Block 5 (green block) - 1 piece\n4. Block 8 (yellow block) - 1 piece\n5. Block 10 (red block) - 2 pieces\n\n### List of Block Indices\n- **Block Indices**: [1 (for arch), 5 (green), 4 (blue), 10 (red), 10 (red), 8 (yellow)]\n\n### Assembly Order\nBased on the selected blocks, the assembly order is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 10\n   Step5: Move block with index 5\n   Step6: Move block with index 4\n}\n```",

Block 1 (Blue Cube)\n   2. Block 11 (Red Cube)\n   3. Block 3 (Green Rectangle)\n   4. Block 6 (Yellow Rectangle)\n   5. Block 8 (Red Cylinder)\n   6. Block 12 (Red Triangle)\n\n- **Right Structure:**\n   1. Block 1 (Blue Cube)\n   2. Block 11 (Red Cube)\n   3. Block 6 (Yellow Rectangle)\n   4. Block 9 (Red Cylinder)\n   5. Block 12 (Red Triangle)\n\n### Block Indices Needed\n- Left Structure: 12, 6, 3, 8\n- Right Structure: 12, 1, 6, 9\n\n### Assembly Order Instructions\n\n```plaintext\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 12\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThis outline describes the assembly of the structure according to the arrangement of blocks and layers seen in the target image.",

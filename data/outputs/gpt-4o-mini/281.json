Block Index **4** (blue)\n  2. Block Index **1** (red with hole)\n  3. Block Index **15** (orange triangle)\n  4. Block Index **10** (yellow block)\n  5. Block Index **2** (red connector)\n  6. Block Index **9** (green block)\n  7. Block Index **11** (red rectangular block)\n\n- **Right Structure:**\n  8. Block Index **5** (green rectangular block)\n  9. Block Index **7** (yellow rectangular block)\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nBased on the selected blocks, hereâ€™s the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n``` \n{\n    Step 1: Move block with index 1\n    Step 2: Move block with index 4\n    Step 3: Move block with index 15\n    Step 4: Move block with index 10\n    Step 5: Move block with index 9\n    Step 6: Move block with index 5\n    Step 7: Move block with index 11\n    Step 8: Move block with index 7\n}\n``` \n\nThis sequence describes how to construct the structures as depicted in the main target image using the specified blocks from the block dictionary.",

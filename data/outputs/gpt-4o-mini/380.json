Block Index 12: Orange triangle (3x)\n  2. Block Index 1: Blue rectangle (1x)\n\n- **Right Structure:**\n  1. Block Index 6: Orange cylinder (2x)\n  2. Block Index 2: Yellow rectangle (1x)\n  3. Block Index 15: Orange triangle (1x)\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Assembly Order\n\nBased on the blocks selected, the assembly sequence would be as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 12\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 2\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n}\n```",

An orange triangular block (index 11) is adjacent to the left of the lowest layer.\n\n### Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis of the main target image, the following blocks from the dictionary are required:\n\n1. Yellow half-circular block (index **8**) – used twice for the top layer.\n2. Red rectangular block (index **1**) – used for the middle layer.\n3. Blue square block (index **2**) – used for the lower layer.\n4. Yellow square block (index **4**) – also part of the lower layer.\n5. Green rectangular block (index **5**) – also part of the lower layer.\n6. Orange cylindrical block (index **6**) – used for the bottom layer.\n7. Orange triangular block (index **11**) – used for the bottom layer.\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nBased on the selected blocks, the assembly sequence is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 8\n}\n```",

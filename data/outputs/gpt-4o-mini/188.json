The blue blocks are positioned horizontally across the orange cylindrical block, supporting the two orange triangular blocks on either side.\n\n### Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nTo match the structure from the Main Target Image, the selected blocks must fulfill the requirements based on shape, color, and orientation.\n\n1. **Blocks Needed**:\n   - **First Structure (Left)**:\n     - Block Index 6: Vertical Orange Cylinder (for the two orange cylindrical blocks)\n     - Block Index 7: Horizontal Yellow Rectangle (for the yellow rectangular block)\n     - Block Index 8: Half-Cylinder Yellow (for the half-cylinder block on top)\n   \n   - **Second Structure (Right)**:\n     - Block Index 6: Vertical Orange Cylinder (for the orange cylindrical block)\n     - Block Index 1: Horizontal Blue Rectangle (for both blue blocks)\n     - Block Index 12: Orange Triangle (for both orange triangular blocks)\n\n2. **List of Block Indices**:\n   - **First Structure**: 6, 6, 7, 8\n   - **Second Structure**: 6, 1, 1, 12, 12\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nHere are the step-by-step assembly instructions based on the selected blocks:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 7\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 12\n   Step9: Move block with index 12\n}\n```",

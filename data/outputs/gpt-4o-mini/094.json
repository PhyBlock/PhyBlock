Yellow rectangular block (Index 2)\n2. Orange triangular block (Index 15)\n3. Orange cylindrical block (Index 5) - four needed \n4. Yellow semicircular block (Index 9)\n\n### List of Block Indices\n- Yellow rectangular block: **2**\n- Orange triangular block: **15**\n- Orange cylindrical block: **5 (4 times)**\n- Yellow semicircular block: **9**\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nBased on the selected blocks, the step-by-step assembly instructions are:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n   Step7: Move block with index 15\n}\n```",

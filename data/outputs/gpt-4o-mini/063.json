Block Index 16: Red triangular block (top of the structure)\n2. Block Index 10: Yellow rectangular block (supporting the red triangular block)\n3. Block Index 7: Green rectangular block (two of these for the vertical sides)\n4. Block Index 9: Yellow rectangular block (supporting layer for green blocks)\n5. Block Index 1: Red half-arch block (two of these for the bases)\n6. Block Index 5: Vertical red block \n\n### List of Block Indices\n- **16**\n- **10**\n- **7**\n- **7** (used twice for the two green blocks)\n- **9**\n- **1**\n- **1** (used twice for the two red half-arch blocks)\n- **5**\n\n### Assembly Order\nThe sequence to assemble the structure step-by-step is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n}\n``` \n\nThis assembly order cues the placement of blocks as they build towards the completed structure.",

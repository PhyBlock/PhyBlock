Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

    "predict": "## Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:\n\n### Count & Layers:\n- **Block Count:** The structure consists of 7 blocks.\n- **Layers:** The structure has 3 layers.\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n1. **Base Layer:**\n   - A green rectangular block (index 5) is at the base.\n   - An orange cylindrical block (index 9) is placed on top of the green block.\n\n2. **Middle Layer:**\n   - A green rectangular block (index 5) is placed on top of the orange cylinder.\n\n3. **Top Layer:**\n   - A red triangular block (index 13) is placed on top of the green block.\n   - Two yellow semi-circular blocks (index 10) are placed on either side of the red triangular block.\n   - A red rectangular block with a hole (index 1) is placed in front of the red triangular block.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n### Identified Needed Blocks:\n1. Green rectangular block (horizontal) - Index 5\n2. Orange cylindrical block - Index 9\n3. Green rectangular block (horizontal) - Index 5\n4. Red triangular block - Index 13\n5. Yellow semi-circular block - Index 10\n6. Yellow semi-circular block - Index 10\n7. Red rectangular block with a hole - Index 1\n\n### List of Block Indices:\n- 5 (Green rectangular block)\n- 9 (Orange cylindrical block)\n- 5 (Green rectangular block)\n- 13 (Red triangular block)\n- 10 (Yellow semi-circular block)\n- 10 (Yellow semi-circular block)\n- 1 (Red rectangular block with a hole)\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\n### Assembly Instructions:\n```json\n{\n   \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n   \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n   \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n   \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n   \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n   \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n   \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that the blocks are assembled in the correct order to match the target structure."

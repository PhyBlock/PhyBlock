    "instruction": "<IMG_CONTEXT><IMG_CONTEXT>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

    "predict": "## Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:\n\n### Count & Layers:\n- **Block Count:** The structure consists of 5 blocks.\n- **Layers:** The structure has 2 layers.\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- **Base Layer:** \n  - A yellow rectangular block (horizontal) forms the base.\n  - A green rectangular block (vertical) is placed on the left side of the base.\n  - A red rectangular block (vertical) is placed on the right side of the base.\n- **Top Layer:**\n  - A blue rectangular block (vertical) is placed on top of the red block.\n  - A yellow rectangular block (horizontal) is placed on top of the green and red blocks, spanning the width of both.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n### Identified Needed Blocks:\n1. Yellow rectangular block (horizontal) for the base.\n2. Green rectangular block (vertical) for the left side.\n3. Red rectangular block (vertical) for the right side.\n4. Blue rectangular block (vertical) for the top layer.\n5. Yellow rectangular block (horizontal) for the top layer.\n\n### List Block Indices:\n- **Base Layer:**\n  - Yellow block (horizontal): Index 12\n  - Green block (vertical): Index 7\n  - Red block (vertical): Index 13\n- **Top Layer:**\n  - Blue block (vertical): Index 1\n  - Yellow block (horizontal): Index 12\n\n## Determination of Assembly Order:\n\n### Assembly Instructions:\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures the structure is built layer by layer, matching the target image exactly."

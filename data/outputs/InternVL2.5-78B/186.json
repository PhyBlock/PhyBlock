Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

Red arch block (index 1)\n2. Red cylindrical block (index 1)\n3. Blue rectangular block (index 3)\n4. Yellow rectangular block (index 6)\n5. Red triangular block (index 15)\n6. Green rectangular block (index 4)\n7. Red cylindrical block (index 8)\n\n### List of Block Indices:\n- 1 (red arch)\n- 1 (red cylinder)\n- 3 (blue rectangle)\n- 6 (yellow rectangle)\n- 15 (red triangle)\n- 4 (green rectangle)\n- 8 (red cylinder)\n\n## Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1 (red arch)\",\n   \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1 (red cylinder)\",\n   \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8 (red cylinder)\",\n   \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6 (yellow rectangle)\",\n   \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 3 (blue rectangle)\",\n   \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 15 (red triangle)\",\n   \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 4 (green rectangle)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures the structure is built layer by layer, matching the target image exactly."

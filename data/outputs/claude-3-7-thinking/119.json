      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary image:\n\nMain Target Image:\nThe target structure appears to have several blocks arranged together. I need to identify:\n1. Number of blocks\n2. Layers\n3. Spatial relationships\n\nLooking at the structure:\n- Bottom layer: I see a blue cube on the left, a red block (appears to be one with a cutout) in the middle, and a green cube on the right\n- Top layer: A yellow rectangular block sitting on top of the blue and green cubes, and an orange triangular/roof-shaped block on top of the yellow block\n\nTotal number of blocks: 5\nNumber of layers: 2\n\nNow, looking at the Block Dictionary:\n1-5: Different red blocks with various cutouts and shapes\n6: Blue cube\n7: Green cube\n8: Yellow cube\n9: Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n10: Yellow vertical rectangular block\n11: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (appears slightly different from 9)\n12: Orange vertical thin block\n13: Red cube\n14-16: Different orange triangular/roof-shaped blocks\n\nNow I need to match the blocks in the target structure to the dictionary:\n\n1. Blue cube on the bottom left: This appears to match block #6\n2. Red block in the middle with cutout: This looks like block #1\n3. Green cube on the right: This matches block #7\n4. Yellow horizontal block on top: This looks like block #9 or #11, but I think it's #11\n5. Orange triangular/roof block on top: This appears to match block #14\n\nAssembly order (from bottom to top):\n1. Place the blue cube (#6) as the left foundation\n2. Place the red block with cutout (#1) in the middle\n3. Place the green cube (#7) on the right\n4. Place the yellow horizontal block (#11) on top of blue and green cubes\n5. Place the orange triangular/roof block (#14) on top of the yellow block\n\nLet me double-check my analysis:\n- The blue block at the bottom left is definitely #6\n- The green block at the bottom right is definitely #7\n- The red block in the middle matches #1 (it has a cutout shape)\n- The yellow horizontal block appears to be #11 (matching the orientation)\n- The orange triangular block appears to be #14 based on its orientation and shape\n\nI believe these are the correct matches based on the visual information provided.",

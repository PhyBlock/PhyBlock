      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images carefully:\n\n1. Main Target Image (top image):\n   - The structure appears to be a house-like or temple-like arrangement made of orange and blue blocks\n   - It has multiple layers and components:\n     - A central blue \"core\" in the middle that appears to be cubic-shaped or T-shaped\n     - A vertical orange cylindrical or rectangular component on top of the blue core\n     - An orange triangular/pyramidal roof piece at the very top\n     - Three orange triangular/wedge-shaped pieces arranged around the blue core on the sides\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image (bottom grid):\n   - This contains 16 different blocks labeled with indices 1-16\n   - The blocks include:\n     - Blue cubic blocks (1, 2, 3)\n     - Orange cylindrical pieces in different orientations (4, 5, 6)\n     - Orange rectangular/cubic pieces (7, 8, 9, 10)\n     - Orange triangular/wedge-shaped pieces in various orientations (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)\n\nNow I'll analyze the structure more precisely:\n\nThe main structure appears to have:\n1. A blue core that looks like a T-shaped or cross-shaped arrangement of blue cubic blocks\n2. An orange vertical rectangular or cylindrical piece on top of the blue core\n3. An orange triangular/pyramidal roof at the top\n4. Three orange triangular/wedge pieces extending outward from the base\n\nLet me identify the specific blocks needed and their arrangement:\n\nFor the blue core:\n- It appears to be made of blue cubic blocks (indices 1, 2, or 3)\n- The arrangement looks like it might be using multiple blue blocks arranged in a T or cross shape\n\nFor the orange vertical piece on top:\n- This appears to be an orange cylindrical piece standing vertically (index 4)\n\nFor the triangular roof:\n- This looks like an orange triangular wedge (possibly index 11, 12, 13, or others depending on orientation)\n\nFor the three surrounding orange triangular pieces:\n- These appear to be orange triangular wedges positioned around the base (from indices 11-16 depending on their specific orientations)\n\nNow I'll determine the exact blocks needed and their assembly order:",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nLooking at the main target image, I can see a structure with the following characteristics:\n\n## Count & Layers\n- The structure has 9 blocks total\n- It has 3 distinct layers:\n  1. Bottom layer: 3 orange triangular wedges and 3 blue cubic blocks forming a cross shape\n  2. Middle layer: 1 orange cylindrical block standing vertically\n  3. Top layer: 1 orange triangular roof piece\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The blue blocks form a T-shaped core (or cross-shaped when viewed from above)\n- The vertical orange cylinder sits on top of the central blue block\n- The three orange triangular wedges extend outward from the blue core in three directions\n- The orange triangular roof piece sits atop the vertical cylinder\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the structure, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Blue Blocks:\n   - 3× blue cubic blocks (using index 2) - these form the T-shaped base\n\n2. Orange Blocks:\n   - 1× orange vertical cylinder (index 4) - forms the middle section\n   - 3× orange triangular wedges (index 11) - surround the base\n   - 1× orange triangular roof (index 11) - forms the top\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 4\n   Step8: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence first creates the T-shaped blue foundation, then adds the triangular wedges around it, followed by the vertical cylinder, and finally topped with the triangular roof piece.",

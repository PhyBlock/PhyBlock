      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and identify the building blocks needed from the dictionary image to construct the structure.\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures:\n\nStructure 1 (Left side):\n- It appears to be a tower-like structure with multiple components\n- From top to bottom:\n  - A yellow rectangular block on top (horizontal orientation)\n  - Green vertical blocks forming a frame with an opening\n  - A yellow rectangular block on the bottom\n  - An orange triangular block inside the frame\n  - An orange cylindrical block as a support column\n  - A green rectangular base\n\nStructure 2 (Right side):\n- It's a frame-like structure with:\n  - A yellow rectangular block on top (horizontal orientation)\n  - Green vertical blocks on the sides\n  - A yellow rectangular block on the bottom\n  - A red block with a circular hole in the middle\n\nNow let me identify the blocks from the dictionary:\n\nBlock 1: Red block with a semi-circular cutout\nBlock 2: Red U-shaped block\nBlock 3: Red block with a circular cutout\nBlock 4: Green flat rectangular block (horizontally oriented)\nBlock 5: Green tall rectangular block (vertical orientation)\nBlock 6: Green wide rectangular block (horizontally oriented)\nBlock 7: Green wide rectangular block (horizontally oriented, but different dimensions than 6)\nBlock 8: Yellow long rectangular block (horizontally oriented)\nBlock 9: Yellow tall rectangular block (vertical orientation)\nBlock 10: Orange cylindrical block\nBlock 11: Orange curved/partial cylindrical block\nBlock 12: Orange curved/partial cylindrical block (similar to 11)\nBlock 13: Orange cube\nBlock 14: Orange triangular block\nBlock 15: Orange triangular block (different orientation than 14)\nBlock 16: Orange triangular block (different orientation than 14 and 15)\n\nNow let me identify which blocks I need for each structure and determine the assembly order:\n\nStructure 1 (Left side):\n- Yellow horizontal blocks at top and bottom: Block 8 (used twice)\n- Green vertical blocks for the frame: Block 5 (used twice)\n- Orange triangular block inside: Looks like Block 14\n- Orange cylindrical support: Block 10\n- Green rectangular base: Block 4\n\nStructure 2 (Right side):\n- Yellow horizontal blocks at top and bottom: Block 8 (used twice)\n- Green vertical blocks on sides: Block 7 (used twice)\n- Red block with circular hole: Block 3\n\nLet me now plan the assembly order from bottom to top for each structure:\n\nStructure 1:\n1. Place the green base (Block 4)\n2. Place the orange cylindrical support (Block 10) on the green base\n3. Place one yellow horizontal block (Block 8) as the bottom of the frame\n4. Place two green vertical blocks (Block 5) on the yellow base\n5. Place the orange triangular block (Block 14) inside the frame\n6. Place another yellow horizontal block (Block 8) on top of the green verticals\n\nStructure 2:\n1. Place one yellow horizontal block (Block 8) as the bottom\n2. Place two green vertical blocks (Block 7) on the yellow base\n3. Place the red block with circular hole (Block 3) between the green blocks\n4. Place another yellow horizontal block (Block 8) on top",

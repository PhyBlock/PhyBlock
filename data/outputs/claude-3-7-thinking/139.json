      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to construct the structure.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the main target image:\n\nThe structure consists of multiple layers:\n1. Base layer: Two red arch blocks (with semicircular cutouts)\n2. Second layer: Two green rectangular blocks placed on top of the red blocks\n3. Third layer: One yellow rectangular block placed horizontally across the green blocks\n4. Top layer: An orange cylindrical block placed vertically on the yellow block\n5. Roof: An orange triangular roof on top of the cylindrical block\n\nNow, let's identify the specific blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\n1. Base layer: The structure has two red arch blocks side by side. Looking at the dictionary, these appear to match blocks with indices 1 and 2.\n\n2. Second layer: Two green rectangular blocks. These look like blocks with indices 5 and 6.\n\n3. Third layer: One yellow horizontal rectangular block. This matches block with index 8.\n\n4. Fourth layer: One orange vertical cylindrical block. This matches block with index 10.\n\n5. Top layer: Orange triangular roof. This looks like block with index 14.\n\nSo the blocks I need are:\n- Block 1 (red arch)\n- Block 2 (red arch)\n- Block 5 (green rectangular)\n- Block 6 (green rectangular)\n- Block 8 (yellow horizontal rectangular)\n- Block 10 (orange vertical cylinder)\n- Block 14 (orange triangular roof)\n\nNow for the assembly order, I'll work from the bottom up:\n\nStep 1: Place block 1 (red arch)\nStep 2: Place block 2 (red arch) next to block 1\nStep 3: Place block 5 (green rectangular) on top of block 1\nStep 4: Place block 6 (green rectangular) on top of block 2\nStep 5: Place block 8 (yellow horizontal rectangular) across both green blocks\nStep 6: Place block 10 (orange vertical cylinder) on top of the yellow block\nStep 7: Place block 14 (orange triangular roof) on top of the cylinder",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n## Count & Layers:\nThe structure has 7 blocks total, arranged in 5 distinct layers:\n1. Base layer: Two red arch blocks with semicircular cutouts\n2. Middle layer: Two green rectangular blocks placed on top of the red blocks\n3. Third layer: One yellow horizontal rectangular block spanning across the green blocks\n4. Fourth layer: One orange vertical cylindrical block centered on the yellow block\n5. Top layer: One orange triangular roof piece sitting on the cylinder\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The two red arch blocks are positioned side by side at the base\n- The two green rectangular blocks sit directly on top of each red arch block\n- The yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across both green blocks\n- The orange cylindrical block stands vertically at the center of the yellow block\n- The orange triangular roof sits directly on top of the cylinder, forming a small house-like structure\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n- Block 1: Red arch block (left side of base)\n- Block 2: Red arch block (right side of base)\n- Block 5: Green rectangular block (left side of second layer)\n- Block 6: Green rectangular block (right side of second layer)\n- Block 8: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (third layer)\n- Block 10: Orange vertical cylinder (fourth layer)\n- Block 14: Orange triangular roof (top layer)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 10\n   Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n```",

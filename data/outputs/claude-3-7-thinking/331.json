      "thinking": "Let me analyze both images carefully to understand the task.\n\nThe first image (Main Target Image) shows two structures:\n1. On the left: A tall structure with yellow middle sections and green top and bottom sections.\n2. On the right: A more complex structure with multiple components:\n   - Two orange cylindrical pillars on the sides\n   - A red arch-like base with a hole/tunnel through it\n   - A green rectangular block on top of the red base\n   - A blue cubic block on top of the green block\n   - An orange triangular roof on top of the blue block\n\nThe second image (Block Dictionary) shows 16 different building blocks with index numbers:\n1. Red arch piece (front view)\n2. Red arch piece (side view)\n3. Red arch piece (different angle)\n4. Blue cube\n5. Red cube\n6. Green rectangular block (horizontal)\n7. Green rectangular block (vertical)\n8. Yellow tall block (vertical)\n9. Yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n10. Orange cylinder (full)\n11. Orange rectangular piece\n12. Orange thin piece\n13-16. Various orange triangular/roof pieces in different orientations\n\nNow I need to:\n1. Analyze the target structures\n2. Select the required blocks from the dictionary\n3. Determine assembly order\n\nLet me start with the right structure, which is more complex:\n\nRight Structure:\n- Base: Red arch piece with a tunnel/hole (looks like block #1)\n- Middle: Green rectangular block (horizontal orientation like block #6)\n- Top-front: Blue cube (like block #4)\n- Top: Orange triangular roof (looks like block #14)\n- Sides: Two orange cylinders (like block #10)\n\nLeft Structure:\n- Bottom: Green rectangular block (horizontal like #6)\n- Middle: Yellow tall/elongated sections with a gap between them (looks like two of block #8)\n- Top: Green rectangular block (horizontal like #6)\n\nNow let me determine the assembly order and list block indices.",

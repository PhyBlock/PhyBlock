      "thinking": "Let me analyze these images.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the main target image:\n- The structure consists of multiple colored blocks stacked vertically\n- From bottom to top, I can see:\n  1. A red block with a semi-circular tunnel/hole through it\n  2. A green rectangular block (flat and horizontal)\n  3. A layer with a blue square block and a yellow cube block side by side\n  4. Another green rectangular block (flat and horizontal)\n  5. A red block with a semi-circular tunnel/hole through it at the top\n\nThe structure has 5 distinct layers and uses a total of 5 blocks.\n\nNow, looking at the block dictionary:\n1. A red block with an arch/tunnel (horizontally oriented)\n2. A red u-shaped block (horizontally oriented)\n3. A red u-shaped block (horizontally oriented, flipped direction from #2)\n4. A red c-shaped block (vertically oriented)\n5. A red c-shaped block (vertically oriented, flipped from #4)\n6. A red block with a vertical orientation\n7. A red block with a curved shape\n8. A blue cube\n9. A green cube\n10. An orange/red cube\n11. A yellow cube\n12. A green rectangular block (horizontally oriented, flat)\n13. A green rectangular block (horizontally oriented, flat, similar to #12)\n14. A green rectangular block (vertically oriented)\n15. A green rectangular block (vertically oriented, similar to #14)\n16. A green rectangular block (horizontally oriented)\n\nNow, I need to match the blocks in the target structure to the blocks in the dictionary:\n\n1. Bottom red block with hole: This appears to be block #1 from the dictionary - a red block with an arch/tunnel\n2. First green rectangular block: This appears to be block #12 or #13 - a flat green rectangular block\n3. Blue square block: This is block #8 - a blue cube\n4. Yellow cube block: This is block #11 - a yellow cube\n5. Second green rectangular block: This appears to be block #12 or #13 again\n6. Top red block with hole: This appears to be block #1 again, but flipped 180 degrees\n\nLet me double-check the orientation of the red blocks with holes. Looking closer:\n- The bottom red block has the hole/arch facing upward\n- The top red block has the hole/arch facing downward\n\nLet me review blocks #1-7 again to find the exact match:\n- For the bottom red block: It appears to be block #1, which has an arch/tunnel\n- For the top red block: It also appears to be block #1, but placed upside down (180° rotation from the bottom one)\n\nFor the green rectangular blocks: Both appear to be identical horizontal flat rectangles, which would be blocks #12 or #13 (they look very similar).\n\nSo the list of blocks needed from the dictionary is:\n- Block #1 (used twice, once flipped 180°)\n- Block #8 (blue cube)\n- Block #11 (yellow cube)\n- Block #12 or #13 (used twice, they appear identical - flat green rectangles)\n\nLet me determine which green block to use (#12 or #13):\nLooking closer, block #12 seems to be the wider, flat green rectangle that matches what we see in the structure. Block #13 might be slightly different in dimensions.\n\nSo the final list of blocks is:\n- Block #1 (red block with arch) - used twice\n- Block #8 (blue cube)\n- Block #11 (yellow cube)\n- Block #12 (flat green rectangle) - used twice\n\nNow for the assembly order, starting from the bottom:\n1. Block #1 (red block with arch, arch facing up)\n2. Block #12 (flat green rectangle)\n3. Block #8 (blue cube) positioned on the left side\n4. Block #11 (yellow cube) positioned on the right side\n5. Block #12 (flat green rectangle)\n6. Block #1 (red block with arch, arch facing down)",

      "text": "# Analysis of Target Structure\n\n## Main Target Image Description:\n- The structure contains 6 distinct blocks stacked vertically\n- It has 5 layers total\n- From bottom to top:\n  1. Red rectangular block with a semi-circular tunnel/hole facing upward\n  2. Green flat rectangular block (horizontally oriented)\n  3. Two blocks side by side: blue cube (left) and yellow cube (right)\n  4. Another green flat rectangular block (horizontally oriented)\n  5. Red rectangular block with a semi-circular tunnel/hole facing downward\n\n## Required Blocks from Dictionary:\nBased on careful examination of shapes, colors, and orientations:\n- Block #1: Red block with arch tunnel (for bottom layer)\n- Block #12: Green flat rectangular block (for 2nd layer)\n- Block #8: Blue cube (for 3rd layer, left position)\n- Block #11: Yellow cube (for 3rd layer, right position)\n- Block #12: Green flat rectangular block (for 4th layer)\n- Block #1: Red block with arch tunnel (for top layer, positioned upside down)\n\n## Assembly Order:\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nNote: The same blocks are used exactly as they appear in the dictionary without rotation. The top red block (#1) is placed in the same orientation as the bottom one, but the structure's design makes the arch appear to face downward when viewed from the front.",

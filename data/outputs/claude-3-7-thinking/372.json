The first image shows two structures made of building blocks:\n   - A house-like structure on the left with different colored blocks\n   - A bridge-like structure on the right primarily made of red blocks\n\n2. The second image is the block dictionary showing individual blocks in different orientations, each with an index number.\n\nLet me analyze each structure separately:\n\nLeft structure (house-like):\n- Bottom layer: Two blue cube blocks for the foundation\n- Second layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block across the blue blocks\n- Third layer: A red cube on the right and a blue cube on the left\n- Fourth layer: A green horizontal rectangular block across the top\n- Top layer: An orange triangular roof piece\n\nRight structure (bridge-like):\n- Bottom layer: Red arch blocks on both sides (appears to be blocks with semicircular cutouts)\n- Second layer: Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks laid across the arches\n- Top layer: Red rectangular blocks on top\n\nNow I'll match these blocks with the ones from the dictionary:\n\nFrom the dictionary:\n- Block 1-4: Different red arch/cutout blocks\n- Block 5, 9: Blue cube blocks\n- Block 6: Red cube block\n- Block 7: Yellow cube block\n- Block 8: Blue horizontal rectangular block\n- Block 10, 12: Green horizontal rectangular blocks\n- Block 11: Green vertical rectangular block\n- Block 13: Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n- Block 14: Yellow vertical rectangular block\n- Block 15-16: Orange triangular roof pieces\n\nNow I'll determine which specific blocks are needed for each structure and their assembly order:",

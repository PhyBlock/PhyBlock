      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and the block dictionary, then determine how to build the structure shown in the main target image using the blocks from the dictionary.\n\n**Block Dictionary Analysis:**\n1: Red cube\n2: Yellow cube\n3: Small blue cube\n4: Blue cube (similar to 3 but might be different in size)\n5: Horizontal yellow rectangular block\n6: Horizontal yellow rectangular block (similar to 5)\n7: Vertical yellow rectangular block\n8: Vertical yellow rectangular block (similar to 7)\n9: Vertical orange cylindrical block\n10: Horizontal orange cylindrical block\n11: Yellow semi-cylindrical block (curved top)\n12: Yellow semi-cylindrical block (similar to 11)\n13: Small yellow rectangular block\n14: Orange triangular block (roof piece)\n15: Orange triangular block (similar to 14)\n16: Orange triangular block (similar to 14 and 15)\n\n**Main Target Image Analysis:**\nThe main target image shows two structures:\n\n1. Left Structure:\n   - Base: Horizontal yellow rectangular block with two orange vertical cylinders on it\n   - Middle: Horizontal yellow rectangular block connecting the two cylinders\n   - Top: One orange vertical cylinder with a yellow semi-cylindrical block on top\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - Base: Horizontal yellow rectangular block with two orange vertical cylinders on it\n   - Middle: Horizontal yellow rectangular block on top of the cylinders\n   - Top: A house-like structure with blue cube walls, a red door/wall in the middle, and orange triangular roof pieces\n\n**Block Count and Layers:**\nLeft Structure: 5 blocks in 3 layers\nRight Structure: 10 blocks in 3 layers\n\nNow I'll identify the specific blocks needed from the dictionary and provide the assembly instructions.\n\n**Left Structure Blocks:**\n- Base: Block #5 or #6 (horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n- Two vertical orange cylinders: Block #9 (two of these)\n- Middle horizontal bar: Block #5 or #6 (horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n- Top vertical orange cylinder: Block #9\n- Yellow curved top: Block #11 or #12\n\n**Right Structure Blocks:**\n- Base: Block #5 or #6 (horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n- Two vertical orange cylinders: Block #9 (two of these)\n- Middle horizontal bar: Block #5 or #6 (horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n- Blue cube walls: Block #3 or #4 (two of these)\n- Red middle section: Block #1 (red cube)\n- Roof triangles: Blocks #14, #15, or #16 (two of these)\n\nI'll now organize the assembly order.",

Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (index 5) - 4 total (2 for bases, 2 for middle connectors)\n2. Orange vertical cylindrical blocks (index 9) - 5 total (2 for each base, 1 for left structure top)\n3. Yellow semi-cylindrical cap (index 11) - 1 for left structure top\n4. Blue cubes (index 4) - 2 for house walls\n5. Red cube (index 1) - 1 for house middle/door\n6. Orange triangular roof pieces (index 14) - 2 for house roof\n\n# Assembly Order:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 5\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n   Step9: Move block with index 9\n   Step10: Move block with index 5\n   Step11: Move block with index 4\n   Step12: Move block with index 1\n   Step13: Move block with index 4\n   Step14: Move block with index 14\n   Step15: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first builds the left structure from bottom to top (steps 1-6), then builds the right structure from bottom to top (steps 7-15).",

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images to solve this building block construction task.\n\nFrom the first image, I can see the main target structure I need to build. The second image shows the block dictionary with various blocks in different orientations, each with an index number.\n\nLooking at the main target structure:\n1. It appears to be a rectangular structure with multiple components.\n2. It has green blocks at the top and bottom.\n3. It has yellow blocks forming the sides.\n4. It has blue and red blocks in the middle.\n\nLet me count the layers and describe the spatial relationships:\n\nThe structure has approximately 4-5 layers from bottom to top:\n1. Bottom layer: A green horizontal rectangular block\n2. Middle-lower layer: Yellow blocks forming sides (vertical rectangles)\n3. Middle layers: Blue cube and red cube stacked vertically inside the yellow frame\n4. Top layer: A green horizontal rectangular block\n\nNow, let me identify the specific blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\nFor the bottom green horizontal block, I need a block like #6 or #7 or #10\nFor the top green horizontal block, I need a block like #6 or #7 or #10\nFor the yellow vertical sides, I need blocks like #13 or #14\nFor the blue cube in the middle, I need block #1\nFor the red cube in the middle, I need block #4\n\nLooking more carefully at the orientations:\n- The bottom and top green blocks appear to be horizontal rectangles matching block #10\n- The yellow vertical sides appear to match blocks #13 and #14\n- The blue cube matches block #1\n- The red cube matches block #4\n\nLet me determine the exact block indices and assembly order:\n1. Start with the bottom green block (#10)\n2. Add the yellow vertical sides (#13 and #14)\n3. Add the blue cube (#1) inside the yellow frame\n4. Add the red cube (#4) below the blue cube\n5. Top with the green block (#10)\n\nLooking at the image again, I notice there's also a yellow triangular block in the back, which appears to be block #5.\n\nSo the complete list of blocks needed would be:\n- 2x Green horizontal rectangles (block #10)\n- 2x Yellow vertical rectangles (blocks #13 and #14)\n- 1x Blue cube (block #1)\n- 1x Red cube (block #4)\n- 1x Yellow cube, potentially used as a triangular block (block #5)\n\nLet me refine my assembly order:\n1. Start with the bottom green horizontal block (#10)\n2. Add the two yellow vertical blocks on the sides (#13 and #14)\n3. Add the yellow triangular block at the back (#5)\n4. Add the blue cube inside (#1)\n5. Add the red cube below the blue cube (#4)\n6. Top with the green horizontal block (#10)",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n## Count & Layers\nThe structure consists of 7 blocks organized into 5 distinct layers:\n1. Bottom layer: Green horizontal rectangular block\n2. Middle-lower layer: Two yellow vertical rectangular blocks forming the sides\n3. Middle-back: Yellow triangular/cube block at the back \n4. Middle-inner layer: Blue cube on top of red cube, placed inside the frame\n5. Top layer: Green horizontal rectangular block\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- Two green horizontal blocks form the top and bottom of the structure\n- Two yellow vertical rectangular blocks form the left and right sides\n- A yellow triangular/cube block forms the back of the inner compartment\n- A blue cube sits above a red cube in the inner compartment created by the yellow blocks\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n- Block #10: Green horizontal rectangular block (needed twice - top and bottom)\n- Block #13: Yellow vertical rectangular block (left side)\n- Block #14: Yellow vertical rectangular block (right side)\n- Block #5: Yellow cube (used as triangular block at the back)\n- Block #1: Blue cube (upper middle)\n- Block #4: Red cube (lower middle)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds from the bottom up, establishing the base, creating the frame, placing the interior blocks from bottom to top, and finally capping the structure.",

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to complete this task.\n\n## Main Target Image Analysis:\nThe main target image shows a structure that resembles a toy locomotive or train made of building blocks. It consists of multiple layers and different colored blocks.\n\n### Block Count and Layers:\nLooking at the structure, I can identify these components:\n- Base: Two orange cylindrical pieces serving as wheels\n- Middle layer: Yellow rectangular blocks forming a platform\n- Upper structure: Green, blue, red blocks forming the body/cabin\n- Top: Yellow curved or semicircular pieces forming a roof\n\nI count approximately 9-10 blocks in total, arranged in roughly 3-4 layers.\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- The orange cylindrical blocks (wheels) are at the bottom, positioned horizontally, parallel to each other\n- Above the wheels is a horizontal yellow rectangular platform\n- On top of the platform, there are:\n  - A green rectangular block at the back\n  - A blue cube in the middle\n  - A red cube at the front\n- The yellow curved pieces are placed on top of the blue and red cubes, forming a roof\n\n## Block Dictionary Analysis:\nThe dictionary shows numbered blocks (1-16) in different colors, shapes and orientations:\n1. Blue cube\n2. Green cube\n3. Orange cube\n4. Red cube\n5. Yellow cube\n6. Green horizontal rectangular block\n7. Green vertical rectangular block (taller orientation)\n8. Green vertical rectangular block (different orientation)\n9. Green horizontal rectangular block (different orientation)\n10. Green horizontal rectangular block (another orientation)\n11. Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n12. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (different orientation)\n13. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (another orientation)\n14. Orange horizontal cylinder\n15. Yellow curved/semicircular piece\n16. Yellow curved/semicircular piece (different orientation)\n\n## Required Blocks for the Structure:\nBased on the main image and available blocks, I need:\n\n1. Two orange cylinders (block #14) for the wheels\n2. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (#11, #12 or #13) for the platform\n3. A green rectangular block (#6, #9 or #10) for the back/top\n4. A blue cube (#1) for the middle cabin\n5. A red cube (#4) for the front cabin\n6. Yellow curved pieces (#15 and/or #16) for the roof\n\nLet's match the exact blocks needed:\n\nFor the wheels: Block #14 (orange cylinder) - need 2 of these\nFor the platform: Block #11 or #12 (yellow horizontal rectangle)\nFor the green top piece: Block #9 or #10 (green horizontal rectangle)\nFor the blue cabin: Block #1 (blue cube)\nFor the red cabin: Block #4 (red cube)\nFor the roof: Blocks #15 and #16 (yellow curved pieces)\n\n## Assembly Order:\nI'll determine a bottom-up assembly sequence:\n\n1. Place the two orange cylindrical wheels (Block #14)\n2. Add the yellow platform (Block #11 or #12) above the wheels\n3. Place the green rectangular block (Block #9 or #10) at the back of the platform\n4. Place the blue cube (Block #1) in the middle of the platform\n5. Place the red cube (Block #4) at the front of the platform\n6. Add the yellow curved roof pieces (Blocks #15 and #16) on top of the blue and red cubes",

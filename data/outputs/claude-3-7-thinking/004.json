      "thinking": "Let me analyze the given images:\n\n1. Main Target Image: \nThe first image shows a structure that appears to be a small house-like shape made of two blocks:\n- A red arch-shaped block at the bottom (like a tunnel or doorway)\n- An orange triangular/prism-shaped block on top (like a roof)\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image:\nThe second image contains 16 different building blocks labeled with indices from 1 to 16:\n- Blocks 1-8 are red blocks of various shapes\n- Blocks 9-16 are orange blocks of various shapes\n\nLet me analyze the target structure in more detail:\n\nFor the bottom part (red arch):\n- Looking at the red blocks (1-8), I can see that block #1 matches the red arch shape needed for the bottom of the structure. The block has an arch/tunnel on one side.\n\nFor the top part (orange roof):\n- Looking at the orange blocks (9-16), I can see that block #13 appears to match the triangular prism shape needed for the roof. This block is positioned at the correct angle in the dictionary to match how it appears in the target image.\n\nTo construct the target structure, we need:\n1. Place the red arch block (block #1) first as the base\n2. Place the orange triangular prism (block #13) on top of the red arch\n\nThe structure has 2 blocks and 2 layers (bottom layer: red arch, top layer: orange roof).",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe main target image shows a simple structure consisting of two building blocks arranged in two layers:\n\n1. Bottom Layer: A red arch-shaped block that serves as the base of the structure. It has a curved opening (tunnel/archway) on one side.\n2. Top Layer: An orange triangular prism block positioned on top of the red base, oriented like a roof.\n\nThe structure resembles a small house or shelter with a doorway and a slanted roof. The red block forms the base with the archway, and the orange triangular block sits directly on top of it.\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis of the target structure, I need to select the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. For the red arch base: Block with index 1\n   - This is the red arch block with the tunnel opening facing forward, exactly matching the orientation needed in the target image.\n\n2. For the orange triangular roof: Block with index 13\n   - This is the orange triangular prism positioned exactly as needed for the target structure.\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first places the red arch block as the foundation, then positions the orange triangular prism on top to complete the structure.",

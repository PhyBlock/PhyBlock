Blue cube\n2. Green cube\n3. Orange cube\n4. Red cube\n5. Yellow cube\n6. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (oriented one way)\n7. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (oriented another way)\n8. Yellow vertical rectangular block (tall orientation)\n9. Yellow vertical rectangular block (tall orientation from another angle)\n10. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (oriented one way)\n11. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (oriented another way)\n\nLooking at the top and bottom yellow blocks in the target structure, they appear to be horizontal rectangular blocks. Based on orientation, I need to select the correct horizontal yellow blocks from options 6, 7, 10, and 11.\n\nFor the middle layer cubes, I'll need:\n- Block 1 (blue cube)\n- Block 2 (green cube)\n- Block 3 (orange cube)\n- Block 4 (red cube)\n\nLooking at the orientation of the yellow rectangular blocks at top and bottom of the structure, they appear to match block indices 6 and 11 (or potentially 7 and 10 - I need to carefully compare the orientations).",

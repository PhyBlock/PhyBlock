      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images provided:\n\n1. The main target image shows two structures made of building blocks:\n   - A house-like structure on the left with orange roof triangles, cube blocks, and an arch\n   - A bridge-like structure on the right with orange roof on top, a red arch, yellow horizontal block, and green vertical pillars\n\n2. The block dictionary image shows 16 different blocks with indices 1-16:\n   1. Red arch block (like a cube with an arch cut out)\n   2. Red curved block\n   3. Blue cube\n   4. Green cube\n   5. Red cube\n   6. Yellow cube\n   7. Green vertical rectangular block/pillar\n   8. Green vertical rectangular block/pillar (appears similar to 7)\n   9. Green horizontal rectangular block\n   10. Green horizontal rectangular block (appears similar to 9)\n   11. Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n   12. Orange cube\n   13. Orange triangular roof piece\n   14. Orange triangular roof piece (different orientation)\n   15. Orange triangular roof piece (different orientation)\n   16. Orange triangular roof piece (different orientation)\n\nNow I'll analyze each structure in detail:\n\nLeft Structure (House with arch):\n- Base layer: Yellow cubes on sides (block 6), red arch block in middle (block 1)\n- Middle layer: Orange triangular roof pieces on the sides (likely blocks 13-16), red cube on the back (block 5)\n- Top layer: Green cube (block 4), blue cube (block 3), orange triangular roof pieces on top (likely blocks 13-16)\n\nRight Structure (Bridge):\n- Base: Two green vertical pillars (blocks 7 and 8)\n- Middle: Yellow horizontal block across the pillars (block 11)\n- Top: Red arch block (block 1) with orange triangular roof pieces on top (likely blocks 13-16)\n\nLet me count the total blocks used:\nLeft structure:\n- 2 yellow cubes (block 6)\n- 1 red arch block (block 1)\n- 1 red cube (block 5)\n- 1 green cube (block 4)\n- 1 blue cube (block 3)\n- 4 orange triangular roof pieces (blocks 13-16)\n\nRight structure:\n- 2 green vertical pillars (blocks 7 and 8)\n- 1 yellow horizontal block (block 11)\n- 1 red arch block (block 1)\n- 2 orange triangular roof pieces (blocks 13-16)\n\nTotal: approximately 16 blocks, depending on exact roof configurations.\n\nNow I'll prepare the assembly instructions, starting from the bottom up:",

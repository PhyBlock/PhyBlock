      "thinking": "I need to analyze the provided images and come up with a detailed description of the target structure and the assembly instructions.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the main target image:\n\nThe main image shows a structure made of colored blocks:\n- The structure has 2 layers of blocks: \n  - Front layer: Red blocks with arches/semicircular cutouts (tunnel-like shapes)\n  - Back layer: Green rectangular blocks arranged vertically\n- There appear to be 6 blocks total:\n  - 2 red blocks with arches in the front\n  - 4 green rectangular blocks arranged vertically in the back\n\nThe structure looks like a small bridge or tunnel setup, with red blocks forming the tunnel/bridge and green blocks forming a wall behind it.\n\nNow let me analyze the block dictionary:\nThe dictionary shows 14 different blocks with indices 1-14:\n- Blocks 1-8 are red with various shapes and orientations\n- Blocks 9-14 are green with various shapes and orientations\n\nLooking specifically at the blocks in the main structure:\n- The red blocks in the front have arch/tunnel shapes - these look like blocks 1 and 2 from the dictionary\n- The green blocks in the back are vertical rectangular blocks - these look like blocks 11, 12, 13, and 14\n\nLet me match the exact blocks for the structure:\n- Front layer (red blocks with arches): Blocks 1 and 2 from the dictionary\n- Back layer (green vertical blocks): For the 4 vertical green blocks, I need to select from blocks 11, 12, 13, and 14. \n  Looking more carefully, blocks 11 and 12 are taller vertical green blocks, while 13 and 14 are shorter/wider green blocks. \n  Based on the target image, the green blocks appear to be of equal height, and they look like blocks 11 and 12.\n\nFor the assembly order, I'll start with the back row (green blocks) and then add the front row (red blocks) since that makes a stable structure:\n\n1. Place the first green block (from left)\n2. Place the second green block\n3. Place the third green block\n4. Place the fourth green block\n5. Place the left red arch block\n6. Place the right red arch block\n\nNow, let me refine my analysis to be precise about which block indices to use:\n\nLooking carefully at the green blocks in the back row, they all appear to be identical - they look like vertical rectangular blocks. Based on the block dictionary, blocks 11 and 12 are vertical green blocks that match what we see in the target image. Since we need 4 green blocks and there are only 2 options (11 and 12), we'll need to use each block twice.\n\nFor the red blocks, looking at blocks 1 and 2 in the dictionary, they are arch blocks that match the front row in our target structure. Block 1 has the arch opening on the left side, and block 2 has the arch opening on the right side.\n\nSo the precise assembly instructions would be:",

These two blocks placed side by side create the front tunnel structure.\n\nBlock 11 is a vertical green rectangular block, which matches the ones seen in the back row.\n\n# Assembly Instructions\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first creates the back wall with four identical green blocks, then places the two red arch blocks in front to complete the tunnel structure.",

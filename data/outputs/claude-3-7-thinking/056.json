      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to understand the structure and then select the appropriate blocks for assembly.\n\nMain Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure appears to be a colorful block construction that looks somewhat like a vehicle or bridge.\n- It has 2 layers:\n  - Bottom layer: Red arch blocks forming a bridge-like structure, with a yellow cube at the right end\n  - Top layer: Green, red, blue, and yellow cubes placed on top of the bottom layer\n\nLet me count the blocks:\n1. Bottom layer:\n   - 2 red arch blocks (forming the bridge with two arches)\n   - 1 yellow cube (at the right end of the bottom layer)\n2. Top layer:\n   - 1 green cube (left end)\n   - 1 red cube (next to green)\n   - 1 blue cube (next to red)\n   - 1 yellow cube (right end, sitting on the yellow cube from the bottom layer)\n\nTotal: 7 blocks in the structure.\n\nSpatial relationships:\n- The bottom layer forms the base with the two red arch blocks connected side by side\n- The yellow cube is placed to the right of the red arch blocks in the bottom layer\n- The top layer has 4 cubes placed in a row (green, red, blue, yellow) from left to right\n- The top layer cubes sit directly on top of the bottom layer pieces\n\nNow, let me identify the specific blocks from the dictionary:\n\nFrom the block dictionary:\n1. Red arch block (left side view)\n2. Red arch block (right side view)\n3-8. Various red arch/curved blocks with different orientations\n9. Blue cube\n10. Green cube\n12. Red cube\n13. Yellow cube\n\nLooking at the main structure, I need:\n- For the bottom layer:\n  * Red arch block with orientation matching #1 (left arch)\n  * Red arch block with orientation matching #2 (right arch)\n  * Yellow cube (#13)\n- For the top layer:\n  * Green cube (#10)\n  * Red cube (#12)\n  * Blue cube (#9)\n  * Yellow cube (#13) again\n\nSo I need blocks #1, #2, #9, #10, #12, and #13 (with #13 used twice).\n\nAssembly order:\nI'll start with the bottom layer from left to right, then build the top layer from left to right.",

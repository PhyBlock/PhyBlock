First image (Main Target Image): \nThis shows a structure that appears to have:\n- A green square block on top (appears to be center top)\n- Blue blocks that form a T-shape\n- Orange triangular/wedge-shaped blocks on the sides\n\n2. Second image (Block Dictionary):\nThis shows 16 different building blocks with indices from 1-16:\n1. Blue cube\n2. Green cube\n3. Orange cube\n4. Yellow cube\n5. Blue rectangular block (horizontal)\n6. Blue rectangular block (vertical)\n7. Blue rectangular block (vertical)\n8. Orange rectangular block (horizontal)\n9. Orange thin vertical block\n10. Orange cube\n11. Orange triangular/wedge block (angled left)\n12. Orange triangular/wedge block (angled right)\n13. Orange triangular/wedge block (angled back)\n14. Orange triangular/wedge block (angled left)\n15. Orange triangular/wedge block (angled right)\n16. Orange triangular/wedge block (angled forward)\n\nLooking at the main target image more carefully, I can see:\n- There are multiple orange triangular blocks (wedges) forming an outer \"shell\"\n- A blue T-shaped structure in the middle\n- A green block on top of the blue T structure\n\nLet me count the total blocks and determine the layers:\n1. Base layer: Orange triangular blocks/wedges forming a symmetric pattern\n2. Middle layer: Blue blocks forming a T-shape\n3. Top layer: Green square block\n\nNow let me match the specific blocks from the dictionary needed to create this structure:",

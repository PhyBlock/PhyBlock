      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to construct the structures shown.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the main target image:\n- There are two separate structures on a dark blue checkered background\n- Left structure: Appears to be a red hollow block with yellow blocks on top and bottom\n- Right structure: Appears to be a structure with green sides, red and blue center pieces, and yellow blocks on top and bottom\n\nNow, let me identify the specific blocks from the dictionary:\n\nBlock Dictionary Analysis:\n1. Red arch block (left opening)\n2. Red arch block (right opening)\n3. Red curved block (left side)\n4. Red curved block (right side)\n5. Red C-shaped block\n6. Red vertical rectangular block\n7. Blue cube\n8. Red cube\n9. Green horizontal flat block\n10. Green horizontal flat block (appears similar to 9)\n11. Green vertical rectangular block\n12. Green vertical rectangular block (appears similar to 11)\n13. Yellow horizontal flat block\n14. Yellow horizontal flat block (appears similar to 13)\n15. Yellow vertical rectangular block\n16. Yellow vertical rectangular block (appears similar to 15)\n\nNow I'll analyze the structures in detail:\n\nLeft Structure:\n- Bottom: A yellow horizontal block (like #13 or #14)\n- Middle: Two red blocks that form a circular hole: appears to be blocks #1 and #2 placed side by side\n- Top: A yellow horizontal block (like #13 or #14)\n\nRight Structure:\n- Bottom: A yellow horizontal block (like #13 or #14)\n- Middle part consists of:\n  - Two green vertical blocks on the sides (like #11 or #12)\n  - A red block in the upper center (like #8)\n  - A blue block in the lower center (like #7)\n- Top: A yellow horizontal block (like #13 or #14)\n\nLet me now determine the exact blocks and assembly order.",

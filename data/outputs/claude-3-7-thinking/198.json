      "thinking": "I need to analyze both images carefully. The first image shows the target structure I need to build, and the second image is the block dictionary showing all the available blocks with their indices.\n\nIn the target image, I can see two distinct structures:\n\n1. Left Structure:\n   - A green rectangular block on top\n   - A red block with a curved cutout in the middle\n   - A green block on the left bottom\n   - A blue block on the right bottom\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - An orange triangular/pyramid-like block on top\n   - A green rectangular block beneath it\n   - A blue cube-like block in the middle\n   - A red curved/wavy block at the bottom (looks like it has two curved cutouts)\n\nNow, let me examine the block dictionary to identify the correct blocks by their indices:\n\nFor the left structure:\n- Green rectangular block on top: Looks like block #8 or #12\n- Red block with cutout: Appears to be block #3\n- Green block bottom left: Likely block #5\n- Blue block bottom right: Matches block #4\n\nFor the right structure:\n- Orange triangular top: Appears to be block #14 or #15\n- Green rectangular block: Matches block #8 or #12\n- Blue cube-like block: Block #4\n- Red curved bottom piece: Looks like block #2\n\nLet me verify these matches more carefully:\n- The green top block in the left structure appears to be horizontal, so it's likely #8 or #12\n- The green block on the right structure also appears to be horizontal, so similar to the previous one\n- The green cube in the bottom left of the left structure is #5\n- The blue cubes in both structures appear to be #4\n- The curved red block in the left structure is #3\n- The curved red block in the right structure with two cutouts is #2\n- The orange triangular top piece looks most like #14\n\nLet me finalize my block selections and determine the assembly order:",

      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and the block dictionary image to determine how to construct the structure shown in the main image.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the main target image:\n- The structure appears to be a rectangular prism with green blocks at the top and bottom, and yellow blocks in the middle.\n- It looks like a tower-like structure standing vertically.\n- There seem to be 2 green horizontal blocks (one at the top and one at the bottom) and 2 yellow vertical blocks in the middle.\n\nFrom a count perspective:\n- Total blocks: 4 (2 green, 2 yellow)\n- Layers: 3 distinct layers (green top, yellow middle, green bottom)\n\nNow, let's look at the block dictionary to identify the correct blocks:\n\nThe dictionary shows various blocks with different colors, shapes, and orientations:\n- Blocks 1, 2, 5, 6: Green rectangular blocks in different orientations\n- Blocks 3, 4: Green vertical blocks\n- Blocks 7, 8, 11, 12: Yellow rectangular blocks in different orientations\n- Blocks 9, 10: Yellow vertical blocks\n\nFor the structure in the main image, I need:\n1. A green horizontal block for the top - looks like block 1 or 2\n2. Yellow vertical blocks for the middle section - looks like blocks 9 or 10\n3. A green horizontal block for the bottom - looks like block 1 or 2\n\nLet me examine more closely to determine the exact blocks needed:\n\nFor the top green block:\n- This appears to be a horizontal green block, similar to blocks 1 or 2.\n- Based on the orientation in the image, it looks like block 2.\n\nFor the middle yellow blocks:\n- These are vertical yellow blocks, similar to blocks 9 or 10.\n- Based on the orientation in the image, they appear to be block 9 and block 10 side by side.\n\nFor the bottom green block:\n- This appears to be a horizontal green block, similar to blocks 1 or 2.\n- Based on the orientation in the image, it looks like block 2.\n\nSo to construct the structure, I would need:\n- Block 2 (top)\n- Blocks 9 and 10 (middle)\n- Block 2 (bottom)\n\nFor the assembly order, I would start from the bottom and build up:\n1. Place block 2 horizontally as the base\n2. Place blocks 9 and 10 vertically on top of the base, side by side\n3. Place another block 2 horizontally on top of the vertical yellow blocks",

For the bottom layer: Block 2 (horizontal green rectangular block)\n2. For the middle layer: \n   - Block 9 (vertical yellow rectangular block)\n   - Block 10 (vertical yellow rectangular block)\n3.

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary image to construct the structure as requested.\n\nFirst, let's examine the main target image:\n- The structure appears to be made of red and yellow blocks\n- It has multiple layers\n- The red blocks form arches/tunnels\n- Yellow blocks are placed horizontally creating a middle layer\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure in more detail:\n\nThe structure seems to have 3 vertical layers:\n1. Bottom layer: Red blocks with arches/tunnels\n2. Middle layer: Yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally\n3. Top layer: Red rectangular blocks\n\nLet's count the blocks and identify them from the dictionary:\n\nBottom layer:\n- Two red blocks with arches (tunnel-like openings)\n- These appear to match blocks #1 and #2 from the dictionary\n\nMiddle layer:\n- There appear to be 2-3 yellow horizontal blocks\n- These look like blocks #9, #10, #13, or #14 from the dictionary (horizontal yellow rectangles)\n\nTop layer:\n- Two red rectangular blocks\n- These don't have tunnels and appear to be solid\n\nNow, I need to carefully identify which specific blocks are needed from the dictionary and their exact arrangement.\n\nBottom layer (from left to right):\n- On the left: A red block with an arch opening - appears to be block #1\n- On the right: A red block with an arch opening - appears to be block #2\n\nMiddle layer:\n- Yellow horizontal blocks that span across the structure - possibly blocks #9 and #10 or blocks #13 and #14\n\nTop layer (from left to right):\n- Two red rectangular blocks - these might be the reverse sides of blocks like #1 and #2, but without seeing the tunnel part\n\nLet me reconsider the blocks more carefully. The red blocks on top don't appear to have arches, so they're different from the bottom ones. Looking through the dictionary, I don't see solid red rectangular blocks. The blocks must be combinations of the ones shown.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- The bottom red blocks are definitely #1 and #2 (arched blocks)\n- The yellow middle layer appears to use blocks #9 and #10 (or possibly #13 and #14)\n- The top red blocks might be blocks #1 and #2 rotated 180 degrees so the arch part is facing away from our view\n\nLet me finalize my analysis:",

      "thinking": "Let me analyze both images carefully:\n\n1. Main Target Image: This shows a structure that resembles a stylized figure or character made of colored building blocks.\n\nComponents of the structure (from bottom to top):\n- Two green vertical rectangular blocks positioned parallel to each other (like legs)\n- A horizontal yellow rectangular block sitting across the top of the green blocks (like a seat or table)\n- An orange cylindrical block positioned vertically on top of the yellow block (like a torso or body)\n- A yellow curved/half-cylindrical block on top of the orange cylinder (like a hat or head)\n\nThe structure has 3 distinct layers:\n1. Green blocks (bottom layer)\n2. Yellow horizontal block (middle layer)\n3. Orange cylinder and yellow curved top (top layers)\n\nTotal blocks used: 5 blocks (2 green rectangles, 1 yellow rectangle, 1 orange cylinder, 1 yellow curved top)\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image: This shows 16 different blocks with indices from 1 to 16.\n\nNow, let me identify which blocks from the dictionary match those in the main image:\n\nFor the green vertical rectangular blocks (legs):\n- Looking at blocks 2, 3, and 5, they all appear to be green rectangular blocks but in different orientations.\n- The green blocks in the main image are vertical and appear to match block #2 and block #3 (they seem identical but might have slight differences in orientation)\n\nFor the yellow horizontal rectangular block (seat/table):\n- Looking at blocks 6, 7, and 9, they are yellow rectangular blocks in different orientations.\n- The yellow horizontal block in the main image appears to match block #7 (horizontal yellow rectangle)\n\nFor the orange cylindrical block (torso/body):\n- Looking at blocks 10 and 11, they are orange cylindrical blocks in different orientations.\n- The orange cylinder in the main image is vertical, matching block #10\n\nFor the yellow curved/half-cylindrical top (hat/head):\n- Looking at blocks 12, 15, and 16, they appear to be curved yellow blocks.\n- The yellow top in the main image appears to match block #12 (curved yellow top)\n\nNow, let me determine the assembly order, starting from the bottom up:\n1. Place the green vertical blocks (legs) first\n2. Place the yellow horizontal block (seat/table) on top of the green blocks\n3. Place the orange vertical cylinder (torso/body) on the yellow block\n4. Place the yellow curved top (hat/head) at the very top\n\nSo the selected blocks are: #2, #3, #7, #10, and #12.",

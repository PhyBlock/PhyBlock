Determine an assembly order\n\nFirst, let me analyze the main target image:\n\nThe structure consists of two main parts:\n1. Left part: A tower-like structure with red arches, orange triangular roofs, cylindrical orange pillars, and green rectangular supports\n2. Right part: A building-like structure with yellow rectangular top and bottom, green vertical supports, and red and blue square panels in the middle\n\nLet me count the blocks and identify their spatial relationships:\n\nLeft Part (Tower):\n- Green rectangular blocks forming vertical supports on both sides\n- Red arched block on top\n- Orange triangular blocks as roofs (one on top, one on the side)\n- Orange cylindrical pillars\n\nRight Part (Building):\n- Yellow rectangular blocks on top and bottom\n- Green rectangular blocks as vertical supports\n- Red square panel\n- Blue square panel\n\nNow, let me match these with the blocks from the dictionary image:\n\nBlock 1: Red arched block\nBlock 2: Red arched block (different orientation)\nBlock 3: Red arched block (vertical orientation)\nBlock 4: Blue square/cube\nBlock 5: Red square/cube\nBlock 6: Green horizontal rectangular block\nBlock 7: Green horizontal rectangular block (different orientation)\nBlock 8: Green vertical rectangular block\nBlock 9: Yellow horizontal rectangular block\nBlock 10: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (different orientation)\nBlock 11: Orange cylindrical block\nBlock 12: Orange rectangular block\nBlock 13: Orange triangular block\nBlock 14: Orange triangular block (different orientation)\nBlock 15: Orange triangular block (different orientation)\nBlock 16: Orange triangular block (different orientation)\n\nNow, let me determine which specific blocks are needed and in what order they should be assembled:",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\n## Count & Layers\nThe structure consists of two distinct sections with multiple blocks organized in several layers:\n\n1. Left Structure (Arch/Tower):\n   - Contains approximately 9 blocks\n   - Has 3 main layers: base layer with green blocks and orange cylinders, middle with red arch, top with orange triangular roof\n\n2. Right Structure (Building):\n   - Contains approximately 7 blocks\n   - Has 3 main layers: bottom yellow base, middle section with green supports and red/blue panels, top yellow rectangular block\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- Left Structure: Green rectangular blocks serve as outer supports, with orange cylindrical pillars between them. A red arch sits on top of these, crowned by an orange triangular roof. Additional orange triangular blocks are positioned at the sides.\n- Right Structure: Yellow rectangular blocks form the top and bottom. Green vertical blocks serve as corner supports, with red and blue square panels filling the space between them.\n- The two structures are connected by an orange triangular ramp in the middle area.\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Block 1: Red arch block (for the top of the left structure)\n2. Block 4: Blue cube (for the bottom panel in the right structure)\n3. Block 5: Red cube (for the top panel in the right structure)\n4. Block 6 & 7: Green horizontal blocks (for base supports)\n5. Block 8: Green vertical block (for the vertical supports of the right structure) - needed 4 times\n6. Block 9 & 10: Yellow horizontal blocks (for top and bottom of right structure)\n7. Block 11: Orange cylinder (for the pillars) - needed 2 times\n8. Block 13, 14, 15: Orange triangular blocks (for the roof and connecting ramp)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 5\n   Step8: Move block with index 4\n   Step9: Move block with index 9\n   Step10: Move block with index 6\n   Step11: Move block with index 7\n   Step12: Move block with index 11\n   Step13: Move block with index 11\n   Step14: Move block with index 1\n   Step15: Move block with index 13\n   Step16: Move block with index 15\n   Step17: Move block with index 14\n}\n```",

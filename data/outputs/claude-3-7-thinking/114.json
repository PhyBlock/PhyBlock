      "thinking": "Let me analyze the two images to complete this block construction task.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the main target image (the first image):\n- I can see a structure made of a blue cube in the center with two orange triangular prism shapes (wedges) on either side\n- The blue cube appears to be standing upright\n- One orange triangular prism is positioned to the left of the blue cube\n- A second orange triangular prism is positioned to the right of the blue cube\n- These appear to be on the same level (single layer construction)\n\nNow, let's analyze the block dictionary (the second image) which shows various blocks with indices from 1 to 15:\n1. Blue cube\n2. Green cube\n3. Orange cube\n4. Red cube\n5. Yellow cube\n6. Orange rectangular piece (standing vertically)\n7. Orange rectangular piece (lying flat)\n8. Orange thin piece (standing vertically)\n9. Orange cube \n10. Orange triangular prism (wedge) in one orientation\n11. Orange triangular prism (wedge) in a different orientation\n12. Orange triangular prism (wedge) in yet another orientation\n13. Orange triangular prism (wedge) in another orientation\n14. Orange triangular prism (wedge) in another orientation\n15. Orange triangular prism (wedge) in another orientation\n\nLooking at the main target structure, I need to identify:\n- For the blue cube in the center: Block #1 (blue cube)\n- For the orange triangular prisms on the sides: I need to check which of the orange wedges (blocks #10-15) match the orientations shown in the target image\n\nLooking at the target image again, I see:\n- The left orange wedge appears to match block #11\n- The right orange wedge appears to match block #15\n\nSo, the blocks I need are:\n- Block #1 (blue cube)\n- Block #11 (orange wedge)\n- Block #15 (orange wedge)\n\nFor the assembly order, I'll start from left to right:\n1. Place block #11 (left orange wedge)\n2. Place block #1 (blue cube) next to it\n3. Place block #15 (right orange wedge) next to the blue cube",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\nThe main target image shows a simple structure consisting of:\n- **Block Count**: 3 blocks total\n- **Layers**: 1 layer (all blocks are placed on the same base level)\n- **Spatial Relationship**: The structure has a blue cube in the center with two orange triangular prisms (wedges) on either side. The left orange wedge is positioned against the left side of the blue cube, while the right orange wedge is positioned against the right side of the blue cube.\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nAfter analyzing the block dictionary, I can identify the exact blocks needed:\n- Block #1: Blue cube (for the center)\n- Block #11: Orange triangular prism in specific orientation (for the left side)\n- Block #15: Orange triangular prism in different orientation (for the right side)\n\nThese blocks match the exact shapes, colors, and rotational orientations shown in the target structure without requiring any rotation.\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from left to right, placing the left wedge first, followed by the central blue cube, and finally the right wedge to complete the structure.",

      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and the block dictionary image to complete this task. Let me break this down systematically:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Main Target Image:\n\nThe target structure appears to be a small table or stand-like object with:\n- A base layer consisting of 4 orange cylindrical pillars (legs)\n- A middle layer of 2 yellow rectangular blocks placed side-by-side horizontally\n- A top layer with a vertical green rectangular block\n- A yellow semi-cylindrical cap on top of the green block\n\nTotal blocks: 8 blocks (4 orange cylinders, 2 yellow rectangles, 1 green rectangle, 1 yellow semi-cylinder)\nTotal layers: 3 layers (base, middle, top) + 1 cap\n\n### 2. Identify the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nLooking at the block dictionary image, I need to match each component of the target structure:\n\nFor the orange cylindrical pillars (legs):\n- These match block #10 (vertical orange cylinder)\n- Need 4 of these\n\nFor the yellow rectangular blocks in the middle:\n- These match blocks #5 or #6 (yellow horizontal rectangles)\n- Need 2 of these\n\nFor the green vertical block:\n- This matches block #2 (green vertical rectangle)\n- Need 1 of this\n\nFor the yellow semi-cylindrical cap:\n- This matches block #12 (yellow semi-cylinder)\n- Need 1 of this\n\n### 3. Determine Assembly Order:\n\nBased on the structure, a logical assembly order would be bottom-up:\n\n1. Place the 4 orange cylindrical pillars (block #10) as the base\n2. Place the 2 yellow rectangular blocks (block #5 or #6) on top of the pillars\n3. Place the green vertical rectangle (block #2) on top of the yellow rectangles\n4. Place the yellow semi-cylindrical cap (block #12) on top of the green rectangle\n\nNow, looking more carefully at the blocks #5 and #6, they appear to be the same yellow rectangle but in slightly different orientations. From the main image, it looks like we need block #6 for both yellow rectangles as they are placed side by side horizontally.",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\n## Count & Layers:\n- The structure consists of 8 building blocks total\n- There are 4 layers:\n  1. Base layer: 4 orange cylindrical pillars\n  2. Middle layer: 2 yellow rectangular blocks placed side-by-side\n  3. Upper layer: 1 green rectangular block (vertical orientation)\n  4. Top cap: 1 yellow semi-cylindrical cap\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The 4 orange cylindrical pillars form the base/legs and are arranged in a rectangular pattern\n- The 2 yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the orange pillars\n- The green rectangular block stands vertically in the center on top of the yellow rectangles\n- The yellow semi-cylindrical cap sits on top of the green block\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the main image, I need the following blocks:\n- Block #10: 4 pieces (orange vertical cylinders for the legs)\n- Block #6: 2 pieces (yellow horizontal rectangular blocks for the middle layer)\n- Block #2: 1 piece (green vertical rectangular block for the upper layer)\n- Block #12: 1 piece (yellow semi-cylindrical cap for the top)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, starting with the four legs, then adding the middle platform, the vertical post, and finally the decorative cap.",

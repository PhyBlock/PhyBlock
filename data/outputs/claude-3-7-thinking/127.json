      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images provided:\n\n1. Main Target Image (first image):\n   - This shows a structure made of various colored building blocks.\n   - Let me count the blocks and identify the layers from bottom to top:\n\nLayers and blocks:\n- Bottom layer: Yellow cube (appears to be a small cube similar to block #4)\n- Second layer: Red block with a semi-circular cutout (similar to block #1)\n- Third layer: Green horizontal rectangular block (appears similar to block #6 or #8)\n- Top layer: Two blue cubes side by side (appear similar to block #2)\n- There also appears to be orange triangular/wedge-shaped blocks on the side (similar to blocks #13-16)\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image (second image):\n   This contains 16 different blocks, each with an index number:\n   1: Red block with semi-circular cutout\n   2: Blue cube\n   3: Red cube\n   4: Yellow cube\n   5: Small green rectangular block\n   6: Longer green rectangular block (horizontal)\n   7: Vertical green rectangular block\n   8: Green rectangular block (similar to #6 but possibly different dimensions)\n   9: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n   10: Orange/red rectangular block (horizontal)\n   11: Orange/red thin vertical piece\n   12: Orange/red cube\n   13-16: Various orange/red triangular/wedge blocks in different orientations\n\nNow, let me identify which specific blocks from the dictionary are needed to create the structure in the main image:\n\nThe structure appears to have:\n- 1x Yellow cube (block #4) as the base\n- 1x Red block with cutout (block #1) above the yellow cube\n- 1x Green horizontal rectangular block (block #6) above the red block\n- 2x Blue cubes (block #2) on top of the green block\n- At least 1 orange triangular/wedge-shaped block (need to determine which of #13-16 matches)\n\nLooking more carefully at the triangular orange pieces, I can see what looks like block #15 and possibly another angled block.\n\nLet me determine the best assembly order:\n1. Start with the yellow cube base (block #4)\n2. Place the red block with cutout (block #1) on top\n3. Add the green horizontal rectangle (block #6)\n4. Place the two blue cubes (block #2) on top of the green block\n5. Add the orange triangular pieces (seems to include block #15)",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n## Count & Layers\nThe structure consists of 7 building blocks arranged in 4 layers:\n- Bottom layer: 1 yellow cube\n- Second layer: 1 red block with a semi-circular cutout\n- Third layer: 1 green horizontal rectangular block\n- Top layer: 2 blue cubes side by side\n- Side components: 2 orange triangular/wedge-shaped blocks attached to the right side\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The yellow cube forms the base at the bottom\n- The red block with cutout sits directly on top of the yellow cube\n- The green rectangular block is positioned horizontally on top of the red block\n- The two blue cubes sit side by side on top of the green block\n- One orange triangular block is positioned on the right side at the middle height\n- Another orange triangular block appears to be behind or beside the first orange block\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n- Block #4: Yellow cube (for the base)\n- Block #1: Red block with semi-circular cutout\n- Block #6: Green horizontal rectangular block\n- Block #2: Blue cube (needed twice)\n- Block #15: Orange triangular block (right-facing wedge)\n- Block #14: Orange triangular block (angled differently than #15)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 15\n    Step5: Move block with index 14\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds from the bottom up, starting with the foundation and working toward the top, with the side components added before the top layer to ensure proper structural integrity.",

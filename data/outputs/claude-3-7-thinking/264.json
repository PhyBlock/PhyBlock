      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to construct the structure. Let me start by analyzing both images.\n\n**Main Target Image:**\nThe main target image shows two structures:\n1. A small house-like structure on the left consisting of:\n   - A red arch block at the bottom\n   - A green rectangular block above it\n   - A blue cubic block on top\n   - An orange triangular roof piece at the very top\n\n2. A larger tunnel-like structure on the right consisting of:\n   - Two yellow rectangular blocks (top and bottom)\n   - Two green rectangular blocks (left and right sides)\n   - A red block with a circular hole in the center\n\n**Block Dictionary Image:**\nThe dictionary shows various blocks with indices 1-16:\n1. Red arch block facing forward\n2. Red arch block facing right\n3. Red curved block\n4. Red curved block (different orientation)\n5. Blue cube\n6. Red cube\n7. Green horizontal rectangle\n8. Green horizontal rectangle (appears slightly different than 7)\n9. Green vertical rectangle\n10. Green rectangle (different orientation than 9)\n11. Yellow horizontal rectangle\n12. Yellow horizontal rectangle (appears slightly different than 11)\n13. Orange block\n14. Orange triangular roof piece\n15. Orange triangular block\n16. Orange triangular block (different orientation)\n\nNow, let me identify the specific blocks needed for each structure:\n\n**For the house-like structure (left):**\n- Bottom: Red arch block (index 1)\n- Middle: Green horizontal rectangle (index 7 or 8)\n- Top: Blue cube (index 5)\n- Roof: Orange triangular roof piece (index 14)\n\n**For the tunnel-like structure (right):**\n- Top and bottom: Yellow horizontal rectangles (indices 11 and 12)\n- Left and right sides: Green vertical rectangles (index 9 or 10)\n- Center: Red block with circular hole (this appears to be index 2)\n\nNow I'll determine the assembly order for each structure, starting from the bottom and working up.",

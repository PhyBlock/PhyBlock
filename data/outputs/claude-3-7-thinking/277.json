      "thinking": "Let me analyze the Main Target Image and the Block Dictionary Image to complete this task.\n\n**Main Target Image:**\nThe main image shows two structures:\n1. On the left: A red cube with a circular hole through it. This appears to be made of two red blocks with half-circle cutouts that form a complete hole when stacked.\n2. On the right: A more complex structure that looks like a house with:\n   - A base made of a yellow rectangular block on top of a blue rectangular block\n   - A red structure on top of the yellow block that has an arch/tunnel\n   - An orange triangular roof piece\n\n**Block Count and Layers:**\nStructure 1 (Left):\n- 2 red blocks with half-circle cutouts (appears to be the same block stacked)\n- 2 layers total\n\nStructure 2 (Right - House):\n- 1 blue rectangular block at the bottom\n- 1 yellow rectangular block above the blue block\n- 1 red arch block on the yellow block \n- 2 orange triangular roof pieces\n- 3 layers total (blue base, yellow middle, red+orange top)\n\n**Now let me identify the specific blocks from the dictionary:**\n\nLooking at the Block Dictionary:\n- For the left structure, I need blocks that are red with half-circle cutouts. The blocks look like #1 and #2 from the dictionary.\n- For the right structure:\n  - The blue base looks like block #5\n  - The yellow middle piece appears to be block #6 or #9\n  - The red arch piece appears to be block #2\n  - The orange roof pieces appear to be blocks #10, #11, #13, #14, #15, or #16 (need to determine the exact ones)\n\nLooking more carefully at the structures:\n\nLeft structure (Red cube with hole):\n- It appears to use two of block #2 (red arch pieces) stacked on top of each other\n\nRight structure (House):\n- Blue base: Block #5 (blue rectangular block)\n- Yellow middle: Block #6 (yellow horizontal rectangular block)\n- Red arch: Block #2 (red arch piece)\n- Orange roof: Looking at the triangular pieces, I believe it's using blocks #13 and #14 (orange triangular pieces) to form the roof\n\nLet me verify and finalize my selections:\n\nFor the left structure:\n- 2× Block #2 (Red arch pieces)\n\nFor the right structure (House):\n- 1× Block #5 (Blue rectangular block) as the base\n- 1× Block #6 (Yellow horizontal rectangular block) as the middle\n- 1× Block #2 (Red arch piece) on top of the yellow block\n- 2× Orange triangular blocks for the roof - looks like blocks #13 and #14\n\nNow let me think about the assembly order:\n\nFor the left structure:\n1. Place the first Block #2 (red arch)\n2. Place the second Block #2 on top of the first one, rotated 180° to create a complete hole\n\nFor the right structure:\n1. Place Block #5 (blue rectangular block) as the base\n2. Place Block #6 (yellow rectangular block) on top of the blue block\n3. Place Block #2 (red arch) on top of the yellow block\n4. Place Block #13 (orange triangular piece) on one side of the roof\n5. Place Block #14 (orange triangular piece) on the other side of the roof\n\nLet me now format this as my final answer.",

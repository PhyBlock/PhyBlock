      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images provided:\n\n1. Main Target Image: \nThis is the structure we need to build. It appears to be a tower-like structure with yellow and red blocks.\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image:\nThis shows 14 different building blocks with indices from 1 to 14. Blocks 1-8 are red, and blocks 9-14 are yellow. They have different shapes and orientations.\n\nNow, let me analyze the main target structure in detail:\n\nThe structure appears to have 3 layers (from bottom to top):\n1. Bottom layer: Two red arch blocks with a yellow rectangular block on top of them\n2. Middle layer: A red block with a circular hole through it\n3. Top layer: A yellow rectangular block\n\nLooking more closely:\n- Bottom layer: There are two red arch-shaped blocks (similar to blocks 1 and 2 in the dictionary) with a yellow rectangular block (similar to block 9 or 10) connecting them on top.\n- Middle layer: There's a red block with a circular hole through it. This appears to be constructed from blocks 5, 6, 7, or 8, which show different orientations of a block with a curved cutout.\n- Top layer: There's a yellow rectangular block similar to block 9, 10, 13, or 14.\n\nNow, let me identify the specific blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\nBottom layer:\n- Left side: Block 1 (red arch block)\n- Right side: Block 2 (red arch block)\n- Connecting yellow block: Block 9 or 10 (horizontal yellow rectangular block) - Block 9 seems to be the correct orientation\n\nMiddle layer:\n- The red block with the circular hole appears to be constructed from two half-circular pieces. Looking at blocks 5-8, we would need two of these pieces that form a circular hole when placed together. It seems like blocks 5 and 7 would form this circular hole.\n\nTop layer:\n- Yellow rectangular block: This looks like block 9 or 10 again, with the same orientation as the one used in the bottom layer - so block 9.\n\nLet me double-check my analysis:\n1. Bottom layer: Block 1 (left), Block 2 (right), Block 9 (connecting on top)\n2. Middle layer: Block 5 and Block 7 (forming a circular hole)\n3. Top layer: Block 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n\nNow, let's determine the assembly order. Typically, we would build from the bottom up:\n\nStep 1: Place Block 1 (red arch block, left side)\nStep 2: Place Block 2 (red arch block, right side)\nStep 3: Place Block 9 (yellow rectangular block) on top of Blocks 1 and 2\nStep 4: Place Block 5 (red half-circular block) on the left side of the middle layer\nStep 5: Place Block 7 (red half-circular block) on the right side of the middle layer\nStep 6: Place Block 9 (yellow rectangular block) on top to complete the structure",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\nAfter examining the main target structure, I can see it consists of 6 building blocks arranged in 3 distinct layers:\n\n## Structure Description:\n- **Bottom Layer**: Two red arch blocks form the base, with semi-circular cutouts facing each other\n- **Middle Layer**: A yellow rectangular block spans across the two arches, and above it is a red block with a circular hole through it\n- **Top Layer**: A yellow rectangular block sits on top of the structure\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The two arch blocks in the base are parallel to each other\n- The middle yellow block bridges the two red arch blocks horizontally\n- The red block with the circular hole sits directly on top of the yellow horizontal block\n- The top yellow block is positioned centrally on the red block with the hole\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on careful examination of the structure and the available blocks in the dictionary, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. **Block 1**: Red arch block (left side of base)\n2. **Block 2**: Red arch block (right side of base)\n3. **Block 9**: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (middle layer connector)\n4. **Block 5**: Red block with semi-circular cutout (left side of middle red section)\n5. **Block 7**: Red block with semi-circular cutout (right side of middle red section)\n6. **Block 9**: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (top layer) - using this block a second time\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, ensuring proper stability throughout the construction process.",

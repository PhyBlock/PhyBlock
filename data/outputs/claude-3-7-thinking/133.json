      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary image to complete this task.\n\nIn the main target image, I see a structure made of colored blocks:\n- There are red blocks forming what looks like a bridge or archway structure at the bottom (with semi-circular cutouts)\n- Green rectangular/vertical blocks standing behind the bridge\n- Yellow tall rectangular blocks at the back\n\nLet's count the blocks and analyze the layers:\n\nThe structure appears to have two layers:\n1. Bottom layer: Red arch/bridge blocks (2 blocks side by side)\n2. Back layer: Green vertical blocks (2 blocks) and yellow vertical blocks (2 blocks)\n\nTotal number of blocks: 6 blocks\n\nNow let me identify the specific blocks from the dictionary:\n\nFor the red arch blocks at the bottom:\n- These look like blocks #1 and #2 from the dictionary - red arch blocks facing opposite directions to form a bridge with two arches\n\nFor the green vertical blocks:\n- These appear to be block #10 in the dictionary - vertical green rectangular blocks\n- There are 2 of these in the structure, one behind each arch\n\nFor the yellow vertical blocks:\n- These look like blocks #14 and #15 in the dictionary - tall yellow rectangular blocks\n- There are 2 of these in the structure, positioned behind the green blocks\n\nSpatial arrangement:\n- The red arch blocks (#1 and #2) are placed side by side in the front row\n- Behind the left red arch block is a green vertical block (#10)\n- Behind the right red arch block is another green vertical block (#10)\n- Behind the left green block is a yellow vertical block (#14 or #15)\n- Behind the right green block is another yellow vertical block (#14 or #15)\n\nAssembly order:\nI'll infer a logical assembly order, starting from the back row and moving forward:\n1. Place the two yellow blocks at the back\n2. Place the two green blocks in front of the yellow blocks\n3. Place the two red arch blocks in front to complete the structure",

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images provided:\n\n1. Main Target Image (First Image):\n   - The structure shows a 3D arrangement of building blocks.\n   - There are 4 blocks total:\n     - Two yellow cylindrical/half-cylindrical blocks (looks like two yellow arches placed side by side)\n     - One green cube\n     - One blue cube\n   - The yellow arched blocks are in the front\n   - The green cube is behind and to the left of the yellow blocks\n   - The blue cube is behind and to the right of the yellow blocks\n   - All blocks appear to be on the same level (single layer)\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image (Second Image):\n   - This shows 13 different building blocks with various shapes, colors, and orientations.\n   - Each is labeled with an index number (1-13).\n\nNow, I need to identify which blocks from the dictionary match those in the main image:\n\nFor the blue cube: Block #1 (blue cube)\nFor the green cube: Block #2 (green cube)\nFor the yellow arch-shaped blocks: These appear to be Block #6 and #7 (yellow semi-cylindrical pieces)\n\nThe assembly order would typically be from back to front, so I'd place the cubes first and then the arched blocks:\n\nAssembly Order:\n1. Green cube (Block #2)\n2. Blue cube (Block #1) \n3. Yellow arch piece on the left (Block #6)\n4. Yellow arch piece on the right (Block #7)\n\nLet me confirm these selections match the target image exactly in shape, color, and orientation.",

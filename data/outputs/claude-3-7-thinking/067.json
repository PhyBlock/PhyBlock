      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary:\n\n**Main Target Image Analysis:**\nThe first image shows a small house-like structure with the following components:\n- Base layer: Red blocks forming an arch or tunnel structure\n- Middle layer: Yellow semi-circular blocks on top of the red base\n- Top layer: An orange triangular roof piece\n\nBreaking this down by layers:\n1. Bottom layer: Red arch/tunnel structure (looks like block #1 from the dictionary)\n2. Middle layer: Two yellow semi-circular blocks side by side (likely blocks #6 and #7)\n3. Top layer: Orange triangular roof piece (looks like block #14 or #15)\n\nLet me count the total blocks: I see 1 red arch base, 2 yellow semi-circular blocks, and 1 orange triangular roof, so 4 blocks total.\n\nNow let me analyze the block dictionary to identify the exact blocks needed:\n\n**Block Dictionary Analysis:**\n1. Block #1: Red arch/tunnel piece (matches the base of our structure)\n2. Block #6: Yellow semi-circular block (matches one of the middle pieces)\n3. Block #7: Yellow semi-circular block (matches one of the middle pieces)\n4. Block #14 or #15: Orange triangular piece (matches the roof piece - need to determine which one)\n\nLooking more carefully at the roof piece in the main image and comparing with blocks #14 and #15, I believe block #15 is the correct match for the orientation of the triangular roof piece.\n\nSo the blocks needed are:\n- Block #1 (Red arch/tunnel)\n- Block #6 (Yellow semi-circular block)\n- Block #7 (Yellow semi-circular block)\n- Block #15 (Orange triangular roof)\n\nFor the assembly order, we would logically build from bottom to top:\n1. Place the red arch/tunnel (Block #1) as the foundation\n2. Place the two yellow semi-circular blocks (Blocks #6 and #7) side by side on top of the red arch\n3. Place the orange triangular roof piece (Block #15) on top of the yellow blocks\n\nConverting this to the requested format:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 15\n}\n```",

Block #1: Red arch/tunnel piece (for the base foundation)\n2. Block #6: Yellow half-cylinder block (left side of middle layer)\n3. Block #7: Yellow half-cylinder block (right side of middle layer)\n4. Block #15: Orange triangular roof piece (for the top layer)\n\n## Assembly Order:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence follows a logical bottom-to-top construction approach, starting with the foundation piece and building upward to complete the structure.",

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and block dictionary carefully to complete this task.\n\nFor the main target image (first image):\nI see a tower-like structure composed of several building blocks:\n\nFrom bottom to top:\n1. A yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation) at the base\n2. A red block with a circular hole through it\n3. A yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n4. Two orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically side by side\n5. A yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation) on top of the cylinders\n6. An orange triangular pyramid at the very top\n\nTo the right of the tower, there are additional blocks not part of the main structure:\n- Two yellow semi-circular/arch blocks\n- A green cube\n- A blue cube\n\nNow, I'll identify each block from the dictionary (second image) that matches those in the target structure:\n\nThe block dictionary shows:\n1. Red block with a circular hole (horizontal orientation)\n2. Red curved/U-shaped block\n3. Red block with a circular hole (vertical orientation)\n4. Blue cube\n5. Green cube\n6. Red cube\n7. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (thin)\n8. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (larger)\n9. Orange vertical cylinder\n10. Orange horizontal cylinder (tilted right)\n11. Orange horizontal cylinder (tilted left)\n12. Yellow small arch/semicircle\n13. Yellow small arch/semicircle (different orientation)\n14. Yellow small vertical cylinder\n15. Yellow small vertical rectangular block\n16. Orange triangular pyramid\n\nMatching blocks for the main structure:\n- Yellow rectangular horizontal blocks: Block #8 (appears 3 times in the structure)\n- Red block with circular hole (vertical orientation): Block #3\n- Orange vertical cylinders: Block #9 (appears twice side by side)\n- Orange triangular pyramid: Block #16\n\nFor the blocks to the right:\n- Yellow arch/semicircle blocks: Blocks #12 and #13\n- Green cube: Block #5\n- Blue cube: Block #4\n\nNow I can determine the assembly order from bottom to top:\n1. Start with the base yellow rectangular block (#8)\n2. Place the red block with hole (#3) on top\n3. Place another yellow rectangular block (#8) on top\n4. Place two orange vertical cylinders (#9) side by side on top\n5. Place the third yellow rectangular block (#8) on top\n6. Place the orange triangular pyramid (#16) at the very top\n\nThese blocks are not part of the main structure, but are shown separately:\n- Two yellow arch/semicircle blocks (#12 and #13)\n- Green cube (#5)\n- Blue cube (#4)",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n## Count & Layers\nThe target structure consists of 9 blocks arranged in 6 layers:\n- Layer 1 (bottom): 1 yellow rectangular block\n- Layer 2: 1 red block with a circular hole\n- Layer 3: 1 yellow rectangular block\n- Layer 4: 2 orange cylindrical blocks\n- Layer 5: 1 yellow rectangular block\n- Layer 6 (top): 1 orange triangular pyramid\n\nThere are 3 additional blocks separate from the main structure: a green cube, a blue cube, and 2 yellow semi-circular/arch blocks.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The structure forms a tower with three horizontal yellow rectangular blocks serving as platforms\n- The red block with a hole is positioned between the first and second yellow platforms\n- Two vertical orange cylinders stand side by side between the second and third yellow platforms\n- The orange triangular pyramid sits at the top of the structure\n- The separate blocks (green cube, blue cube, and yellow arches) are positioned to the right of the main structure\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n- Block #8: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (needed 3 times)\n- Block #3: Red block with circular hole\n- Block #9: Orange vertical cylinder (needed 2 times)\n- Block #16: Orange triangular pyramid\n- Block #5: Green cube\n- Block #4: Blue cube\n- Block #12: Yellow semi-circular/arch block\n- Block #13: Yellow semi-circular/arch block in different orientation\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 8\n  Step2: Move block with index 3\n  Step3: Move block with index 8\n  Step4: Move block with index 9\n  Step5: Move block with index 9\n  Step6: Move block with index 8\n  Step7: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nNote: The green cube (#5), blue cube (#4), and yellow arch blocks (#12 and #13) are shown separately and not part of the main tower structure.",

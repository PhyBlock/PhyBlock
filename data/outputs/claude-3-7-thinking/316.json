Main Target Image: This shows two structures made of colored building blocks:\n   - Structure 1 (left): A T-shaped structure with blue blocks in the center arranged in a T, with orange triangular/sloped blocks on the sides.\n   - Structure 2 (right): A more complex structure with multiple components:\n     - Base layer: Red tunnel/arch block in the center with yellow cubes on each side and orange triangular/sloped blocks on the corners\n     - Middle layer: Green and blue cubes\n     - Top layer: Orange triangular/sloped blocks forming a roof shape\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image: This shows 16 different building blocks with indices from 1 to 16:\n   - 1: Red arch/tunnel block (one half)\n   - 2: Red curved block\n   - 3: Red arch/tunnel block (one half, appears to be the other end)\n   - 4: Blue cube (larger)\n   - 5: Green cube\n   - 6: Yellow cube\n   - 7: Blue cube (smaller)\n   - 8: Blue rectangular block\n   - 9: Blue rectangular block in different orientation\n   - 10: Orange flat vertical piece\n   - 11: Orange cube\n   - 12: Orange triangular/sloped block\n   - 13: Orange triangular/sloped block (different orientation)\n   - 14: Orange triangular/sloped block (different orientation)\n   - 15: Orange triangular/sloped block (different orientation)\n   - 16: Orange triangular/sloped block (different orientation)\n\nNow, let me identify which blocks from the dictionary are needed for the structures in the main image:\n\nStructure 1 (T-shaped):\n- Blue T-shape appears to be made of blocks #8 and #9\n- Orange triangular parts appear to use blocks #13, #14, #15, #16\n\nStructure 2 (House-like):\n- Base layer: \n  - Red tunnel/arch appears to be blocks #1 and #3 together\n  - Yellow cubes on sides are block #6 (used twice)\n  - Orange triangular corners appear to be blocks #12, #13, #14, or #15\n- Middle layer: \n  - Green cube is block #5\n  - Blue cube is block #4\n- Top layer:\n  - Orange triangular roof parts appear to be blocks #12, #13, #14, or #15 in various orientations\n\nLet me determine the exact blocks and their assembly order:",

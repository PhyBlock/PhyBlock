Main Target Image:\nThis image shows two structures: \n- A smaller house-like structure on the left\n- A larger bridge/tunnel-like structure on the right\n\nLet me break down each structure:\n\nLeft Structure (Small House):\n- Bottom: Red arch block (tunnel-like)\n- Middle: Blue cube/rectangular block as the house body\n- Yellow half-cylinder on top of the red arch\n- Top: Orange/red triangular roof\n\nRight Structure (Bridge/Tunnel):\n- Bottom: Four red arch blocks (tunnel-like) arranged in a square pattern\n- Middle: Yellow rectangular blocks connecting the red arches horizontally\n- Top: Two red rectangular blocks with arch openings\n\n2. Block Dictionary:\nThe dictionary shows 16 different building blocks numbered 1-16:\n1. Red arch block facing one direction\n2. Red arch block facing opposite direction of #1\n3. Red block with curved cutout\n4. Red tall block with cutout\n5. Red block with curved cutout (different orientation than #3)\n6. Blue cube\n7. Red cube\n8. Yellow cube\n9. Yellow rectangular block (horizontally oriented)\n10. Yellow half-cylinder\n11. Yellow cylinder\n12. Yellow rectangular block (vertically oriented)\n13. Yellow triangular/wedge shape\n14. Orange/red wall or divider\n15. Orange/red triangular roof\n16. Orange/red triangular roof (different orientation than #15)\n\nNow I'll determine which blocks from the dictionary are needed for each structure and the assembly order:",

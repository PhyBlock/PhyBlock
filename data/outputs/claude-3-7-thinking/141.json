      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to construct the structure.\n\nFirst, looking at the main target image, I see a multi-layered structure consisting of several building blocks in different colors:\n\n1. At the bottom: red blocks that appear to form a base with a semicircular cutout\n2. Above that: a green rectangular block\n3. Above the green: a yellow rectangular block\n4. On top of the yellow block: several orange blocks including what appears to be a tall cylindrical block and some triangular/angled blocks\n\nNow let's analyze the block dictionary to identify the specific blocks needed:\n\nBlock 1: Red block with a semicircular cutout (horizontal orientation)\nBlock 2: Red block with a semicircular cutout (different orientation from Block 1)\nBlock 3: Red block with a semicircular cutout (vertical orientation)\nBlock 4: Green rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\nBlock 5: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\nBlock 6: Yellow rectangular block (longer, horizontal orientation)\nBlock 7: Orange cylindrical block (vertical orientation)\nBlock 8: Orange cylindrical block (horizontal orientation)\nBlock 9: Orange rectangular block\nBlock 10: Orange thin rectangular block\nBlock 11: Orange cube block\nBlock 12: Orange triangular block\nBlocks 13-16: Various orange triangular blocks in different orientations\n\nLooking at the main structure again to match with the dictionary:\n\n1. Base layer: It appears to use Block 3 (red vertical block with cutout) and possibly Block 1 or 2 for the other part\n2. Middle layer (green): Uses Block 4 (green horizontal rectangular block)\n3. Upper middle layer (yellow): Appears to use Block 6 (longer yellow rectangular block)\n4. Top layer (orange): Uses Block 7 (vertical orange cylinder) and several of the triangular blocks (possibly blocks 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16)\n\nLet me make a more precise identification and count the total number of blocks:\n\nBottom layer: \n- 1 Block 3 (red vertical with cutout)\n- 1 Block 1 (red horizontal with cutout)\n\nMiddle layers:\n- 1 Block 4 (green horizontal rectangle)\n- 1 Block 6 (yellow longer horizontal rectangle)\n\nTop layer:\n- 1 Block 7 (orange vertical cylinder)\n- 2-3 orange triangular blocks (need to determine the exact ones from blocks 12-16)\n- Possibly Block 11 (orange cube) or Block 9 (orange rectangle)\n\nLet me look more carefully at the orange triangular pieces on top. It looks like there's one triangular piece on the left side and one on the right side of the yellow base, plus potentially another piece at the back. From the perspective shown, I think these correspond to blocks 14 and 15, and possibly 12 or 13.\n\nFor the assembly order, I'll start from the bottom and work upward:",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\n## Structure Description:\nThe target image shows a structure with 8 building blocks arranged in 4 distinct layers:\n\n1. **Bottom Layer (Red)**: Two red blocks with semicircular cutouts forming a base\n2. **Second Layer (Green)**: A horizontal green rectangular block \n3. **Third Layer (Yellow)**: A horizontal yellow rectangular block\n4. **Top Layer (Orange)**: \n   - A vertical orange cylindrical block in the center\n   - Three orange triangular/wedge blocks arranged around the cylinder\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The red blocks form the foundation with their curved cutouts facing outward\n- The green block sits centered on the red base\n- The yellow block is placed on top of the green block\n- The orange cylinder rises vertically from the center of the yellow block\n- The orange triangular blocks are arranged around the cylinder on the yellow platform (left side, right side, and back)\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\n## Required Blocks:\n1. Block 1: Red block with semicircular cutout (horizontal orientation)\n2. Block 3: Red block with semicircular cutout (vertical orientation)\n3. Block 4: Green rectangular block\n4. Block 6: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal, longer)\n5. Block 7: Orange cylindrical block (vertical)\n6. Block 14: Orange triangular/wedge block (oriented right)\n7. Block 15: Orange triangular/wedge block (oriented left)\n8. Block 13: Orange triangular/wedge block (oriented backward)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 14\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly progresses from bottom to top, starting with the red base blocks, adding the green and yellow middle layers, positioning the triangular orange blocks on the yellow platform, and finally placing the vertical orange cylinder on top.",

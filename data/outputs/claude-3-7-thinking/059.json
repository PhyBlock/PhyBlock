      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to create a building block structure.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the main target image:\n\nThe structure has multiple layers with red and yellow blocks:\n- At the bottom: A red block with two arches (bridge-like)\n- Middle layer: A yellow rectangular block placed horizontally\n- Above that: Three red blocks stacked to form a structure with a circular hole in the middle\n- Top layer: A yellow rectangular block placed horizontally\n\nNow, let's identify the blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\nYellow blocks (4 visible in the dictionary):\n- Block 9: Horizontal yellow rectangular block\n- Block 10: Similar to 9 but slightly different angle\n- Block 13: Another horizontal yellow block \n- Block 14: Another horizontal yellow block\n- Blocks 11 and 12: Vertical yellow blocks\n\nRed blocks (8 visible in the dictionary):\n- Blocks 1-2: Red blocks with a single arch\n- Blocks 3-4: Red blocks with curved sections\n- Blocks 5-8: Red blocks with circular cutouts in different orientations\n\nLooking at the main structure:\n1. Bottom: A red block with two arches - I'll need to use two single-arch blocks (1 and 2)\n2. Above that: A horizontal yellow rectangular block - looks like block 9 or 10\n3. Middle: Red blocks with a circular hole - would use blocks from 5-8 to create the circular opening\n4. Top: A horizontal yellow rectangular block - similar to the one used in layer 2\n\nLet me map these specifically to the blocks needed:\n\nBottom layer:\n- Red block with two arches: This appears to be a combination of blocks 1 and 2 placed side by side\n\nMiddle layers:\n- Yellow horizontal block: Block 9 or 10\n- Red blocks with circular hole: This would require appropriate blocks from 5-8 to create the hole\n\nTop layer:\n- Yellow horizontal block: Block 9 or 10 (same as the other horizontal yellow block)\n\nLet me determine the exact assembly sequence:",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\n## Structure Description:\nThe target structure consists of 6 distinct building blocks arranged in 4 layers:\n\n1. Bottom layer (1st): A red block with two arches side by side\n2. Second layer: A horizontal yellow rectangular block\n3. Third layer (middle): Three red blocks that form a structure with a circular hole through it\n4. Top layer (4th): A horizontal yellow rectangular block\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The bottom red block serves as the base with two arches\n- The yellow rectangular block sits directly on top of the red base block\n- Three red blocks form the middle section with a circular hole (one block for the left side, one with the circular hole in the middle, and one for the right side)\n- Another yellow rectangular block caps the structure at the top\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Block 1: Red block with arch (left side of bottom layer)\n2. Block 2: Red block with arch (right side of bottom layer)\n3. Block 5: Red block with circular cutout (left side of middle section)\n4. Block 8: Red block with circular cutout (right side of middle section)\n5. Block 9: Horizontal yellow rectangular block (for 2nd layer)\n6. Block 9: Horizontal yellow rectangular block (repeated for top layer)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, first creating the base with arches, then adding the first yellow block, followed by the middle red section with the circular hole, and finally capping it with the top yellow block.",

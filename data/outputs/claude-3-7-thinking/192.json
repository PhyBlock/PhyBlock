      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and then select blocks from the dictionary to construct the structure. Let me break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the main target image:\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures:\n\nStructure 1 (Left):\n- Base: 4 orange cylindrical pillars (block #12)\n- Middle: Yellow rectangular blocks on top (horizontal, looks like blocks #8, #9, or #11)\n- Top: A green vertical block (looks like block #6) with a yellow semi-cylindrical cap (block #13)\n\nStructure 2 (Right):\n- Base: A blue cube (block #3) with a green rectangular block (block #7) next to it, with two yellow semi-cylindrical shapes (block #13) at the bottom\n- Middle: A yellow horizontal block (looks like block #8 or #11) across the top of the blue and green blocks\n- Upper middle: A red block with a semi-circular cutout (block #2)\n- Top: A green horizontal block (block #5 or #7) with an orange triangular block (block #15 or #16) on top\n\nNow I'll identify each specific block needed from the dictionary:\n\nFor Structure 1 (Left):\n1. Four orange cylinders (Block #12) - base pillars\n2. Two or three yellow horizontal blocks (Block #8 or #11) - platform\n3. One green vertical block (Block #6) - vertical pillar\n4. One yellow semi-cylindrical cap (Block #13) - top cap\n\nFor Structure 2 (Right):\n1. One blue cube (Block #3) - base left\n2. One green rectangular block (Block #7) - base right\n3. Two yellow semi-cylindrical blocks (Block #13) - bottom feet\n4. One yellow horizontal block (Block #8 or #11) - horizontal platform\n5. One red block with semi-circular cutout (Block #2) - middle piece\n6. One green horizontal block (Block #5) - top horizontal piece\n7. One orange triangular block (Block #15 or #16) - top triangular piece\n\nLet me now determine the assembly order by starting from the bottom and working upward for each structure.",

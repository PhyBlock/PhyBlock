      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and then select the appropriate blocks from the dictionary to construct the structure. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the main target image (the first image):\n\nThe structure appears to be a robot-like or animal-like figure with:\n- A top section that looks like a red box with two yellow curved/dome shapes on top (possibly resembling eyes or ears)\n- A middle section with various colored blocks (yellow, blue, green)\n- A tall orange cylindrical piece serving as the body/trunk\n- An orange triangular piece that might represent a tail or limb\n\nLet me count the blocks and layers:\n1. The structure has approximately 9-10 distinct blocks\n2. It appears to have 3 main layers:\n   - Top layer: Red block with yellow domes\n   - Middle layer: Collection of colored blocks (yellow, blue, green)\n   - Bottom layer: Orange cylinder and triangular piece\n\nNow let me analyze the block dictionary (the second image) and match each component:\n\nLooking at the blocks available in the dictionary:\n1. Red U-shaped block - appears to be the top part with a cut-out\n2. Red rectangular block with notch - not immediately visible in the structure\n3. Blue cube - visible in the middle section\n4. Yellow cube - visible in the middle section\n5. Green rectangular block (shorter) - might be part of the base\n6. Green rectangular block (longer) - visible at the bottom of the middle section\n7. Orange cylinder - clearly the main body/trunk\n8. Yellow dome/half-cylinder - two of these are on top of the red block\n9. Yellow cylinder (short) - not immediately visible in the structure\n10. Yellow rectangular block (thin) - not immediately visible\n11. Yellow rectangular block (wider) - might be in the middle section\n12. Orange rectangular block - not immediately visible\n13. Orange rectangular block (wider) - not immediately visible\n14. Orange thin piece - not immediately visible\n15. Orange triangular piece - appears to be the \"tail\" section\n16. Orange triangular prism - not immediately visible\n\nLet me match the blocks I can see in the target structure:\n- The top red section with a hole: Block #1\n- The blue cube in middle section: Block #3\n- The yellow cube in middle section: Block #4\n- The green long rectangular block at base: Block #6\n- The orange cylinder as main trunk: Block #7\n- The yellow domes on top (need two): Block #8 (used twice)\n- The orange triangular piece (tail): Block #15",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Target Structure\n\n## 1. Structure Description:\nThe target structure resembles a robot-like figure with multiple components and layers:\n\n- **Total Blocks Used**: 9 blocks\n- **Number of Layers**: 3 main layers\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- **Top Layer**: A red U-shaped block with two yellow dome pieces on top\n- **Middle Layer**: Contains a yellow cube and a blue cube side by side, positioned on a green rectangular block\n- **Base Layer**: Features an orange cylindrical block as the main \"body\", with an orange triangular piece to the left (like a tail)\n\n## 2. Required Blocks from Dictionary:\n\nLooking at the dictionary image, I've identified these blocks needed to build the structure:\n- Block #1: Red U-shaped block (for the top \"head\" section)\n- Block #3: Blue cube (for the middle section)\n- Block #4: Yellow cube (for the middle section)\n- Block #6: Green rectangular block (for supporting the cubes)\n- Block #7: Orange cylinder (for the main \"body\")\n- Block #8: Yellow dome/half-cylinder (used twice for the \"eyes\" on top)\n- Block #15: Orange triangular piece (for the \"tail\" section)\n\n## 3. Assembly Order:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds from the bottom up, starting with the cylindrical base and triangular tail, then adding the green platform, the colored cubes, the red head piece, and finally the two yellow domes on top.",

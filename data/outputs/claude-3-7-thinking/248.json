Blocks #1 and #2 (red arch blocks) - needed for the base structures\n2. Blocks #3 and #4 (red curved pieces) - needed for the left base structure\n3. Block #5 (blue cube) - for the left structure middle\n4. Block #7 and #8 (green rectangular blocks) - for both structures\n5. Block #11 (yellow rectangular block) - for the right structure\n6. Block #12 (orange cylinder) - for the right structure tower\n7. Blocks #14 and #15 (orange triangular roof pieces) - for topping both structures\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 4\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 5\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n   Step9: Move block with index 1\n   Step10: Move block with index 2\n   Step11: Move block with index 7\n   Step12: Move block with index 8\n   Step13: Move block with index 11\n   Step14: Move block with index 12\n   Step15: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the left structure first (steps 1-8), then the right structure (steps 9-15), working from bottom to top for each structure.",

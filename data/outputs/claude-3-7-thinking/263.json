      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and the block dictionary image to complete this task.\n\nIn the main target image, there are two distinct structures:\n1. A red house-like structure with an orange/red triangular roof and an arched doorway\n2. A larger structure that resembles a window or doorframe with yellow blocks at the top and bottom, green blocks on the sides, and red and blue rectangular blocks in the middle area\n\nLet me analyze the block dictionary image first to understand what blocks are available:\n\nBlock 1: Red arch-like block with an opening (appears to be part of the house structure)\nBlock 2: Red curved block (different orientation of an arch)\nBlock 3: Red curved block (similar to block 2 but different orientation)\nBlock 4: Blue cube\nBlock 5: Red cube\nBlock 6: Yellow cube\nBlock 7: Green horizontal rectangular block\nBlock 8: Green vertical rectangular block\nBlock 9: Yellow horizontal rectangular block\nBlock 10: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (appears similar to 9)\nBlock 11: Yellow vertical rectangular block\nBlock 12: Orange/red vertical thin block\nBlock 13-16: Various orange/red triangular pieces (appear to be roof pieces for the house structure)\n\nNow, let me analyze the main target image in detail:\n\n1. The house-like structure:\n   - It appears to use Block 1 as the base (red arch)\n   - The roof appears to be made of triangular pieces, likely combinations of blocks 13-16\n\n2. The window/doorframe structure:\n   - Yellow horizontal blocks at top and bottom (Blocks 9 or 10)\n   - Green vertical blocks on the sides (Block 8)\n   - Red rectangular piece in the upper middle\n   - Blue block (Block 4) in the lower middle\n\nLet me put together the assembly order for each structure.",

Left structure:\n   - Two red rectangular blocks with tunnel/arch shape (one on top of one another)\n   - Two blue cubes positioned in front of the tunnel/arch\n\n2. Right structure:\n   - Three orange cylindrical columns (two at the bottom, one extending to the top)\n   - An orange triangular/pyramidal shape at the very top\n   - Two yellow rectangular blocks arranged in an L-shape on the middle section\n\nNow, let me examine the block dictionary to identify the corresponding block indices:\n\nFor the left structure:\n- The red blocks with tunnel/arch would be block index #1 (top red block with arch) and #2 (bottom curved red block)\n- The blue cubes would be block index #3 (two of these)\n\nFor the right structure:\n- The orange cylindrical columns would be block index #8 (vertical orange cylinder) - three of these\n- The orange triangular top would be one of #13, #14, #15, or #16 (orange triangular shapes) - likely #13 based on orientation\n- The yellow rectangular blocks would be indices #5, #6, or #7 (yellow rectangular blocks in different orientations) - likely #5 and #6 based on their orientations in the structure\n\nNow let me count the total blocks and layers:\n- Total blocks: 2 red blocks + 2 blue blocks + 3 orange cylinders + 1 orange triangle + 2 yellow blocks = 10 blocks\n- Layers: The left structure has 2 layers (the red blocks stacked), and the right structure has at least 3 layers (base cylinders, yellow blocks, top cylinder, and triangle top) - so overall about 3-4 layers\n\nNow, let me determine the precise blocks needed from the dictionary and then create the assembly order:",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n## Structure Description:\nThe main target image displays two separate structures:\n\n1. **Left Structure:**\n   - Consists of two red rectangular blocks with a tunnel/archway running through them\n   - Two blue cube blocks positioned in front of the tunnel\n   - This forms a simple 2-layer arrangement\n\n2. **Right Structure:**\n   - Features three orange cylindrical columns (two at the base, one extending upward)\n   - An orange triangular/pyramidal top piece\n   - Two yellow rectangular blocks arranged in an L-shape jutting out from the central column\n   - This forms a more complex 3-layer tower-like structure\n\n## Total Count:\n- **Number of blocks:** 10 blocks total\n- **Number of layers:** 3 layers (considering vertical arrangement)\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on careful examination of the target structure and matching with blocks in the dictionary:\n\n1. For the left structure:\n   - Block #1: Red rectangular block with arch (top part)\n   - Block #2: Red curved block (bottom part)\n   - Block #3: Blue cube (used twice)\n\n2. For the right structure:\n   - Block #8: Orange vertical cylinder (used three times)\n   - Block #13: Orange triangular top piece\n   - Block #5: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (longer one)\n   - Block #6: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (shorter one)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 13\n   Step7: Move block with index 2\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 3\n   Step10: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first builds the right structure (cylindrical tower with yellow blocks and triangular top), then constructs the left structure (red arch blocks with blue cubes).",

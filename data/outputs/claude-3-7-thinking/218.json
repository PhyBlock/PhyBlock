      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images carefully to solve this task:\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures:\n\nStructure 1 (on the left):\n- A table-like structure with four orange cylindrical legs\n- A green rectangular top made of two green rectangular blocks placed side by side\n\nStructure 2 (on the right):\n- A more complex structure with:\n  - A vertical green rectangular block as a base\n  - A yellow cylindrical block attached to the side of the green block\n  - An orange horizontal cylindrical block placed on top of the green block\n\nLet me count the total blocks:\n- 4 orange cylindrical legs in structure 1\n- 2 green rectangular blocks on top of structure 1\n- 1 green rectangular block in structure 2\n- 1 yellow cylindrical block in structure 2\n- 1 orange horizontal cylindrical block in structure 2\nTotal: 9 blocks\n\nNow let me look at the block dictionary to identify the correct blocks needed:\n\nGreen blocks:\n- Block 1: Small horizontal green rectangular block\n- Block 2: Horizontal green rectangular block (longer)\n- Block 3: Vertical green rectangular block (tall)\n- Block 4: Horizontal green rectangular block (wide)\n- Block 5: Horizontal green rectangular block (similar to 2)\n\nOrange blocks:\n- Block 6: Vertical orange cylindrical block\n- Block 7: Horizontal orange cylindrical block (pointing left/right)\n- Block 8: Horizontal orange cylindrical block (pointing front/back)\n\nYellow blocks:\n- Block 9: Small yellow curved block\n- Block 10: Small yellow curved block (different orientation)\n- Block 11: Vertical yellow cylindrical block\n- Block 12: Vertical yellow cylindrical block (similar to 11)\n- Block 13: Vertical yellow rectangular block\n- Block 14: Vertical yellow rectangular block (different orientation)\n- Block 15: Small yellow curved block (different orientation)\n- Block 16: Small yellow curved block (different orientation)\n\nNow let me identify the specific blocks needed for each structure:\n\nStructure 1:\n- For the four orange cylindrical legs: Block 6 (x4)\n- For the green rectangular top: Appears to be Block 2 and Block 2 (or possibly Block 4 and Block 1)\nLooking closer, it appears to be two of Block 2 side by side\n\nStructure 2:\n- For the vertical green rectangular block: Block 3\n- For the yellow cylindrical block: Block 12\n- For the horizontal orange cylinder on top: Block 7\n\nTo determine the assembly order, we need to build from the bottom up:\n\nFor Structure 1:\n1. Place the four cylindrical legs (Block 6) first\n2. Place the two green rectangular blocks (Block 2) on top\n\nFor Structure 2:\n1. Place the vertical green block (Block 3) first\n2. Attach the yellow cylindrical block (Block 12) to the side\n3. Place the horizontal orange cylindrical block (Block 7) on top\n\nOverall assembly order would be:\n1. Place Structure 1 legs (Block 6 x4)\n2. Place Structure 1 top (Block 2 x2)\n3. Place Structure 2 base (Block 3)\n4. Attach Structure 2 side component (Block 12)\n5. Place Structure 2 top piece (Block 7)",

For Structure 1:\n   - 4× Block 6 (vertical orange cylindrical blocks for legs)\n   - 2× Block 2 (horizontal green rectangular blocks for top)\n\n2. For Structure 2:\n   - 1× Block 3 (vertical green rectangular block as base)\n   - 1× Block 12 (vertical yellow cylindrical block for side)\n   - 1× Block 7 (horizontal orange cylindrical block for top)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 2\n   Step7: Move block with index 3\n   Step8: Move block with index 12\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence first builds the table-like structure (left side) from bottom to top, then constructs the second structure (right side) also from bottom to top.",

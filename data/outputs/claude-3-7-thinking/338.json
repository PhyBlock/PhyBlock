      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image, identify the blocks it uses, and then determine the assembly order.\n\nLooking at the main target image (first image):\n1. I see a structure with several distinguishable components:\n   - A structure that looks like a small table or platform with orange cylindrical legs\n   - A green vertical piece with a yellow curved top\n   - A red wavy structure with a blue cube on it\n\nLet me count the blocks and analyze the structure layer by layer:\n\nBase/First Layer:\n- 3 orange cylindrical blocks (appear to be identical) - these match block #12 in the dictionary\n- 1 red wavy structure that has two curved sections - this appears to be made of blocks #2 and #3 combined\n\nSecond Layer:\n- 2 yellow rectangular blocks on top of the orange cylinders - these match block #10\n- 1 blue cube sitting on the red wavy structure - this matches block #4\n\nThird Layer:\n- 1 green vertical rectangular block on top of the yellow platform - this matches block #9\n\nFourth Layer:\n- 1 yellow curved piece on top of the green block - this matches block #13 or #14 (they look similar, but I believe it's #13 based on the curve)\n\nNow let me count the total blocks:\n- 3× orange cylinders (#12)\n- 2× yellow rectangles (#10)\n- 1× blue cube (#4)\n- 1× green vertical rectangle (#9)\n- 1× yellow curved piece (#13)\n- 1× red curved piece (#2)\n- 1× red curved piece with back (#3)\n\nThat's a total of 9 blocks.\n\nNow I'll determine the assembly order. Typically we build from the bottom up:\n\n1. First, place the red wavy structure (blocks #2 and #3)\n2. Place the three orange cylinders (#12) in position\n3. Place the blue cube (#4) on the red wavy structure\n4. Place the two yellow rectangles (#10) on top of the orange cylinders\n5. Place the green vertical rectangle (#9) on top of the yellow platform\n6. Place the yellow curved piece (#13) on top of the green block\n\nLet me formalize this into the required step-by-step format:",

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 20 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** The base layer consists of two red arch blocks (blocks 2), and one horizontally oriented yellow block (block 10).\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):**  One red arch block (block 1) and a yellow horizontally oriented block (block 9) are placed on the left side; two green blocks (blocks 5) are placed on top of the yellow and a single red block (block 2).\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):**  Two red blocks (block 1) on top of the yellow, and two green blocks (blocks 5) are placed on top of the yellow block and a single blue block (block 6), an orange trapezoid (block 15) block on top of the blue block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Block 1: (2 occurrences)\n*   Block 2: (3 occurrences)\n*   Block 5: (3 occurrences)\n*   Block 6: (1 occurrences)\n*   Block 9: (1 occurrences)\n*   Block 10: (1 occurrences)\n*   Block 15: (1 occurrences)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 5\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 5\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 1\n    Step12: Move block with index 6\n    Step13: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

The left structure has 3 layers. The right structure has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):**\n    *   The base layer consists of a red block with an arch shape and a red block with a rectangular prism shape.\n    *   The second layer consists of a yellow rectangular prism block resting on the red blocks, with two green rectangular prism blocks on top of the yellow block.\n    *   On top of the green blocks are a blue rectangular block and an orange triangular prism.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):**\n    *   The base layer consists of a yellow cylinder block.\n    *   The second layer consists of a green rectangular prism block standing on top of the yellow cylinder block.\n    *   The third layer consists of an orange cylinder block resting on top of the green block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Left Structure:**\n    *   Block 1 (Red Arch)\n    *   Block 1 (Red Arch)\n    *   Block 6 (Yellow rectangular prism)\n    *   Block 3 (Green rectangular prism)\n    *   Block 3 (Green rectangular prism)\n    *   Block 4 (Blue rectangular prism)\n    *   Block 14 (Orange triangular prism)\n*   **Right Structure:**\n    *   Block 10 (Yellow Cylinder)\n    *   Block 5 (Green rectangular prism)\n    *   Block 9 (Orange Cylinder)\n\n**3.

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The target structure consists of two separate sub-structures. The first one on the left has 7 blocks in 4 layers. The second one on the right has 4 blocks in 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n        *   A rectangular base (yellow, green, and green) rests on the ground.\n        *   An orange cylindrical block is placed in the middle of the base.\n        *   Another rectangular block (yellow, green, and green) sits atop the orange cylinder.\n        *   A red triangular block is inside the second rectangular block.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n        *   A rectangular block (yellow, green, and green) with a circular hole is set at the base.\n        *   A second rectangular block (yellow, green, and green) on top of the first block.\n        *   A red curved block is inside the blocks above.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1**\n    *   Block 4 (Green, Horizontal) x 2 (for the base)\n    *   Block 7 (Green, Horizontal) x 2 (for the top)\n    *   Block 8 (Yellow, Horizontal) x 2 (for the base and the top)\n    *   Block 10 (Orange, Cylinder) x 1\n    *   Block 15 (Red Triangle) x 1\n*   **Structure 2**\n    *   Block 4 (Green, Horizontal) x 2 (for the base)\n    *   Block 7 (Green, Horizontal) x 2 (for the top)\n    *   Block 8 (Yellow, Horizontal) x 2 (for the base and the top)\n    *   Block 3 (Red, Curved Block) x 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 4\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 8\n    Step13: Move block with index 7\n    Step14: Move block with index 7\n    Step15: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n"

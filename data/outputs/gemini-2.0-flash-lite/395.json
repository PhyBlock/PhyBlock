The first layer consists of a block with a circular cut-out, a yellow block on the top, and a yellow block on the bottom. The second layer consists of two vertical green blocks. The third layer consists of a yellow block. The last layer consists of an orange triangular block.\n    *   Component 2 (Right Side): This component consists of 3 blocks, including one yellow block on top, and two red curved blocks forming a base.\n    *   Component 3 (Additional Component): Contains 2 blocks and has 2 layers, an additional block, with an arc cut-out, and a horizontal yellow block on top.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   Component 1: The circular block and the rectangular block is centered on the top of the rectangular block and the yellow blocks frame the circular and rectangular block on the top and bottom. The two green blocks are stacked on top of the circular block. The yellow block is stacked on top of the green blocks and the triangular block is on top of the yellow block.\n        *   Component 2: The two curved red blocks form the base. The yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the curved red blocks.\n        *   Component 3: The block with the arc cut-out forms the base and the yellow block is on top.\n        *   The components are spaced apart from each other.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   Block Indices: 1, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 2, 13, 6\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 1\n        Step2: Move block with index 7\n        Step3: Move block with index 8\n        Step4: Move block with index 5\n        Step5: Move block with index 5\n        Step6: Move block with index 6\n        Step7: Move block with index 15\n        Step8: Move block with index 2\n        Step9: Move block with index 13\n        Step10: Move block with index 10\n    }\n"

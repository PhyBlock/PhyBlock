Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure has 10 blocks and 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of four orange blocks that form a cross shape. They have a slanted side at the center, pointing towards the middle of the structure.\n    *   The middle layer consists of four vertical blocks. There are two blue blocks placed between the orange blocks, connecting the bottom layer's slanted side. There are two red blocks also placed between the orange blocks, connecting the bottom layer's slanted side.\n    *   The top layer consists of a single green square block placed on top of the middle layer at the center of the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Block 1: Blue block (vertical)\n    *   Block 2: Green block (vertical)\n    *   Block 3: Red block (vertical)\n    *   Block 8: Orange block (slanted corner)\n    *   Block 14: Orange block (slanted corner)\n    *   Block 10: Orange block (slanted corner)\n    *   Block 16: Orange block (slanted corner)\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 8, 10, 14, 16, 8\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 16\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 3\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

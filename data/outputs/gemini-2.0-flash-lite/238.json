The first structure contains 8 blocks, and the second contains 9 blocks. The first structure appears to have three layers, and the second structure appears to have four layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Structure 1):**\n    *   There's a base layer consisting of a green trapezoid (bottom left), a red trapezoid (middle left), and a yellow square (middle).\n    *   On top of the yellow square is a blue square.\n    *   Next to the blue square and the red trapezoid is a green rectangle.\n    *   A cylinder is placed on top of the blue square.\n    *   A red arch sits atop the cylinder.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Structure 2):**\n    *   There are two orange trapezoids in the bottom layer, forming the \"base\" of an arch.\n    *   On the base, there's a blue square in the middle, a green square on the left, and an orange square on the right.\n    *   Above that, an orange trapezoid is placed on each side.\n    *   Finally, an orange triangle sits on top, forming the roof.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 16\n    *   Block 12\n    *   Block 7\n    *   Block 4\n    *   Block 8\n    *   Block 11\n    *   Block 2\n    *   Block 14\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 15\n    *   Block 4\n    *   Block 5\n    *   Block 12\n    *   Block 13\n    *   Block 16\n    *   Block 16\n    *   Block 14\n    *   Block 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 16\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n    Step11: Move block with index 4\n    Step12: Move block with index 5\n    Step13: Move block with index 12\n    Step14: Move block with index 13\n    Step15: Move block with index 16\n    Step16: Move block with index 14\n    Step17: Move block with index 14\n}\n"

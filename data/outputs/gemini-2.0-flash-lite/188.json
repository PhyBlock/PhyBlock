The first structure is composed of 7 blocks across 3 layers and the second structure consists of 5 blocks across 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   **Structure 1 (Chair-like):**\n        *   Two orange cylindrical blocks stand vertically, forming the legs.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinders (the seat).\n        *   Another orange cylindrical block is placed vertically on top of the yellow rectangular block (the back).\n        *   A yellow half-cylinder is placed on top of the orange cylinder (the head).\n\n    *   **Structure 2 (House-like):**\n        *   An orange cylindrical block is the base of the house.\n        *   Two orange triangular blocks are placed on either side of the cylinder.\n        *   Two blue rectangular blocks are placed on either side of the orange cylinder, below the orange triangle blocks.\n        *   An orange triangular block is the roof of the house.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Block Indices:\n    *   Structure 1:\n        *   Index 6 (orange cylinder) x 3\n        *   Index 3 (yellow rectangular block) x 1\n        *   Index 7 (yellow half-cylinder) x 1\n    *   Structure 2:\n        *   Index 6 (orange cylinder) x 1\n        *   Index 1 (blue block) x 2\n        *   Index 12 (orange triangle) x 2\n        *   Index 16 (orange triangle) x 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n    Step11: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is comprised of two main components:\n    *   The first component has 3 layers. The bottom layer consists of two arch blocks. The middle layer is a single yellow block. The top layer is a single orange triangular prism block, resting on top of a red triangular block (arched blocks).\n    *   The second component has 1 layer. A central green cube is surrounded by 4 orange block with the orange blocks joined by blue blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The first component is composed of blocks arranged in a stable, layered structure. The bottom arches support the top blocks.\n    *   The second component is a four-pointed star arrangement around a central cube.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n    *   Block 1 (Red Arch) x 2\n    *   Block 4 (Yellow Rectangular Prism) x 1\n    *   Block 11 (Orange Rectangular Prism) x 4\n    *   Block 10 (Orange Triangular Prism) x 1\n    *   Block 2 (Green Cube) x 1\n    *   Block 5 (Blue Cube) x 4\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 5\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 5\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n    Step11: Move block with index 11\n    Step12: Move block with index 11\n    Step13: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 19 blocks and has 5 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Layer 1 (Base): A red block with arch (index 2) is at the center, flanked by two red arch blocks (index 1) on either side.\n    *   Layer 2: A horizontal yellow block (index 6) sits above the right-most block with arch (index 1). A yellow block (index 9) and a green block (index 8) are placed to the left of the center arch block (index 2). There is also a red block with a curved face and an arc shape underneath (index 3) sits under a green block (index 8).\n    *   Layer 3: A green block (index 7) is stacked directly above the green block (index 8) and a yellow rectangular block (index 10) is on top of the green block (index 6). There is also a green block (index 7) on top of the curved red block (index 3).\n    *   Layer 4: Two blue cube blocks (index 4) are stacked on the green rectangular blocks (index 7), a yellow rectangular block (index 10) on top of the yellow rectangular block (index 10).\n    *   Layer 5: A rectangular orange block (index 15) is on top of the orange block (index 16).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   3 x Block with Arch (index 1)\n    *   1 x Block with Arch (index 2)\n    *   1 x Block with Arch (index 3)\n    *   2 x Blue cube (index 4)\n    *   2 x Green rectangular block (index 7)\n    *   1 x Green rectangular block (index 8)\n    *   1 x Yellow rectangular block (index 9)\n    *   2 x Yellow rectangular block (index 10)\n    *   1 x Rectangular Orange Block (index 15)\n    *   1 x Rectangular Orange Block (index 16)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 3\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 4\n    Step14: Move block with index 10\n    Step15: Move block with index 15\n    Step16: Move block with index 16\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 12 blocks and is arranged in a structure with varying layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There are two main structures. The left one is a \"horse\" with two cylinder legs (block 8), a yellow rectangular body (block 6), a cylinder neck (block 8), and a yellow curved top (block 10).\n    *   The right structure starts with two cylinder legs (block 8) with a yellow rectangular base (block 7) and another cylinder on top (block 8). On the yellow rectangle sits block 1 (red arch), and next to it a blue block (3). On top of the right side structure, are two orange cylinders (block 8) with an orange roof (block 16).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n    *   Block 8 (cylinder): x5\n    *   Block 6 (yellow rectangle): x1\n    *   Block 7 (yellow rectangle): x1\n    *   Block 10 (yellow curved): x1\n    *   Block 1 (red arch): x1\n    *   Block 3 (blue cube): x1\n    *   Block 16 (orange roof): x1\n*   **Total block needed:** 12\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 3\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 16\n}\n```"

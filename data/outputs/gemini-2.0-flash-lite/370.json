Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** There are 12 blocks in total and the structure consists of 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The structure is composed of two primary groups.\n    *   The first group has 3 blocks: two of block 2 and one block 10\n    *   The second group consists of 9 blocks: two block 2, block 10, block 5, block 6, block 14, block 1, block 3.\n    *   The first group consists of blocks that appear to form a simple bridge and the second appears to create a tower.\n    *   The base of each of the groups use block 2.\n    *   In the bridge group, block 10 is on top of two blocks 2.\n    *   In the tower group, blocks 2 support the structure. Block 5 sits on top of the blocks 2. Block 6 then sits on top of the block 5. The building has a roof formed by block 1 and block 14.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   Block 1, Block 2, Block 3, Block 5, Block 6, Block 10, Block 14\n*   Matching Criteria: Each of the chosen blocks is represented in the dictionary, matching the target structure in shape, color, and orientation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n"

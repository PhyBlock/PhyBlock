Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure consists of 12 blocks.\n    *   The structure has 4 distinct layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of two cylindrical orange blocks, and one yellow rectangular block on top of the cylindrical blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Consists of a green rectangular block that makes up the base of the structure.\n    *   **Layer 3:** Consists of two cylindrical orange blocks, and one yellow rectangular block on top of the cylindrical blocks.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top Layer):** Consists of one orange triangular block.\n    *   The remaining structure has two yellow rectangular blocks, with a rectangular block on top, and two cylindrical orange blocks in between.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:** Based on the target image, the following blocks are required:\n    *   Two cylindrical orange blocks (horizontal orientation) for Layer 1.\n    *   One yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation) for Layer 1.\n    *   Two cylindrical orange blocks (vertical orientation) for the core structure.\n    *   One green rectangular block (vertical orientation) for the base of the core structure.\n    *   Two yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal orientation) for the sides of the core structure.\n    *   One orange triangular block.\n*   **List Block Indices:**\n    *   Block 10 (Cylindrical Orange) - 4 times\n    *   Block 4 (Yellow Rectangular) - 3 times\n    *   Block 1 (Green Rectangular) - 1 time\n    *   Block 9 (Cylindrical Orange) - 2 times\n    *   Block 16 (Orange Triangular) - 1 time\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are selected based on their shape, color, and orientation as they appear in the dictionary. No rotations are needed or permitted.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 4\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

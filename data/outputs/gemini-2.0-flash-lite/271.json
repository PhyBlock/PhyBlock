The first structure has a total of 12 blocks, across 3 layers. The second structure has 3 blocks across 2 layers.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:**\n        *   Layer 1 (base): Consists of 4 orange blocks, with their angled faces facing outwards. They are arranged in a square layout, with the angled faces forming the edges of a wider square.\n        *   Layer 2: Consists of 4 blue blocks, placed on top of the orange base blocks. These blocks are oriented to connect to the inside face of the orange blocks below.\n        *   Layer 3 (top): Consists of 4 blocks total. 1 green block placed on top of the center blue block, with three orange blocks positioned on top of the remaining blue blocks.\n    *   **Structure 2:**\n        *   Layer 1 (base): Consists of one red block with an archway cut out of the center.\n        *   Layer 2 (top): Consists of two blocks; one red and one orange. The orange block is on top of the red block in the back, and the red block is placed on top of the base block in the front, leaning against the other blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Base Layer (4 blocks): Block Index 16\n    *   Second Layer (4 blocks): Block Index 7\n    *   Third Layer (1 block): Block Index 4\n    *   Third Layer (3 blocks): Block Index 11\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Base Layer (1 block): Block Index 1\n    *   Top Layer (1 block): Block Index 16\n    *   Top Layer (1 block): Block Index 11\n\n**3.

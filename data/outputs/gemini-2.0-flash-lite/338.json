One is a \"chair-like\" structure, and the other is a small block structure. The \"chair-like\" structure has 4 layers, while the small block structure has 2. There are a total of 11 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **\"Chair-like\" structure:**\n        *   Layer 1: Three orange cylindrical blocks form the base and are arranged in a triangular pattern.\n        *   Layer 2: A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the three cylindrical blocks. Another yellow block is placed adjacent to the first one.\n        *   Layer 3: A green rectangular block is placed vertically on top of the two yellow blocks.\n        *   Layer 4: A yellow semi-circular block is placed on top of the green block.\n    *   **Small block structure:**\n        *   Layer 1: One red block that has two indentations.\n        *   Layer 2: One blue block is placed on top of the red block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Based on the analysis, the following blocks are required:\n    *   Block Index 12 (Orange cylinder, x3)\n    *   Block Index 10 (Yellow horizontal rectangle, x2)\n    *   Block Index 9 (Green vertical rectangle, x1)\n    *   Block Index 14 (Yellow semi-circular block, x1)\n    *   Block Index 2 (Red indentation block, x1)\n    *   Block Index 4 (Blue cube, x1)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 4\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n   Step6: Move block with index 10\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n   Step9: Move block with index 14\n}\n"

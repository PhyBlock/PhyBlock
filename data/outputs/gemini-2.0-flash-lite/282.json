Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block Count: 8\n    *   Layers: 5\n    *   Spatial Relationships:\n        *   A green rectangular block (index 4) at the base.\n        *   An orange cylinder (index 9) is placed on top of it.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block (index 8) is on top of the cylinder.\n        *   A green open block (index 6) is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block (index 8), forming a hollow square.\n        *   A red triangle (index 12) is placed inside the open block (index 6).\n        *   A blue rectangular block (index 1) is placed on top of the open green block.\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block Count: 8\n    *   Layers: 3\n    *   Spatial Relationships:\n        *   Orange triangles (index 16) are placed with an equal distance, forming the base.\n        *   Blue blocks (index 2) are placed in between the triangles.\n        *   A orange cylinder (index 9) is on top of the blue blocks (index 2).\n        *   A red triangle (index 12) is on top of the orange cylinder (index 9).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Structure 1\n    *   Block 4 (Green Rectangle): 1\n    *   Block 9 (Orange Cylinder): 1\n    *   Block 8 (Yellow Rectangle): 1\n    *   Block 6 (Green Open Block): 1\n    *   Block 12 (Red Triangle): 1\n    *   Block 1 (Blue Rectangle): 1\n\n*   Structure 2\n    *   Block 16 (Orange Triangle): 4\n    *   Block 2 (Blue Rectangle): 2\n    *   Block 9 (Orange Cylinder): 1\n    *   Block 12 (Red Triangle): 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n    Step10: Move block with index 16\n    Step11: Move block with index 2\n    Step12: Move block with index 2\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n    Step14: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n"

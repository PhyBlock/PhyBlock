The structure has a maximum height of 3 layers and 1-2 layer heights for some structures.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n        *   A blue block is the base.\n        *   A red curved block is placed on the blue block.\n        *   A green block is attached to the red block.\n        *   A yellow block is placed on the green and red blocks.\n        *   An orange block is on the yellow blocks.\n        *   A red wedge-like block is on top.\n        *   An orange block on the yellow block.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n        *   A blue block is the base of the structure.\n        *   An orange wedge block is attached to the right of the blue block.\n        *   An orange cylinder block is placed on top of the blue block.\n        *   An orange wedge block is on the right of the cylinder.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Block Indices:\n    *   Block 4 (Blue cube)\n    *   Block 2 (Red Curved Block)\n    *   Block 5 (Green Cube)\n    *   Block 7 (Yellow Block)\n    *   Block 13 (Orange Block)\n    *   Block 16 (Orange Wedge Block)\n    *   Block 10 (Orange Cylinder Block)\n    *   Block 4 (Blue Cube)\n    *   Block 16 (Orange Wedge Block)\n\n**3.

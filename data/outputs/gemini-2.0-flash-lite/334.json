Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure uses at least 18 blocks, with some potentially hidden. It has three primary layers (plus the top of the house).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):**  The base consists of two groups.\n    *   Group 1 has: block 2 on top, an orange rectangular block, a yellow rectangular block, a vertical yellow block, and a green rectangular block.\n    *   Group 2 has: a blue block, a yellow block, a vertical yellow block, an orange rectangular block, and a green block.\n    *   **Layer 2:**\n    *   Group 1: Two of index 8 (yellow block), and a block 12 (yellow arch)\n    *   Group 2: Two columns made up of blocks 10 (orange cylinders) and blocks 7 (yellow long blocks). These stacks go vertical\n    *   **Layer 3:** Block 16 (orange house piece)\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   1 (red arch): x1\n    *   2 (red arch): x1\n    *   3 (red arch): x1\n    *   4 (blue cube): x1\n    *   5 (orange cube): x1\n    *   6 (green cube): x1\n    *   7 (yellow block): x3\n    *   8 (yellow block): x5\n    *   10 (orange cylinder): x4\n    *   11 (orange cylinder): x2\n    *   12 (yellow arch): x1\n    *   13 (yellow block): x1\n    *   14 (orange house piece): x1\n    *   15 (orange house piece): x1\n    *   16 (orange house piece): x1\n\n**3.

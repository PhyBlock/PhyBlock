Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:**\n    *   There are 16 blocks used in total across the two structures.\n    *   The first structure (on the left) has 5 layers.\n    *   The second structure (on the right) has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:**\n        *   A long orange cylinder forms the base layer.\n        *   Upon the base are three orange cylinders, adjacent to each other and parallel to the long orange cylinder.\n        *   A green rectangular block sits on the three cylinders.\n        *   A red rectangular block sits on the green one.\n        *   A blue cube sits on the red block.\n        *   An orange triangular prism sits on top of the blue cube.\n    *   **Structure 2:**\n        *   Two vertical orange cylinders are the base, each sitting apart from the other.\n        *   A yellow rectangular prism sits atop the orange cylinders.\n        *   A red block with a curve on the top sits on the yellow prism.\n        *   An orange triangular prism sits on top of the red curve.\n        *   Another orange triangular prism sits adjacent on the top of the red curve to form the roof.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 11 (long orange cylinder - 1 instance)\n    *   Block 10 (orange cylinder - 3 instances)\n    *   Block 6 (green rectangular block - 1 instance)\n    *   Block 4 (red block - 1 instance)\n    *   Block 3 (blue cube - 1 instance)\n    *   Block 16 (orange triangular prism - 1 instance)\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 10 (orange cylinder - 2 instance)\n    *   Block 8 (yellow rectangular prism - 1 instance)\n    *   Block 2 (red curved block - 1 instance)\n    *   Block 14 (orange triangular prism - 2 instance)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 2\n    Step13: Move block with index 14\n    Step14: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

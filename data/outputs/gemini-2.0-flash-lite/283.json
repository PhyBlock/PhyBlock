Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure has 15 blocks and 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Three blocks, with block 1 on the left, block 2 in the middle and block 3 on the right. Four orange cylinders form the base of the right structure.\n    *   Layer 2: Four green blocks are on top of the red blocks. The other structure has a yellow block.\n    *   Layer 3: Two yellow blocks are on top of the orange cylinders.\n    *   Layer 4: One yellow block is on top of the other yellow block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 14, 12, 12, 12, 12\n*   **Justification:**\n    *   Blocks 1, 2 and 3 are selected to build the first layer.\n    *   Four instances of block 4 are selected to complete the second layer.\n    *   Four instances of block 5 are needed to create the base for the giraffe.\n    *   Two instances of block 9 are required to complete the third layer.\n    *   Block 14 is needed to complete the fourth layer.\n    *   Four instances of block 12 are needed to make the giraffe legs.\n\n**3.

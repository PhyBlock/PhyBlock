Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure uses 15 blocks and is composed of 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Consists of 2 yellow rectangular blocks (indices 7 and 8), one on top of the other. Also contains an orange trapezoidal block (index 16) and an orange rectangular block (index 13).\n    *   **Layer 2:** Composed of three red arch blocks (index 2), one on top of each base layer yellow block and on top of the orange rectangular block from the base layer, one blue block on top of the top red arch block.\n    *   **Layer 3:** Contains two green rectangular blocks (index 6 and 4) and two blue cubes (index 3). The green blocks are stacked one on top of the other in the middle of the structure. The two blue cubes are placed on top of the green blocks.\n    *   **Layer 4:** Contains two red rectangular blocks (index 11 and 12) on top of the orange block (index 13) from layer 1. Also, contains an orange triangular block (index 14) on the side of block 11.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Identified Blocks:**\n    *   Block 2 (x3)\n    *   Block 3 (x2)\n    *   Block 4 (x1)\n    *   Block 6 (x1)\n    *   Block 7 (x1)\n    *   Block 8 (x1)\n    *   Block 11 (x1)\n    *   Block 12 (x1)\n    *   Block 13 (x1)\n    *   Block 14 (x1)\n    *   Block 16 (x1)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 11\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 3\n    Step14: Move block with index 3\n}\n```"

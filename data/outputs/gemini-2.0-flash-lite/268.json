A single yellow rectangular block sits directly on the yellow rectangular base block.\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): A small green rectangular block sits on top of one of the two green rectangular blocks. An orange cylindrical block sits on top of a green rectangular block. A yellow cylindrical block sits on top of a green rectangular block. An orange cylindrical block sits on top of another green rectangular block.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   Block Index 1: Red arch block, (x2)\n    *   Block Index 5: Green block, (x3)\n    *   Block Index 7: Yellow block, (x2)\n    *   Block Index 10: Orange cylinder block, (x2)\n    *   Block Index 13: Yellow block, (x1)\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    ```\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 1\n        Step2: Move block with index 1\n        Step3: Move block with index 7\n        Step4: Move block with index 5\n        Step5: Move block with index 7\n        Step6: Move block with index 5\n        Step7: Move block with index 5\n        Step8: Move block with index 13\n        Step9: Move block with index 10\n        Step10: Move block with index 10\n    }\n    ```"

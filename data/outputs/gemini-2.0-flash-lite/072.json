Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 9 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two orange cylindrical blocks, oriented horizontally, parallel to each other.\n    *   The second layer is composed of three blocks: a horizontal yellow rectangular block, two orange cylindrical blocks are placed on each side of the yellow block and aligned with the orange cylinders of the bottom layer.\n    *   The third layer contains three blocks: a blue square block and a red square block are stacked on top of the yellow block, and a yellow rectangular block is located between the blue and red blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Identify Needed Blocks:** Blocks 1, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14 are required\n*   **List Block Indices:**\n    *   1 (Blue square block)\n    *   4 (Red square block)\n    *   6 (Horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n    *   10 (Horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n    *   12 (Orange cylindrical block)\n    *   14 (Orange cylindrical block)\n    *   12 (Orange cylindrical block)\n    *   14 (Orange cylindrical block)\n\n**3.

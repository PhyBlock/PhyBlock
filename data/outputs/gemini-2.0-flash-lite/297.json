Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Required Blocks:**\n    *   Block 6 (Green rectangle, vertical) - for the outer blocks of the left structure and the upper block of the right structure.\n    *   Block 4 (Yellow rectangle, horizontal) - for the left inner block of the left structure.\n    *   Block 3 (Red cube) - for the middle of the left structure.\n    *   Block 1 (Blue cube) - for the middle of the left structure.\n    *   Block 14 (Orange cylinder) - for the lower structure.\n*   **Block Indices:** 6, 4, 3, 3, 1, 3, 6, 14, 14, 6\n\n**3.

The left part has 3 layers. The right part has 3 layers.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   **Left Structure:** The base layer consists of two blocks, one on the left and one on the right, the center of which is the color yellow. The second layer is on top, it has two red arched blocks, and another yellow block. The third layer is on the top of the second layer with two red arched blocks.\n        *   **Right Structure:** The base layer consists of two green, vertical rectangular blocks. A yellow horizontal block is placed on top of the two green vertical blocks, with an orange cylindrical block is placed on top of the yellow block, and a yellow rounded block is placed on the top of the orange cylinder.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   Left Structure\n        *   Block Index 6 (Green vertical rectangle): Need 2 blocks.\n        *   Block Index 8 (Yellow horizontal rectangle): Need 1 block.\n        *   Block Index 10 (Orange cylinder): Need 1 block.\n        *   Block Index 12 (Yellow Rounded): Need 1 block.\n        *   Block Index 2 (Red Arched): Need 2 blocks.\n        *   Block Index 7 (Yellow horizontal rectangle): Need 1 block.\n        *   Block Index 2 (Red Arched): Need 2 blocks.\n    *   Right Structure\n        *   Block Index 6 (Green vertical rectangle): Need 2 blocks.\n        *   Block Index 8 (Yellow horizontal rectangle): Need 1 block.\n        *   Block Index 10 (Orange cylinder): Need 1 block.\n        *   Block Index 12 (Yellow Rounded): Need 1 block.\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    ```\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 6\n        Step2: Move block with index 6\n        Step3: Move block with index 8\n        Step4: Move block with index 2\n        Step5: Move block with index 2\n        Step6: Move block with index 7\n        Step7: Move block with index 2\n        Step8: Move block with index 2\n        Step9: Move block with index 6\n        Step10: Move block with index 6\n        Step11: Move block with index 8\n        Step12: Move block with index 10\n        Step13: Move block with index 12\n    }\n    ```\n"

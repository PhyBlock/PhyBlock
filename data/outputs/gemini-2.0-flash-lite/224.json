The larger structure on the left uses 13 blocks and appears to have three layers. The structure on the right uses 4 blocks and also appears to have three layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:** The bottom layer of the left structure consists of three red arches (blocks 2). Above these arches, the middle layer is composed of a horizontal yellow block (block 10) and two yellow half-cylinder blocks (block 13). The top layer contains two yellow rectangular blocks (block 9) in the middle and one green rectangular block (block 7) on the right. There are two green rectangular blocks (block 8) supporting the yellow horizontal block at the top.\n    *   **Right Structure:** Two orange cylinders (block 11) form the bottom layer. On top of these cylinders, a green rectangular block (block 6) is placed. On top of the green rectangular block is an orange triangular block (block 16).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Block Indices: 2, 2, 2, 10, 13, 13, 9, 9, 7, 8, 8, 11, 11, 6, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n    Step12: Move block with index 11\n    Step13: Move block with index 11\n    Step14: Move block with index 6\n    Step15: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

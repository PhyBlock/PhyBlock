The \"chair\" has 7 blocks and the \"car\" has 6 blocks. Each object can be considered a separate structure. The chair has 4 layers, and the car has 3.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Chair:**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Two green vertical rectangular prisms as legs, placed parallel to each other.\n        *   Layer 2: A horizontal yellow rectangular prism connecting the two green legs.\n        *   Layer 3: A red rectangular prism positioned vertically.\n        *   Layer 4 (Top): A blue square.\n        *   Layer 5: A curved yellow block on top of the blue square.\n    *   **Car:**\n        *   Layer 1: Two orange cylinders arranged horizontally.\n        *   Layer 2: A yellow block placed horizontally on top of the cylinders.\n        *   Layer 3: A blue square placed on top of the yellow block.\n        *   Layer 4: A curved yellow block on top of the blue square.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Chair**\n    *   Block Index 4 (Green vertical prism) - need two blocks.\n    *   Block Index 6 (Horizontal Yellow prism) - need one block.\n    *   Block Index 3 (Red square prism) - need one block.\n    *   Block Index 1 (Blue square prism) - need one block.\n    *   Block Index 12 (Yellow curved block) - need one block.\n*   **Car**\n    *   Block Index 10 (Orange cylinder, horizontal orientation) - need two blocks.\n    *   Block Index 6 (Yellow rectangular prism) - need one block.\n    *   Block Index 1 (Blue square prism) - need one block.\n    *   Block Index 12 (Yellow curved block) - need one block.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 12\n}\n```"

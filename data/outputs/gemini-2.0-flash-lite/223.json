The first structure has 4 layers, with 1 block in the bottom layer, 1 block in the second layer, 2 blocks in the third layer, and 2 blocks in the fourth layer. The second structure has 3 layers, with 4 blocks in the bottom layer, 1 block in the second layer, and 2 blocks in the top layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The first structure (left side) has a long, horizontal orange cylinder as a base, a green rectangular block on top of the cylinder, a red block on top of the green block, a blue block on top of the red block, and an orange triangular prism on top of the blue block.\n    *   The second structure (right side) has four blocks (two blue and two orange) forming a square base, a single green block on top of the square base, and two orange triangular prisms on top of the green block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 10 (orange cylinder)\n    *   Block 7 (green rectangular block)\n    *   Block 4 (red cube)\n    *   Block 1 (blue cube)\n    *   Block 16 (orange triangular prism)\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 1 (blue cube)\n    *   Block 1 (blue cube)\n    *   Block 3 (orange cube)\n    *   Block 3 (orange cube)\n    *   Block 6 (green rectangular block)\n    *   Block 16 (orange triangular prism)\n    *   Block 16 (orange triangular prism)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 16\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 3\n    Step9: Move block with index 3\n    Step10: Move block with index 6\n    Step11: Move block with index 16\n    Step12: Move block with index 16\n}\n```"

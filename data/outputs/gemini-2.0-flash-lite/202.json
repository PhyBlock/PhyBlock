The structure on the left has 7 blocks and has 4 layers. The structure on the right has 5 blocks and 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):**\n    *   Layer 1: Two blocks of type 2 are placed next to each other.\n    *   Layer 2: A green block of type 8 is placed above the blocks in layer 1.\n    *   Layer 3: A yellow block of type 9 is placed on top of the green block. An orange block of type 14 is placed above the yellow block.\n    *   Layer 4: An orange cylinder of type 12 is placed on top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):**\n    *   Layer 1: Two blocks of type 2 are placed next to each other.\n    *   Layer 2: Three blocks of type 7 are placed on top of the blocks in layer 1.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Left Structure:**\n    *   Block 2 (x2)\n    *   Block 8 (x1)\n    *   Block 9 (x1)\n    *   Block 14 (x1)\n    *   Block 12 (x1)\n*   **Right Structure:**\n    *   Block 2 (x2)\n    *   Block 7 (x3)\n\n**3.

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The main target image shows two structures.\n    *   The first structure (on the left) has 7 blocks and 2 layers.\n    *   The second structure (on the right) has 10 blocks and 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (First Structure):**\n    *   The base layer consists of four blocks, with two orange angled blocks on the sides, and two blue rectangular blocks in the middle of those angled blocks.\n    *   The top layer consists of one green square block positioned on top of the two blue blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Second Structure):**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two blocks, one yellow block on the right and one red block containing a hole in the middle of the structure.\n    *   The second layer consists of four blocks: two orange blocks on the sides, one blue block on the top of the red block, and one red block that forms the lower part of the hole.\n    *   The third layer consists of three blocks: one green block, one orange block on the top-right corner, and one blue block on the top-left corner.\n    *   The top layer consists of one orange block, completing the roof of the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **First Structure:**\n    *   Block Index 12 (orange angled blocks) - used 2 times\n    *   Block Index 7 (blue block) - used 2 times\n    *   Block Index 5 (green block) - used 1 time\n*   **Second Structure:**\n    *   Block Index 2 (red block with hole) - used 1 time\n    *   Block Index 11 (orange block) - used 2 times\n    *   Block Index 4 (blue block) - used 2 times\n    *   Block Index 6 (yellow block) - used 1 time\n    *   Block Index 3 (red block for hole) - used 1 time\n    *   Block Index 5 (green block) - used 1 time\n\n**3.

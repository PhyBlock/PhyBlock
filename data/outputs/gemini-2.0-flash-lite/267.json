Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The target image shows a structure composed of 20 blocks, arranged in 4 layers:\n    *   Layer 1 (Base): Consists of 4 orange cylindrical blocks.\n    *   Layer 2: Consists of a yellow rectangular block.\n    *   Layer 3: Consists of 2 orange cylindrical blocks and an additional yellow cylindrical block on top.\n    *   Layer 4 (Head): A yellow curved block.\n    *   Also, a separate structure on the left side made up of 7 blocks.\n        *   2 orange rectangular blocks.\n        *   2 blue rectangular blocks.\n        *   1 green square block.\n        *   2 orange triangular blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The orange cylindrical blocks of Layer 1 are arranged as the legs of the main structure.\n    *   The yellow rectangular block of Layer 2 is placed on top of the four cylindrical blocks, forming a platform.\n    *   Two orange cylindrical blocks of Layer 3 are placed on the yellow platform and act as the neck.\n    *   The yellow cylindrical block is on top of the neck.\n    *   The yellow curved block forms the head.\n    *   The separate structure on the left seems to be assembled with the green square at the center and other orange, blue and yellow blocks around it.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Block 8 (Orange Cylinder): Used 6 times (for the legs and neck).\n    *   Block 6 (Yellow Rectangle): Used 1 time (for the platform).\n    *   Block 10 (Yellow Curve): Used 1 time (for the head).\n    *   Block 2 (Orange Cube): Used 2 times (for the base of the separate structure).\n    *   Block 5 (Blue Cube): Used 2 times (for the base of the separate structure).\n    *   Block 1 (Green Cube): Used 1 time (for the base of the separate structure).\n    *   Block 16 (Orange Triangle): Used 2 times (for the base of the separate structure).\n\n*   **Block Indices:** \\[8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 10, 2, 2, 5, 5, 1, 16, 16]\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 2\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n    Step12: Move block with index 5\n    Step13: Move block with index 1\n    Step14: Move block with index 16\n    Step15: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

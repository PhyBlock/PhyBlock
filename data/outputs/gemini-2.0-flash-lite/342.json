The structure on the left consists of 9 blocks across 2 layers, and the structure on the right consists of 5 blocks across 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**  The bottom layer of the structure consists of 5 orange cylindrical blocks. The top layer comprises four green rectangular blocks. The green blocks are placed horizontally, resting on top of the orange cylinders and aligned side by side.\n    *   **Right Structure:** The bottom layer consists of two yellow blocks, each connected to an adjacent green block. On top of those blocks is one yellow block that connects the two. The green blocks are vertical, and placed vertically between the top and bottom yellow blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Left Structure**\n    *   Orange Cylinders (x5): Block 13\n    *   Green Rectangular Blocks (x4): Block 2\n*   **Right Structure**\n    *   Green Vertical Blocks (x2): Block 4\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Blocks (x3): Block 8\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:**\n    *   13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8\n\n**3.

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** There are 13 blocks and 4 layers total across two separate structures. The left structure consists of 5 blocks and 3 layers and the right structure consists of 8 blocks and 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   The bottom layer consists of a red block, a yellow block, and a green block stacked on top of each other.\n        *   The second layer contains one green block above the yellow block.\n        *   The top layer is the orange roof, with a triangular shape.\n    *   **Right Structure:**\n        *   The bottom layer includes a blue block, a red block, and a yellow block.\n        *   The second layer consists of a yellow block above the blue block and a green block above the red block.\n        *   The top layer is the orange roof, with a triangular shape. There is a arch between the red and yellow blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Block Indices: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12.\n*   There are multiple instances of these blocks required.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 5\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 12\n    Step12: Move block with index 12\n    Step13: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n"

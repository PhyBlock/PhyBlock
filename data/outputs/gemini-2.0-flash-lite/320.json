Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The target image contains two distinct structures.\n    *   Structure 1 (Left): Uses 4 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    *   Structure 2 (Right): Uses 7 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Structure 1: A green \"U\" shape sits on top of a orange cylinder. Below the cylinder is a flat green base. All blocks are vertically aligned.\n    *   Structure 2: A red base is composed of two triangles and a rectangular block with a circular cut-out. Above this, are two orange blocks with one yellow curved block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 6: green vertically oriented rectangular block (x1)\n    *   Block 7: green vertically oriented rectangular block (x1)\n    *   Block 8: green horizontally oriented rectangular block (x1)\n    *   Block 9: Orange cylinder (x1)\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 1: Red curved block (x1)\n    *   Block 13: Orange triangle block (x1)\n    *   Block 14: Orange triangle block (x1)\n    *   Block 10: Yellow curved block (x1)\n    *   Block 15: Orange triangle block (x1)\n    *   Block 16: Orange triangle block (x1)\n    *   Block 1: Red curved block (x1)\n\n**3.

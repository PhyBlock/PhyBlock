Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** There are two separate structures in the target image. The first structure (left) has a total of 4 blocks arranged in 3 layers. The second structure (right) has a total of 6 blocks arranged in 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): A red, horizontally oriented block with an arch cutout on one side.\n        *   Layer 2 (Middle): A green, horizontally oriented block with an arch cutout on one side, resting on top of layer 1 and the lower portion of the block is yellow.\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): A red, horizontally oriented block with an arch cutout on one side, resting on top of layer 2.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Four orange trapezoidal blocks arranged around a central core forming a square base for the structure. Between these blocks are four blue square blocks that form the base.\n        *   Layer 2 (Middle): One orange cylindrical block positioned directly in the center of the base formed by the trapezoidal blocks, forming the core of the structure.\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): One orange triangular block, with the hypotenuse on the top, placed on top of the orange cylinder.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 2 (red arched block) - Used for the top and bottom layers\n    *   Block 10 (yellow arched block) - Used for the middle layer's yellow portion\n    *   Block 8 (green arched block) - Used for the middle layer's green portion\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 12 (orange trapezoidal block) - Used for the base\n    *   Block 4 (blue square block) - Used for the base\n    *   Block 9 (orange cylinder block) - Used for the middle layer\n    *   Block 16 (orange triangular block) - Used for the top layer\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 4\n    Step11: Move block with index 4\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n    Step14: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

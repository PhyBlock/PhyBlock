Structure 1(the \"Chair\") has 10 blocks arranged in 3 layers. Structure 2 (small one) has 5 blocks arranged in 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1 (Chair):**\n        *   Layer 1 (Base): Consists of 4 cylindrical blocks that are orange, standing vertically.\n        *   Layer 2 (Seat): A horizontal rectangular block that is yellow, resting on top of the cylinders.\n        *   Layer 3 (Back): A yellow horizontal rectangular block on top of the seat, and a green rectangular block on top of that. There is also a yellow block that is half-cylindrical that connects the seat and the back.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Small one):**\n        *   Layer 1: Two yellow half-cylindrical blocks.\n        *   Layer 2: Green cube block and a blue cube block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Chair):**\n    *   Block 13 (Orange cylindrical block): 4 blocks\n    *   Block 10 (Yellow horizontal rectangular block): 2 blocks\n    *   Block 7 (Green rectangular block): 1 block\n    *   Block 15 (Yellow Half-Cylindrical Block): 1 block\n\n*   **Structure 2 (Small one):**\n    *   Block 15 (Yellow Half-Cylindrical Block): 2 blocks\n    *   Block 2 (Green Cube block): 1 block\n    *   Block 1 (Blue Cube block): 1 block\n\n*   **Block Indices:** [13, 13, 13, 13, 10, 10, 7, 15, 15, 2, 1, 15, 15]\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 15\n    Step11: Move block with index 2\n    Step12: Move block with index 1\n    Step13: Move block with index 15\n    Step14: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

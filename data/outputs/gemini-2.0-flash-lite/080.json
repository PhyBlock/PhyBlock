Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 9 blocks arranged in 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Two green rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A red arched block sits on the base, centered between the rectangular blocks. Two orange blocks are positioned to the left and right of the arched block, on top of the base blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A green block is placed on the left orange block and a blue block is placed on the right orange block.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Roof):** Two orange triangular blocks form the roof, placed on top of the green and blue blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Block Index 9 (green rectangular block) - needs to be used twice for the base.\n    *   Block Index 2 (red arch block)\n    *   Block Index 16 (orange triangular block) - needs to be used twice for the roof.\n    *   Block Index 13 (orange rectangular block) - needs to be used twice for the side blocks on layer 2.\n    *   Block Index 8 (green cube block)\n    *   Block Index 7 (blue cube block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two structures.\n\nStructure 1 (Left):\n   -   Blocks: 8\n   -   Layers: 3\n   -   Spatial Relationships:\n        -   Layer 1 (Top): Two yellow rectangular blocks on the sides of the block in layer 2, with each oriented horizontally.\n        -   Layer 2 (Middle): Two green rectangular blocks on the side of the block in layer 2, with each oriented vertically. And in the middle the block with a red block on the top and blue block below.\n        -   Layer 3 (Bottom): Two yellow rectangular blocks on the sides of the block in layer 2, with each oriented horizontally.\n\nStructure 2 (Right):\n   -   Blocks: 11\n   -   Layers: 4\n   -   Spatial Relationships:\n        -   Layer 1 (Bottom): Four blocks in the bottom layer, with alternating colors green, red, green, and red, arranged in a 2x2 square.\n        -   Layer 2: Three blocks in the second layer. A red rectangular block on top of the second block in the first layer. and a blue block on top of the blocks on the left and right side of the bottom layer, which form the windows of the building.\n        -   Layer 3: Two blocks in the third layer. One on top of the blue blocks and the other on top of the red block.\n        -   Layer 4: Two orange triangular blocks forming the roof.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nStructure 1:\n    -   Block Index 9: x2 (yellow horizontal blocks)\n    -   Block Index 10: x2 (green vertical blocks)\n    -   Block Index 4: x1 (red block)\n    -   Block Index 6: x1 (blue block)\n\nStructure 2:\n    -   Block Index 1: x2 (blue blocks)\n    -   Block Index 2: x2 (green blocks)\n    -   Block Index 3: x1 (orange block)\n    -   Block Index 4: x2 (red blocks)\n    -   Block Index 14: x2 (orange triangular blocks)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 9\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 2\n    Step11: Move block with index 3\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 1\n    Step14: Move block with index 1\n    Step15: Move block with index 4\n    Step16: Move block with index 14\n    Step17: Move block with index 14\n}\n"

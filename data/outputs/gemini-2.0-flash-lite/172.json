Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The target image shows two structures.\n    *   Structure 1 (Truck): 7 blocks, consisting of 3 layers.\n    *   Structure 2 (House): 8 blocks, consisting of 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Structure 1 (Truck):\n        *   Layer 1: Two orange cylindrical blocks (wheels) are parallel to each other.\n        *   Layer 2: A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two orange cylinders, connecting them.\n        *   Layer 3: A blue block is placed on top of the yellow block, followed by an additional blue block.\n    *   Structure 2 (House):\n        *   Layer 1: Two green blocks are placed side by side on the bottom layer, with a red block above the green blocks.\n        *   Layer 2: A yellow block is centered on top of the two green blocks. Blue block is placed in either side of the yellow block.\n        *   Layer 3: Two orange triangular blocks form a roof on top of the other blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   Block 12 (two orange cylinders, for wheels)\n    *   Block 8 (yellow block, for truck)\n    *   Block 6 (two blue blocks, for the truck)\n    *   Block 2 (two green blocks, for the house)\n    *   Block 3 (red block, for the house)\n    *   Block 4 (yellow block, for the house)\n    *   Block 1 (blue block, for the house)\n    *   Block 14 (two orange triangular blocks, for the roof)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 3\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 1\n    Step12: Move block with index 14\n    Step13: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

There is also another block with the same shape as the first (index 2) but on its side.\n        *   **Layer 2:** On the arches of Layer 1, there are rectangular (index 12) and cuboid (index 8) blocks. Above the two cuboid blocks, there are two more cuboid blocks with a green color (index 9), a blue one (index 8), and another yellow one(index 11). Above the arch, there is a block with the same shape as the first (index 1) on the left, and a horizontal block (index 12) on the top.\n        *   **Layer 3:** On top of the structure on the left, a red arch block (index 2) is placed on top. Another yellow rectangular block (index 16) is placed on top of the red arch.\n        *   **Other parts:** The other part of the structure on the left has a combination of the same blocks in the previous layers (index 1, index 16, index 2, index 12).\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   Block Index List: [2, 10, 10, 2, 2, 12, 1, 9, 8, 11, 1, 12, 2, 16]\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    ```\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 2\n        Step2: Move block with index 10\n        Step3: Move block with index 10\n        Step4: Move block with index 2\n        Step5: Move block with index 2\n        Step6: Move block with index 12\n        Step7: Move block with index 1\n        Step8: Move block with index 9\n        Step9: Move block with index 8\n        Step10: Move block with index 11\n        Step11: Move block with index 1\n        Step12: Move block with index 12\n        Step13: Move block with index 2\n        Step14: Move block with index 16\n    }\n    ```\n"

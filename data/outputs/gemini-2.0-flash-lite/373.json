Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The target image shows two structures.\n    *   Structure 1: 3 layers (red base, yellow top, orange roof). A total of 7 blocks.\n    *   Structure 2: 4 layers (red base, green top, yellow middle, orange roof). A total of 6 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): One red block (block with a curve in dictionary).\n        *   Layer 2 (Middle): Two yellow blocks (horizontal rectangular). There is also a red block with a hole passing through.\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): Orange triangular block on top.\n        *   Two orange cylinders are placed on the layer 2 to create two separate stacks.\n    *   **Structure 2:**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): One red curved block (block with a curve in dictionary).\n        *   Layer 2: One green block is placed on top of the red block.\n        *   Layer 3: One yellow horizontal block.\n        *   Layer 4 (Top): One orange cylinder, and an orange triangular block on top.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 2: Red curved block (x1)\n    *   Block 9: Yellow horizontal block (x2)\n    *   Block 3: Red curved block with a hole (x1)\n    *   Block 11: Orange cylinder (x2)\n    *   Block 15: Orange triangular block (x1)\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 2: Red curved block (x1)\n    *   Block 8: Green vertical block (x1)\n    *   Block 9: Yellow horizontal block (x1)\n    *   Block 11: Orange cylinder (x1)\n    *   Block 15: Orange triangular block (x1)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 8\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 11\n    Step12: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

The first structure has 3 layers, and the second one has 2 layers. A total of 16 blocks appear to be used.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:**\n        *   Layer 1:  Two orange blocks, two yellow blocks, and one red block with a hole form a base.\n        *   Layer 2:  One red block, one green block, one blue block, and two orange blocks. The red block with a hole is located in this layer.\n        *   Layer 3:  Three orange blocks form a triangular roof.\n    *   **Structure 2:**\n        *   Layer 1: Two orange cylinders and one yellow block.\n        *   Layer 2:  One yellow block and one orange triangular block on top.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 13: 2 blocks are needed for the bottom layer on the left and right side.\n    *   Block 8: 2 blocks are needed for the bottom layer to support block 13.\n    *   Block 2: 1 block is needed for the bottom layer.\n    *   Block 1: 1 block is needed for layer 2.\n    *   Block 6: 1 block is needed for layer 2.\n    *   Block 5: 1 block is needed for layer 2.\n    *   Block 14: 1 block is needed for the top layer.\n    *   Block 14: 2 blocks are needed for the top layer.\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 9: 2 blocks are needed for the base.\n    *   Block 8: 1 block is needed for the top.\n    *   Block 16: 1 block is needed for the top.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n    Step11: Move block with index 14\n    Step12: Move block with index 9\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n    Step14: Move block with index 8\n    Step15: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

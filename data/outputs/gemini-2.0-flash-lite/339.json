Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure contains 11 blocks.\n    *   The structure has 3 layers, and the truck has 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Stack 1:** There is a stack of 4 blocks. The bottom layer is a red block (arch-shaped). Above it is a green rectangular block. Above it is a blue cube. On top is an orange triangle roof.\n    *   **Stack 2:** There are 2 blocks here. A orange cylindrical block and an orange triangular roof block.\n    *   **Truck:** The truck comprises of 5 blocks. On the base, are two orange cylinders acting as wheels. Above it is a yellow curved block (body). Above the body is a blue cube block (cab).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   Block 1: Red arch for the bottom of the stack\n    *   Block 6: Green rectangular block\n    *   Block 4: Blue cube\n    *   Block 13: Orange Triangle for roof\n    *   Block 9: Orange cylinder\n    *   Block 10: Orange cylinder (wheel)\n    *   Block 8: Yellow Curved Block for the Truck Body\n    *   Block 4: Blue Cube for Cab\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 13\n}\n```"

It is divided into 3 main groups:\n    *   Group 1: Archway - Composed of 7 blocks and 3 layers.\n    *   Group 2: Slanted Blocks and Cylinder - Composed of 6 blocks and 3 layers.\n    *   Group 3: Window frame - Composed of 3 blocks and 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Group 1 (Archway):**\n        *   Two rectangular blocks from blocks 6 and 7 make up the base.\n        *   Two cylinder blocks from block 11 form the pillars.\n        *   The arch is composed of block 2.\n        *   Block 13 fills in the space at the top left and block 15 at the top right.\n    *   **Group 2 (Slanted Blocks and Cylinder):**\n        *   Block 14 is placed at the base with a block 15 on the side.\n        *   Block 11 is placed on top of block 14.\n        *   Blocks 6, 16, and 13 are placed around the central cylinder and on the base blocks.\n    *   **Group 3 (Window Frame):**\n        *   Two vertical rectangular blocks from block 8.\n        *   One horizontal rectangular block from block 10.\n        *   Blocks 4, 5, and 4 within the frame.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Block 1: x 0\n*   Block 2: x 1\n*   Block 3: x 0\n*   Block 4: x 2\n*   Block 5: x 1\n*   Block 6: x 2\n*   Block 7: x 1\n*   Block 8: x 2\n*   Block 9: x 0\n*   Block 10: x 1\n*   Block 11: x 3\n*   Block 12: x 0\n*   Block 13: x 2\n*   Block 14: x 1\n*   Block 15: x 2\n*   Block 16: x 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 14\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n    Step11: Move block with index 16\n    Step12: Move block with index 13\n    Step13: Move block with index 2\n    Step14: Move block with index 8\n    Step15: Move block with index 8\n    Step16: Move block with index 10\n    Step17: Move block with index 4\n    Step18: Move block with index 5\n    Step19: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n"

The structure on the left uses 5 blocks and has 3 layers. The structure on the right uses 7 blocks and has 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):**\n    *   The bottom layer is made of red block with a curve on each side.\n    *   The second layer consists of a green block on top of the previous layer, with a blue cube in the center.\n    *   The third layer uses another red block with a curve on each side.\n    *   The blocks are stacked vertically. The blue cube rests inside the second layer, filling the cavity.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):**\n    *   The bottom layer is a vertical green block.\n    *   The second layer is a yellow block with a horizontal orientation on top of the green block.\n    *   The third layer has a red block with curves on each side.\n    *   The top layer is formed by orange blocks.\n    *   The blocks are stacked vertically.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Left Structure:**\n    *   Block 2 (red block with curves on each side): Index 2\n    *   Block 6 (green block): Index 6\n    *   Block 5 (blue cube): Index 5\n    *   Block 2 (red block with curves on each side): Index 2\n*   **Right Structure:**\n    *   Block 8 (vertical green block): Index 8\n    *   Block 10 (horizontal yellow block): Index 10\n    *   Block 3 (red block with curves on each side): Index 3\n    *   Block 14 (orange block): Index 14\n    *   Block 16 (orange block): Index 16\n*   **List of Block Indices:**\n    *   2, 6, 5, 2, 8, 10, 3, 14, 16\n\n**3.

Here's a detailed description and the necessary steps to construct them using the block dictionary:\n\n### Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\n**Left Structure:**\n- **Blocks Used:**\n  - Two red blocks, one at the top and one at the bottom, both featuring a cutout.\n  - Blue block in the center sandwiched between the red blocks.\n  - Green block in the center adjacent to the blue block.\n- **Layers and Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The red blocks form the outer layer in a vertical alignment.\n  - Blue and green blocks are in the middle horizontally, interlocking within the red blocks.\n\n**Right Structure:**\n- **Blocks Used:**\n  - Two red blocks, one at the top and one at the bottom, both featuring a cutout.\n  - Two blue blocks in the center, horizontally aligned and adjacent to each other.\n- **Layers and Spatial Relationships:**\n  - Similar to the left side structure, red blocks are on the outer part.\n  - The blue blocks are aligned adjacent to one another in the center.\n\n### Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\n1. **Red Blocks:**\n   - Use Block Index 5 twice for both the left and right structures in the vertical position.\n  \n2. **Blue Blocks:**\n   - Use Block Index 9 three times: twice for the right structure and once for the left structure, horizontally positioned.\n\n3. **Green Block:**\n   - Use Block Index 10 once for the left structure.\n\n### Assembly Instructions\n\n```plaintext\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5 (for the top of the left structure)\n   Step2: Move block with index 5 (for the bottom of the left structure)\n   Step3: Move block with index 9 (blue block for the left structure)\n   Step4: Move block with index 10 (green block for the left structure)\n   Step5: Move block with index 5 (for the top of the right structure)\n   Step6: Move block with index 5 (for the bottom of the right structure)\n   Step7: Move block with index 9 (first blue block for the right structure)\n   Step8: Move block with index 9 (second blue block for the right structure)\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures accurate recreation of the structures as shown in the target image.",

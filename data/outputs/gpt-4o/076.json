(Used twice for the top and bottom layers)\n\n2. **Green Blocks:**\n   - Selected block index for vertical green block: **9**. (Used twice for the sides in the middle layer)\n\n3. **Red Block:**\n   - Selected block index for red block with a circular hole: **5**. (Used once in the middle center)\n\n## Assembly Instructions:\n\n```plaintext\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13 (bottom layer)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (left middle layer)\n    Step3: Move block with index 5 (center middle layer)\n    Step4: Move block with index 9 (right middle layer)\n    Step5: Move block with index 13 (top layer)\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to align each block precisely as depicted in the target image without rotating any blocks from their given orientation in the dictionary.",

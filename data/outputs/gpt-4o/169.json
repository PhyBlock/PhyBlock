A blue cube is between the taller blocks.\n   - **Layer 3 (Top Layer)**:\n     - Between taller blocks is a yellow rectangular block and two orange triangular roof blocks on top of the blue cube and the right yellow block.\n\n### Block Selection from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n1. **Red Arch Blocks (3 needed)**:\n   - Block index: 1 (Red arch)\n   \n2. **Red Rectangular Blocks (2 needed)**:\n   - Block index: 4 (Red cube)\n\n3. **Green Block (1 needed)**:\n   - Block index: 5 (Green rectangle)\n\n4. **Yellow Half-Cylinder Block (1 needed)**:\n   - Block index: 11 (Yellow half-cylinder)\n\n5. **Yellow Tall Blocks (2 needed)**:\n   - Block index: 9 (Yellow tall block)\n\n6. **Blue Cube (1 needed)**:\n   - Block index: 2 (Blue cube)\n\n7. **Yellow Rectangle Block (1 needed)**:\n   - Block index: 8 (Yellow rectangle)\n\n8. **Orange Roof Blocks (2 needed)**:\n   - Block index: 14 (Orange triangular roof)\n\n### Assembly Instructions:\n\n```plaintext\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 4\n   Step7: Move block with index 11\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n   Step9: Move block with index 9\n   Step10: Move block with index 2\n   Step11: Move block with index 8\n   Step12: Move block with index 14\n   Step13: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nConstruct the structure by following each step, placing each block as instructed to match the target image.",

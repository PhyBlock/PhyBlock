There is one red rectangular block on top of the left arch.\n  - The top layer has a red triangular prism sitting on the red rectangular block, forming a roof.\n\n### Selection of Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Red Arch Block:** Use block index 1 or 2 (for bottom layer).\n- **Yellow Rectangular Block:** Use block index 4 for both middle platform blocks.\n- **Red Rectangular Block:** Use block index 11 (for middle layer block).\n- **Red Triangular Prism Block:** Use block index 14 (for the top layer).\n\n### Assembly Instructions:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n   Step6: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence should replicate the structure shown in the target image.",

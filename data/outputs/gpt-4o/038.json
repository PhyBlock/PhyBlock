They are oriented in a way that fits one on top of another to form the target structure.\n\n### Assembly Instructions:\n\n1. **Move block with index 5** to the base position.\n2. **Move block with index 6** directly on top of block 5.\n\nThis sequence will recreate the structure as shown in the main target image.",

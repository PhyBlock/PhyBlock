Red arch block (side view) - Index 1.\n2. Green vertical block - Index 9.\n3. Blue cube - Index 5.\n4. Yellow horizontal rectangular block - Index 11.\n5. Yellow vertical block - Index 12.\n6. Half-yellow cylinder - Index 15.\n7. Orange horizontal cylinder - Index 14.\n\n### Assembly Steps\n\n```plaintext\n{\n  Step 1: Move block with index 1 (place first arch).\n  Step 2: Move block with index 1 (place second arch).\n  Step 3: Move block with index 14 (place first horizontal cylinder).\n  Step 4: Move block with index 14 (place second horizontal cylinder).\n  Step 5: Move block with index 7 (place horizontal rectangle between arches and cylinders).\n  Step 6: Move block with index 5 (place cube on the horizontal rectangle).\n  Step 7: Move block with index 9 (place vertical green block).\n  Step 8: Move block with index 12 (place first vertical yellow block).\n  Step 9: Move block with index 12 (place second vertical yellow block).\n  Step 10: Move block with index 15 (place first half-yellow cylinder on arch).\n  Step 11: Move block with index 15 (place second half-yellow cylinder on arch).\n}\n```",

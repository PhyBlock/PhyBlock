Move block with index 5 (blue cube) for left bottom.\n2. Move block with index 8 (blue cube) for right bottom.\n3. Move block with index 13 (yellow rectangular prism) on top of blue blocks.\n4. Move block with index 6 (red cube) on right blue cube.\n5. Move block with index 9 (green rectangular prism) in the center.\n6. Move block with index 5 (blue cube) on the left.\n7. Move block with index 15 (orange triangular prism) to form left side of roof.\n8. Move block with index 16 (orange triangular prism) to form right side of roof.\n\n#### Bridge Structure\n1. Move block with index 1 (red arch block) for the left side of the bottom layer.\n2. Move block with index 1 (red arch block) for the right side of the bottom layer.\n3. Move block with index 13 (yellow rectangular prism) on top of the left arch.\n4. Move block with index 13 (yellow rectangular prism) on top of the right arch.\n5. Move block with index 2 (red rectangular prism) on left yellow block.\n6. Move block with index 2 (red rectangular prism) on right yellow block.\n\nThis is the step-by-step guide to building the structures correctly with the designated blocks.",

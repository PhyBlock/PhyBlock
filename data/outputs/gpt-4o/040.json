Here's the spatial arrangement:\n\n1. **Red Blocks**: There are two identical red blocks, one on each side, that have semi-circular cutouts. These surround the central blocks.\n2. **Central Blocks**: \n   - A blue cube is placed in the center.\n   - A green cube is directly attached to one side of the blue cube.\n\n### Selection from the Block Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks and their indices from the dictionary are:\n\n1. **Red Blocks (with semi-circular cutouts)**\n   - Needed: 2\n   - Indices: 6, 7 (two vertical orientations needed)\n\n2. **Blue Cube**\n   - Needed: 1\n   - Index: 9\n\n3. **Green Cube**\n   - Needed: 1\n   - Index: 10\n\n### Assembly Instructions\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence for the blocks:\n\n```plaintext\nStep 1: Move block with index 9 (Blue Cube) to the center.\nStep 2: Move block with index 10 (Green Cube) next to the blue cube.\nStep 3: Move block with index 6 (Red with cutout) to one side of the blue and green blocks.\nStep 4: Move block with index 7 (Red with cutout) to the opposite side.\n```\n\nThis sequence creates the desired structure as depicted in the main target image.",

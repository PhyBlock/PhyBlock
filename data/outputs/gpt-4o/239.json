The rectangular block is between them in the base layer.\n     - Cylindrical blocks are vertically placed side by side directly on the base.\n     - The top triangular block is centered on two cylindrical blocks, and a rectangular block is placed vertically to the side.\n   - **Structure 2 (right):**\n     - The base layer comprises a blue square block and a red quarter-circle cut-out block.\n     - Vertically placed rectangular blocks are on each side of the quarter-circle block.\n     - A wide rectangular green block lies horizontally on top.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Structure 1 (left):**\n  - Use block 14 and block 15 for the triangular sides.\n  - Use block 5 for the rectangular block in the base layer.\n  - Use block 7 for the two cylindrical blocks.\n  - Use block 16 for the top triangular block.\n  - Use block 6 for the side rectangular block.\n\n- **Structure 2 (right):**\n  - Use block 2 for the blue square.\n  - Use block 1 for the red quarter-circle cut-out.\n  - Use block 6 for the vertical rectangular green blocks.\n  - Use block 4 for the wide rectangular top block.\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 4\"\n}\n```",

Orange Cylinder - Index 11\n2. Blue Cube - Index 3\n3. Yellow Rectangular Block - Index 6\n4. Yellow Half-Cylinder - Index 13\n5. Red U-Shaped Block - Index 1\n6. Green Block - Index 5\n7. Orange Triangle Prism - Index 15\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n#### Construction #1 (Left):\n- **Step 1:** Move block with index 11 (First orange cylinder, left).\n- **Step 2:** Move block with index 11 (Second orange cylinder, right).\n- **Step 3:** Move block with index 6 (Yellow rectangular block) and place it across the cylinders.\n- **Step 4:** Move block with index 3 (Blue cube) and place it on the yellow block.\n- **Step 5:** Move block with index 13 (Yellow half-cylinder) and place it next to the blue cube.\n\n#### Construction #2 (Right):\n- **Step 6:** Move block with index 10 (Orange vertical cylinder).\n- **Step 7:** Move block with index 15 (Orange triangle prism) next to the vertical cylinder.\n- **Step 8:** Move block with index 5 (Green block) horizontally next to the prism.\n- **Step 9:** Move block with index 4 (Yellow cube) on top of the green block.\n- **Step 10:** Move block with index 3 (Blue cube) next to the yellow cube.\n- **Step 11:** Move block with index 1 (Red U-shaped block) on top of the blue and yellow cubes.\n- **Step 12:** Move block with index 13 (Yellow half-cylinder) on top of the red U-shaped block.\n- **Step 13:** Move block with index 13 (Another yellow half-cylinder) next to the first half-cylinder.\n\nThis step-by-step guide reconstructs the structures as seen in the target image.",

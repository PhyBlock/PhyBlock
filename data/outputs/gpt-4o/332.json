Red arch block facing forward (3 needed) - **Index 1**\n2. Long yellow block - **Index 8**\n3. Green cube - **Index 6**\n4. Blue cube - **Index 5**\n5. Orange triangular block - **Index 14**\n\n### Assembly Instructions:\n\n```\n{\n   Step 1: Move block with index 1 (place as the left base arch)\n   Step 2: Move block with index 1 (place as the right base arch)\n   Step 3: Move block with index 8 (horizontal on top of the arches)\n   Step 4: Move block with index 6 (place on the left, above the yellow block)\n   Step 5: Move block with index 5 (place on the right, above the yellow block)\n   Step 6: Move block with index 1 (place above the green and blue cube)\n   Step 7: Move block with index 14 (place on top of the red arch)\n}\n```\n\nFollow each step carefully to recreate the desired structure.",

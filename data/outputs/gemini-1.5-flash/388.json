Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two separate structures.  The left structure uses 3 blocks and has 3 layers. The right structure uses 5 blocks and has 5 layers.  In total, there are 8 blocks in the image.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:** A large orange triangle (base) is at the bottom, a green rectangular prism sits on top of its center, and a smaller orange triangle sits atop the green prism.\n\n    * **Right Structure:** A yellow block forms the base. On top of it is a blue block, then a red block with a hole, then a green rectangular prism, and finally an orange triangle at the very top.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need to identify the blocks from the dictionary that match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the target image.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Left Structure: 14, 5, 13\n    * Right Structure: 9, 3, 1, 7, 14\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** Each block index corresponds to a specific block in the dictionary, matching exactly in shape, color and rotation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nWe will assemble each structure separately.\n\n* **Left Structure Assembly:**\n\n   {\n     Step1: Move block with index 14\n     Step2: Move block with index 5\n     Step3: Move block with index 13\n   }\n\n* **Right Structure Assembly:**\n\n   {\n     Step4: Move block with index 9\n     Step5: Move block with index 3\n     Step6: Move block with index 1\n     Step7: Move block with index 7\n     Step8: Move block with index 14\n   }\n\n**Complete Assembly Instructions (Combining both structures):**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n}\n"

One section has three vertical layers, with a smaller additional element placed on top.  The second section is a two-layer structure.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two distinct sections.  The left section consists of three blocks: a yellow cylindrical base, a green rectangular block on top of the yellow cylinder, and an orange cylindrical block on top of the green block. The right section has a base of two connected red arch blocks, and above this base are three vertically stacked blocks; one green block, one yellow block, and another yellow block.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need to identify the blocks matching the target image. Using exact color, shape, and orientation.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Yellow Cylinder: 13\n    * Green Rectangular Block: 5\n    * Orange Cylinder: 10\n    * Red Arch Block: 2 (x2)\n    * Green Rectangular Block: 5\n    * Yellow Rectangular Block: 7\n    * Yellow Rectangular Block: 7\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n* **Inference of Order:**  A reasonable assembly order, building from the bottom up, is outlined below.\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 13\nStep2: Move block with index 5\nStep3: Move block with index 10\nStep4: Move block with index 2\nStep5: Move block with index 2\nStep6: Move block with index 5\nStep7: Move block with index 7\nStep8: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 7 blocks.  It has three main vertical layers.\n\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure consists of two distinct parts.\n\n    * **Part 1 (Tall Structure):** This is a vertical structure composed of:\n        * A yellow block (tall, vertical) as a central pillar.\n        * A green block on top of the yellow block.\n        * A smaller green block on top of the first green block.\n        * A red block placed against the yellow block, partially obscuring it.\n        * A blue block sitting on top of the red block.\n    * **Part 2 (Smaller Structure):** This is a small, two-block structure with:\n        * Two red curved blocks forming a sort of base or cradle.\n        * A blue cube resting atop the two red curved blocks.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Needed Blocks:**  We need to match the blocks based on their shape, color, and orientation.\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Yellow block (vertical): 14\n    * Green block (small, horizontal): 11\n    * Green block (small, horizontal): 11\n    * Red block (small, horizontal): 9\n    * Blue block (small, cube): 7\n    * Red curved block: 1\n    * Red curved block: 1\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**  The assembly order must consider stability.\n\n\n* **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The assembly order provided above prioritizes building the central tower first for stability, then adding the smaller structure.  There might be slight variations in a perfectly valid assembly sequence, but this should produce the desired result.\n"

            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the solution, following the specified steps:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two structures.  The taller structure uses 7 blocks and has 5 implied layers (though some blocks are partially hidden). The smaller structure uses 4 blocks and has 2 layers.  In total, there are 11 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Tall Structure):** The base is a green block (let's call it block A). On top of A is an orange cylindrical block (B).  Above B sits a triangular block (C). A green frame structure (D) surrounds block C. The frame's top and bottom parts are two green blocks and the vertical members are two green blocks.  The yellow block forms the top of the frame.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Small Structure):** The base consists of two horizontal orange cylinders (E). On top of the cylinders sits a yellow block (F). The blue cube (G) sits on top of the yellow block (F).\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** To build both structures we require the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n    * Block A: Index 5 (green block)\n    * Block B: Index 10 (orange cylinder)\n    * Block C: Index 12 (orange triangular prism)\n    * Block D: Indices 4 and 3 (green blocks) and 7 (yellow block)\n    * Block E: Index 10 (orange cylinder) x2\n    * Block F: Index 7 (yellow block)\n    * Block G: Index 1 (blue cube)\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 5, 10, 12, 4, 3, 7, 10, 10, 7, 1\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to start from the bottom of each structure and work upwards.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\nThis order represents a possible assembly sequence.  The two orange cylinders (index 10) could be placed simultaneously in step 7.  The order is mainly to represent the bottom-up construction principle for clarity. There might be other valid assembly sequences depending on physical constraints (e.g., whether one can place multiple blocks simultaneously).\n"

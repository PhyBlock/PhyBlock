Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks arranged in 4 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two yellow half-cylinder blocks are placed side-by-side, forming the base.\n    * **Layer 2:** A blue rectangular block sits on top of the yellow half-cylinders.\n    * **Layer 3:** A yellow rectangular block is centered on top of the blue block.\n    * **Layer 4:** A green block with a circular hole is placed atop the yellow block.  Above the green block is a red rectangular block, and finally a red triangular block at the very top.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need to identify the blocks matching the target image, respecting their orientation and color.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Block 11 (Yellow half-cylinder) x 2\n    * Block 3 (Blue cube)\n    * Block 6 (Yellow cube)\n    * Block 7 (Green block)\n    * Block 5 (Red cube)\n    * Block 16 (Red triangle)\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly to their shape, color, and orientation as shown in the block dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a possible assembly order.  There might be slight variations that also work, as long as they respect the layering and stability of the structure.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```\n"

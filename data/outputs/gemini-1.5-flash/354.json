Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses a total of 10 blocks.  It has three distinct vertical groupings that could be considered separate \"layers\" or sections. The tallest grouping is 4 blocks high, the medium grouping is 3, and the smaller grouping is 2.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The tallest structure (orange columns) is positioned on the left and consists of two vertical orange cylindrical blocks (index 11) stacked on top of each other and a single orange rectangular block (index 13) on top of them. An additional orange rectangular block is stacked on top of these.\n    * To the left of this central column, a yellow block (index 9) acts as a bridge, connecting the base of the central column with a second section.\n    * The second section is composed of a red arched block (index 2), with a blue cubic block (index 5) placed centrally on top.\n    * The third structure (on the right) consists of two red arched blocks (index 2) stacked vertically with a yellow rectangular block (index 10) positioned horizontally across both.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  The structure requires the following blocks from the dictionary:\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Two orange cylinders (index 11): 11, 11\n    * Two orange rectangular blocks (index 13): 13, 13\n    * One yellow rectangular block (index 9): 9\n    * One yellow rectangular block (index 10): 10\n    * One blue cube (index 5): 5\n    * Two red arched blocks (index 2): 2, 2\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order considers building up the tallest central column first to ensure stability for later additions. The step-by-step instruction below is just one of multiple possible correct sequences.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```\n"

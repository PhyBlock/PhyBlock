            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the solution, following the steps outlined in the task:\n\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses a total of 11 blocks.  It has a maximum of 3 layers in the rocket-like structure, while the other structure is 3 layers tall.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Rocket-like):**  A red block (arch) forms the base.  On top of it is a yellow block.  Then, the structure is topped with a red block (house-shaped).\n    * **Structure 2 (Tower):** Three orange cylinders are stacked vertically. A yellow block is placed horizontally across two of the orange cylinders.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** To reconstruct the target structure, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n* **Block Indices:**\n    * Index 1: Red arch-shaped block.\n    * Index 2: Red arch-shaped block.\n    * Index 6: Yellow rectangular block.\n    * Index 10: Red block.\n    * Index 7: Orange cylinder.\n    * Index 7: Orange cylinder.\n    * Index 7: Orange cylinder.\n    * Index 5: Yellow rectangular block.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The instruction to assemble the rocket structure comes first and needs more detailed instructions.  I've simplified the assembly instructions above to match the request in the format.  A more comprehensive instruction set might break down the placement of blocks within the rocket structure itself.  For example, it might state \"Place block 6 on top of block 1 and 2\" to be clearer about placement on the base.\n"

            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, analyzing the main image, selecting blocks, and providing assembly instructions:\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main image shows two structures built with blocks.\n\n* **Structure 1 (Giraffe-like):** This structure has four layers. The base consists of four identical orange cylindrical blocks (index 10).  Above that, a yellow rectangular block (index 9) forms the next layer.  The third layer consists of three orange triangular blocks (index 14) arranged in a staggered formation.  The top layer is a single yellow semi-circular block (index 11).  There are a total of 9 blocks in this structure.\n\n* **Structure 2 (House-like):** This structure has three layers.  The base layer has two orange blocks arranged vertically (index 13). Above this, a green rectangular block (index 6) is placed horizontally. The top layer consists of two blue square blocks (index 1) placed side-by-side. There are a total of 5 blocks in this structure.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above:\n\n* **Giraffe-like Structure:** Indices 10 (x4), 9, 14 (x3), 11\n* **House-like Structure:** Indices 13 (x2), 6, 1 (x2)\n\n**3. Determination of Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly instructions are given below, inferring a reasonable order for construction of the giraffe-like structure first, followed by the house-like structure.  Layering is assumed to occur from bottom to top. Note that there may be some flexibility in the order as long as blocks are placed in a stable manner:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON provides a clear step-by-step assembly sequence based on the block indices.  Remember that the actual physical placement of the blocks might require some adjustments for stability, but this sequence accurately reflects the block indices required for the final structures.\n"

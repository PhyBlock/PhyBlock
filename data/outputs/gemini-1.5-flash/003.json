There are two layers: a bottom layer of 5 blocks and a top layer of 2 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The bottom layer comprises 5 identical orange cylindrical blocks arranged in a row with small gaps between them.  The top layer consists of two identical green rectangular blocks placed horizontally, side-by-side, directly on top of the middle two orange cylinders of the bottom layer.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n    * Five orange cylindrical blocks (identical)\n    * Two green rectangular blocks (identical)\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Five instances of block index 7.\n    * Two instances of block index 1.\n\n* **Matching Criteria:**  The chosen indices match the orientation and shape of the blocks in the target image exactly.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should be from bottom to top, to ensure stability. The steps are as follows:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\nThis structure assumes that the placement of block 7 (the orange cylinders) is flexible enough that they don't need specific placement order in step 1-5 (which is likely the case).  If they needed to be placed in exact positions, a more detailed description would be required for a precise assembly order.\n"

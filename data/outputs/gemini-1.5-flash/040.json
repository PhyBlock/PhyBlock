Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses four blocks in total.  It has two visible layers; however, the red block functionally acts as three layers because it encompasses the inner blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** A red block forms the outer frame.  A smaller blue block sits inside the red frame, slightly offset to the left and slightly below center. A green block rests adjacent to the right side of the blue block. The green block is also partially embedded within the red block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n    * Red Block:  Block index 6 (vertical red block with a through-hole)\n    * Blue Block: Block index 9 (blue cube)\n    * Green Block: Block index 10 (green cube)\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 6, 9, 10\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to consider that the red block acts as a frame. The blue and green blocks must be placed within the frame and in the order that is described:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```"

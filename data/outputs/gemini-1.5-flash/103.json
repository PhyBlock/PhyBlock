Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of three blocks in total. It has two layers: a bottom layer with two identical cylindrical blocks, and a top layer with one rectangular block.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** Two identical orange cylindrical blocks (index 7 or 9 - assuming orientation doesn't matter for this step) form the bottom layer, positioned side-by-side. The yellow rectangular block (index 1 or 2) rests on top of, and centered between, the two cylinders.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need two orange cylindrical blocks and one yellow rectangular block.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**  Two blocks with index 7 or 9 (cylinders) and one block with index 1 or 2 (yellow rectangle).  Note that using index 7 twice or index 9 twice for the cylinders is perfectly acceptable.  The orientation of the rectangle needs to be horizontal (either index 1 or 2).\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly as shown without rotation.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is determined by the layering of the blocks.  The base must be placed first.\n\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index {7}\n   Step2: Move block with index {7}\n   Step3: Move block with index {1} \n}\n\n(Or using index 9 instead of 7)\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index {9}\n   Step2: Move block with index {9}\n   Step3: Move block with index {1} \n}\n\n\n(Or using index 2 instead of 1)\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index {7}\n   Step2: Move block with index {7}\n   Step3: Move block with index {2} \n}\n\n(Or using index 9 instead of 7)\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index {9}\n   Step2: Move block with index {9}\n   Step3: Move block with index {2} \n}\n\nThe choice between indices 1 and 2, and 7 and 9, is acceptable as they are visually identical but different indices in the dictionary.  The final structure will be the same.\n"

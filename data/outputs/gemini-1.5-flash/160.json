            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, analyzing the main target image, selecting blocks, and providing assembly instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 10 blocks.  The left structure has 6 blocks across multiple layers and the right structure has 4 blocks across multiple layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:** This structure is a house-like shape. The bottom layer has two triangular blocks (one red, one orange) forming the base of the structure.  On top of these are a circular block with a hole, then a green square block, and finally a blue square block forming the 'roof'. The arrangement is a pyramid shape.\n\n    * **Right Structure:**  This structure is a stylized building with two pillars.  The bottom layer consists of a yellow block.  Above this, two orange cylindrical blocks (pillars) are placed, and a yellow triangle-shaped block tops the pillars to complete the structure.\n\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n\n    * Left Structure:\n        * Orange Triangle: Index 14\n        * Red Triangle: Index 15\n        * Circular Block: Index 1\n        * Green Square: Index 6\n        * Blue Square: Index 5\n        * Orange Block: Index 13\n    * Right Structure:\n        * Yellow Block: Index 7\n        * Orange Cylinder: Index 10 (x2)\n        * Yellow Triangle: Index 16\n\n\n**3. Determination of Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to be layered.  Blocks must be placed such that the weight of the blocks above don't cause them to topple over.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order prioritizes building the base layers first in each structure before adding the top layers.  It provides a reasonably stable sequence. Remember, this assumes the blocks are placed carefully to avoid toppling.\n"

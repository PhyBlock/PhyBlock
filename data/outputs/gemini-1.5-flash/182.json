It has a maximum of 3 layers in some parts.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure can be conceptually broken into two parts:\n    * **Part 1 (Cart):**  Two orange cylindrical blocks form a base. A yellow rectangular block sits on top.  A blue cube and a red cube are placed on top of the yellow block.\n    * **Part 2 (Structure):** Two orange cylindrical blocks form vertical supports. A yellow rectangular block sits on top of these, bridging the gap between them. A red arched block sits atop the yellow block. Finally, an orange triangular block is placed on top of the arch.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Based on the visual analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n* **Block Indices:**\n    * Orange Cylinder: 10 (x2)\n    * Yellow Rectangular Block: 9 (x2)\n    * Blue Cube: 4\n    * Red Cube: 6\n    * Red Arched Block: 1\n    * Orange Triangular Block: 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize stability. We build the cart first, then the main structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The order of steps 4 and 5 (blue and red cube) is interchangeable as they are placed on top of the yellow block, similarly, steps 7 and 8 (yellow and arched block) can also be reversed without affecting the final structure.\n"

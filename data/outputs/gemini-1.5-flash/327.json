            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  The first structure is composed of 5 blocks in 3 layers.  The second structure consists of 4 blocks in 3 layers.  In total, the image contains 9 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure 1):**\n    * A triangular block (likely index 12) forms the top layer.\n    * Below it, two vertical green blocks (likely index 2) sit side by side.\n    * The bottom layer is formed by a horizontal orange block (likely index 14 or 15), and a smaller orange block (likely index 10 or 11) is partially overlaid by the green blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure 2):**\n    * A green cube (likely index 1 or 4) forms the base.\n    * An orange cylinder (likely index 6 or 7) is placed on top.\n    * Two vertical green blocks (likely index 2) are placed on top of the cylinder, forming a 'U' shape.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Blocks:**\n    * Structure 1: Index 12, Index 2 (x2), Index 14, Index 10.\n    * Structure 2: Index 1, Index 6, Index 2 (x2)\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 12, 2, 2, 14, 10, 1, 6, 2, 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nTo ensure the structure is stable, we'll build from the bottom up. However, we will work on the separate structures separately.\n\n**Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1\": {\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n  },\n  \"Structure 2\": {\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON format separates the instructions for building each structure, making the assembly process clearer.  Remember that these instructions assume that the blocks have already been identified and are ready to be used.  The index numbers directly correspond to those in the image provided.\n"

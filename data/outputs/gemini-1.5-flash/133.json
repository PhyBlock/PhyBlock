            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 7 blocks in total.  It has two distinct layers. The bottom layer has two blocks, and the top layer has five blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The bottom layer consists of two identical red arch-shaped blocks placed side-by-side.  The top layer has three vertically stacked blocks in the center.  These are, from bottom to top: a green block, followed by a yellow block, then a second yellow block directly above it. To the right and left of this central stack are single yellow blocks (the right one is directly above the right-side red arch).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n    * Two red arch-shaped blocks (same orientation)\n    * One green rectangular block (horizontal)\n    * Two yellow rectangular blocks (vertical)\n    * Two yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal)\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Red arch-shaped blocks: 1, 1 (or any two blocks with this orientation; 2, 2 or 3, 3 etc.)\n    * Green rectangular block: 9 (or 11)\n    * Yellow rectangular blocks (vertical): 14, 14 (or any two blocks with this orientation, 15, 15)\n    * Yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal): 13, 13 (or any two blocks with this orientation)\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly needs to be done in a way that no block is left unsupported. The bottom layer must be constructed first.  The central stack in the upper layer needs to be built from the bottom up.\n\n* **Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  There are multiple valid solutions depending on which matching block indexes you chose from the dictionary.  The provided answer is just one valid example that ensures stability during construction.  The key is to place the bottom layer first then proceed to the top layer with appropriate stacking.\n"

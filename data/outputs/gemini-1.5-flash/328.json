            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, analyzing the target image, selecting blocks, and providing assembly instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures built with blocks. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 6 blocks and has 3 layers.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  It's a triangular structure. The base is formed by block 1 (red arch) and block 4 (green block).  Above the arch sits block 5 (blue block), and atop that is block 6 (blue block).  On the right-hand side, the triangular shape is completed by blocks 11 (orange triangle) and 14 (orange triangle).\n\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**  This structure uses 5 blocks and has 3 layers.\n* **Spatial Relationships:** It has a central vertical orange pillar (block 10) with a single orange triangle (block 12) forming its peak. The base has four orange triangles (block 16) around the central pillar and a small blue block (block 6) at the base.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** 1, 4, 5, 6, 11, 14\n* **Block Indices:** 1, 4, 5, 6, 11, 14\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** 6, 10, 12, 16 (x4)\n* **Block Indices:** 6, 10, 12, 16, 16, 16, 16\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nI will provide assembly instructions for each structure separately.\n\n**Structure 1 Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Structure 2 Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```\n\nRemember that this assumes a bottom-up approach to building.  The exact step-by-step might need minor adjustments depending on the physical limitations of handling the blocks.  Also note the use of multiple block 16 instances.\n"

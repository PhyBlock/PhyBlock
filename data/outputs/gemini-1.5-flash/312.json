            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, following the specified steps:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 11 blocks.  The left structure has 5 layers and the right structure has 5 layers.  There are multiple blocks which are not completely visible on one axis.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:**  A red arched block (base) supports a green block. On top of that green block is another green block. On top of that green block is a blue block.  Atop the blue block sits an orange triangular block.\n\n    * **Right Structure:** A red block forms the base.  Next to it, to the left, is a yellow block. On top of the red block is a blue block.  Next to the blue block (right) is a green block. The green block is not fully visible.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the visual analysis of the Main Target Image and the Block Dictionary Image, the following blocks are needed:\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    1.  Index 1 (Red arched block)\n    2.  Index 5 (Green Cube)\n    3.  Index 5 (Green Cube)\n    4.  Index 8 (Blue Cube)\n    5.  Index 15 (Orange Triangular Block)\n    6. Index 6 (Red Cube)\n    7. Index 13 (Yellow Block)\n    8. Index 6 (Red Cube)\n    9. Index 8 (Blue Cube)\n    10. Index 5 (Green Cube)\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nIt's important to note that there are multiple possible assembly orders that would work. Here is one that prioritizes stability:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n\n}\n```\n\nThis order ensures that each block is placed on a stable base before adding the next.  Other sequences could also be valid as long as stability is maintained at each step.  There is some ambiguity regarding the placement of block 5 (green cube) in the right structure. Due to incomplete visual information, one cannot definitively determine whether it is placed before or after the yellow block. Therefore, its exact placement in the assembly instructions may vary slightly depending on the interpretation.\n"

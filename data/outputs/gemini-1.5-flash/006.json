Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of five blocks in three layers.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  The base layer is formed by two identical orange triangular blocks (isosceles, angled similarly) placed symmetrically at the bottom. The second layer is formed by two identical green rectangular blocks placed vertically, one on each side of a central vertical orange cylindrical block which extends to the top.  The top layer consists of a single orange triangular block (isosceles, pointing upwards), sitting atop the cylindrical block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n    * Two orange triangular blocks (isosceles, angled similarly) matching the blocks in the base.\n    * Two green rectangular blocks (vertical orientation).\n    * One orange cylindrical block (vertical orientation).\n    * One orange triangular block (isosceles, pointing upwards).\n* **List Block Indices:** 14, 14, 3, 3, 6, 12\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are selected precisely matching their shape, color, and orientation as presented in the dictionary image.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the visual analysis and the need for a stable structure, a reasonable assembly order would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```\n\nThis order places the base first, then the central cylinder, followed by the side green blocks, and finally the top triangle.  Alternative orders might be possible,  but this is a logical approach considering structural stability.\n"

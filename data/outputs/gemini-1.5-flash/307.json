            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two separate structures.  The first structure has 5 blocks and 3 layers. The second structure has 4 blocks and is essentially a single layer, though one block is nested within another.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure 1):**\n    *  A red arch-shaped block (base) supports two vertical green blocks.\n    *  A yellow block sits atop the green blocks.\n    *  An orange triangular block sits atop the yellow block.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure 2):**\n    * A red block forms the outer ring.\n    * A green block is nested within the red ring.\n    * A blue block is nested inside the green block.\n    * Another red block is placed such that it overlaps the green block within the red ring.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Structure 1):**\n    * Red Arch: Index 2\n    * Green Block (vertical): Index 7\n    * Yellow Block (horizontal): Index 10\n    * Orange Triangle: Index 14\n    * Red block (Base): Index 12 (Two red blocks are used as the base. Using index 12 twice makes the most sense as index 1 will not fit properly)\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Structure 2):**\n    * Red Ring: Index 4\n    * Green Block (horizontal): Index 6\n    * Blue Block: Index 5\n    * Red Block (horizontal): Index 10 (A horizontal block is used as a overlay for the green block.)\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [2, 7, 10, 14, 12, 4, 6, 5, 10]\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nIt's important to note that building instructions could vary slightly depending on structural stability and personal preference. This sequence prioritizes placing blocks and creating structural stability.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order focuses first on building the larger structure (steps 1-7) and then the smaller one (steps 8-11).  Within each structure, it attempts to build from the base upward for stability.  Remember, slight variations in assembly order might be possible while maintaining the structural integrity of the final build.\n"

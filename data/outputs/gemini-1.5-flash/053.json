Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 6 blocks in total, arranged across 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is essentially an \"I\" shape.  Two yellow blocks form the vertical sides of the \"I\". Two vertical pairs of blocks (green/orange and blue/red) are situated between the yellow sides. The orange and red blocks are on the bottom, with the green and blue on top.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need the following blocks:\n\n    * Two yellow horizontal blocks (to create the outer shape of the “I”)\n    * One green block\n    * One orange block\n    * One blue block\n    * One red block\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Yellow Horizontal Block (x2): Index 6 and Index 10.\n    * Green Block: Index 2\n    * Orange Block: Index 3\n    * Blue Block: Index 1\n    * Red Block: Index 4\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to ensure the structural integrity. Building from the bottom up is typically best.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\nThis order places the two yellow blocks first to create the basic \"I\" structure. Then the orange and red blocks are placed, followed by green and blue blocks on top to complete the \"I\".  Any other logical bottom-up approach would also be valid as long as blocks are correctly placed in relation to one another.\n"

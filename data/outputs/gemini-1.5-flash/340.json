It has three main layers, plus a separate smaller structure. The main structure has a base of four columns, then a platform, and finally a three-block tower.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * Four orange cylindrical blocks (index 5 or 12, to be determined by matching) form the base, arranged in a square.\n    * A yellow rectangular block (index 3 or 4, to be determined by matching) sits atop the orange blocks.\n    * A green cube (index 2), a blue cube (index 1), and a yellow quarter-cylinder (index 6) are stacked vertically on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n    * A separate smaller structure consists of a blue cube (index 1) and an orange triangular prism (index 13 or 14, to be determined by matching).\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on the visual comparison:\n\n    * **Base:** Four instances of block index 5 (orange cylinder)\n    * **Platform:** Block index 3 (yellow rectangular block, horizontal)\n    * **Tower:** Block index 2 (green cube), index 1 (blue cube), index 6 (yellow quarter-cylinder)\n    * **Small Structure:** Block index 1 (blue cube), index 13 (orange triangular prism)\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 6, 1, 13\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly in shape, color, and orientation as shown in the dictionary.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize building the base first, then build upwards.  There is some flexibility, but this order keeps the structure stable.\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 6\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n}\n\n"

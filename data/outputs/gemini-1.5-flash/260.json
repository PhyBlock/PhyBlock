Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 8 blocks.  There are two distinct sub-structures. The taller one has four layers, and the shorter one has three layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Taller):** A red block (base) supports a green block, which in turn supports a red triangular block.  On top of this sits an orange cylinder.\n    * **Structure 2 (Shorter):** A red arch-shaped block forms the base.  A green block sits on top of this, followed by another red arch-shaped block on top.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  To construct the target structure, we need the following blocks:\n\n    * Red arch-shaped block (x2)\n    * Green rectangular block (x2)\n    * Red rectangular block\n    * Orange cylinder\n    * Red triangular block\n\n* **List Block Indices:** The corresponding block indices are: 1, 2, 5, 6, 13, 9, 16\n\n* **Matching Criteria:**  All blocks are selected based on exact shape, color, and orientation as presented in the dictionary.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe following assembly order is inferred, building from the bottom up for each structure,  and then combining those structures:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```\n"

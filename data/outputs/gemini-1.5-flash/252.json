The other structure has 3 layers in the tallest area.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The image shows two distinct structures.\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Tower):** A tall orange cylindrical block (11) forms the base and core of the tower.  On top of it sits a yellow block (7), followed by another orange block (11)  and then a smaller orange roof piece (12). On the  two orange pillars, (11) two red roof pieces (16) are placed.\n\n    * **Structure 2:** This structure is composed of several blocks arranged next to each other and in layers.  A blue block (3) is at the bottom left. Above it, and to the right, is a green block (5). Above this green block is a yellow block (6) and a short orange block (15). To the right, is another yellow block(8) and a medium orange block(4).  Below those two blocks are two arched red blocks (1).\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Based on the visual analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n    * Two orange cylindrical blocks (index 11)\n    * One small orange roof block (index 12)\n    * Two red roof blocks (index 16)\n    * One yellow block (index 7)\n    * One small green block (index 5)\n    * One small yellow block (index 6)\n    * One short orange block (index 15)\n    * One yellow block (index 8)\n    * One orange block (index 4)\n    * One blue block (index 3)\n    * Two red arched blocks (index 1)\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 11, 11, 12, 16, 16, 7, 5, 6, 15, 8, 4, 3, 1, 1\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly instructions are written to build the structures from the bottom up. There may be other valid assembly sequences.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 4\"\n}\n```\n"

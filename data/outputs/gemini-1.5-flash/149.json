Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 9 blocks in total. It has three main vertical sections and a horizontal layer. The structure has multiple implicitly defined layers, based on the stacking order.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * Three vertical columns of orange cylindrical blocks (block type 6, 7, or 8) form the base structure. The tallest central column is three blocks high. Two shorter flanking columns are two blocks high.\n    * A horizontal yellow block (block type 1, 2, 3, or 4) connects the two shorter columns.\n    * Two orange triangular blocks (block type 13, 14, 15, or 16) sit atop the yellow block, creating an upper horizontal structure.\n    * Three additional orange cylindrical blocks (block type 6, 7, or 8) sit on top of the two shorter columns and the center column to create triangular roof shapes atop the shorter columns.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  To precisely match the target structure, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Three instances of block index 6 (vertical orange cylindrical block)\n    * Two instances of block index 7 (horizontal orange cylindrical block)\n    * One instance of block index 1 (horizontal yellow block)\n    * Two instances of block index 14 (orange triangular roof block)\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly based on shape, color and orientation as shown in the block dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly needs to happen in a way that ensures stability.  Here's a suggested assembly order:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 8\"\n\n}\n```\n\nThis order ensures that the base columns are built first, followed by the connecting horizontal piece and then the roof and  upper portion of the structure.  Alternative orders are possible as long as they result in a stable structure that matches the image, but placing the roof pieces before the supports would not work.\n"

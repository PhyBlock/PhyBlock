Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  The first structure (house-like) has 4 blocks and 2 layers. The second structure has 5 blocks and 3 layers.  In total, there are 9 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure 1 - House):**\n    * A yellow block forms the base.\n    * A blue block is placed on top of the yellow block.\n    * An orange block with an arch forms the central part of the house structure. This sits on the blue block.\n    * A smaller orange triangular piece sits atop the central orange piece, forming the roof.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure 2):**\n    * A green block forms the base.\n    * A yellow block sits on top of the green block.\n    * A blue block is placed on top of the yellow block.\n    * A red block is placed on the right of the yellow/blue stack.\n    * A red curved block sits on top of the red block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n    * Structure 1:  10 (Yellow), 7 (Blue), 5 (Orange arch), 15 (Orange Triangle)\n    * Structure 2: 8 (Green), 6 (Yellow), 4 (Blue), 1 (Red block), 2 (Red curved block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is given below, following the layer structure from bottom to top, and separating the assembly instructions for each structure:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1\": {\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n  },\n  \"Structure 2\": {\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON format allows for a clear separation of instructions for each of the two structures.  A flattened version can be easily generated by combining the steps if required.\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses four blocks and has three layers.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  The structure consists of a central red block (with a hole) flanked by yellow blocks at the top and bottom.  The yellow blocks are positioned horizontally. The red block is vertically oriented and sits between the two yellow blocks.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n    *  A horizontally oriented yellow block (for top and bottom).\n    * A vertically oriented red block with a central hole.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Top Yellow Block: Index 9\n    * Bottom Yellow Block: Index 9\n    * Red Block: Index 7\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly in terms of shape, color, and orientation as they appear in the block dictionary.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n}\n\nThe first yellow block (index 9) is placed as the base. Then the red block (index 7) is placed on top. Finally, the second yellow block (index 9) is placed on top of the red block.\n"

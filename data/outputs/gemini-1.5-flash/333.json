The left structure has 3 blocks and 3 layers. The right structure has 5 blocks and 5 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:** A red arched block (the \"arch\" is on top) forms the base.  A green block sits atop the bottom-most portion of the arch. A blue cube sits on top of that green block, completely within the arch.\n\n    * **Right Structure:** A red arched block (arch on top) forms the base. A blue block sits on the lower portion of the arch. A yellow block is placed atop the blue block. A green block sits on top of the yellow block. Another red arched block (arch on top) sits on top of the green block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:**\n        * Red arched block (arch on top): Index 1\n        * Green block: Index 14\n        * Blue cube: Index 7\n\n    * **Right Structure:**\n        * Red arched block (arch on top): Index 1 (x2)\n        * Blue block: Index 7\n        * Yellow block: Index 11\n        * Green block: Index 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to be considered for each structure separately due to the interlocking pieces.  There's some ambiguity in what constitutes a “step,” as the blocks need to be placed so they can support other blocks above.\n\n\n* **Left Structure Assembly:**\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 14\n  Step3: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\n* **Right Structure Assembly:**\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 7\n  Step3: Move block with index 11\n  Step4: Move block with index 14\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** This assembly order prioritizes placing the blocks from bottom to top.  Any deviation in the order would cause instability.  In a real-world scenario, the order might need slight adjustments depending on the precision with which the blocks fit together and the risk of accidental knocking over during construction.\n"

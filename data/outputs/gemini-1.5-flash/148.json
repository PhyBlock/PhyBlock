Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses a total of 7 blocks. It has three distinct layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Base Layer:** Two identical orange cylindrical blocks are positioned side-by-side.\n    * **Middle Layer:** A yellow rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the two base cylinders. Another identical yellow block sits horizontally on top of the first, slightly offset to the right, creating an \"L\" shape.\n    * **Top Layer:** A tall orange cylinder sits on top of the two base cylinders, extending vertically and acting as the central support structure. This is topped with an orange triangular block, forming a pointed peak.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need blocks to match the shapes, colors, and orientations present in the target structure.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Base Cylinders (2): Index 6 (repeated)\n    * Yellow Horizontal Blocks (2): Index 1 (repeated)\n    * Tall Orange Cylinder: Index 6\n    * Top Orange Triangle: Index 10\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are selected to precisely match shape, color, and orientation in the dictionary.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to be from the bottom up due to the stack-like structure.  It's crucial to lay the base first to avoid instability.\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 10\n}"

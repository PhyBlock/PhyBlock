The leftmost column has 4 levels, the central column has 2, and the rightmost column has 3. \n\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The leftmost column consists of block 13 (tall orange cylinder) at the base, topped by two blocks of 10 (yellow horizontal block) then  block 1 (arch) above it, and finally a small blue cube (block 4) on top of the arch.\n    * The central column has two vertical blocks that extend upwards only.\n    * The rightmost column consists of block 9 (yellow horizontal block) at the base, then block 5 (red block) followed by a green block (block 6) and the small blue cube at the top.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on the analysis above:\n    * Block 13 (tall orange cylinder)\n    * Block 10 (yellow horizontal block) x2\n    * Block 1 (arch)\n    * Block 4 (small blue cube) x2\n    * Block 9 (yellow horizontal block)\n    * Block 5 (red block)\n    * Block 6 (green block)\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 13, 10, 10, 1, 4, 9, 5, 6, 4\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 13\nStep2: Move block with index 10\nStep3: Move block with index 10\nStep4: Move block with index 1\nStep5: Move block with index 4\nStep6: Move block with index 9\nStep7: Move block with index 5\nStep8: Move block with index 6\nStep9: Move block with index 4\n\n}\n```\n\n"

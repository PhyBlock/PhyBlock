Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image contains three blocks in total.  It has two layers. The bottom layer has two blocks, and the top layer has one block.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** Two identical red, half-cylinder shaped blocks are placed side-by-side in the bottom layer. A blue cube rests on top of, and centered between, the two red blocks.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n    * Two red, half-cylinder blocks in a specific orientation.\n    * One blue cube.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Block Index 1 (or 2, they are mirrored, but given step 3, using either is functionally equivalent) - Red half-cylinder\n    * Block Index 1 (or 2) - Red half-cylinder\n    * Block Index 9 - Blue cube\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** The selected blocks exactly match the shape, color, and orientation in the target image.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize placing the base first, to provide a stable foundation before placing the top block. The left and right red blocks are mirror images. Therefore, either can go on either side without changing functionality.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  While indices 1 and 2 are functionally identical in this specific task and either can be used for Step 1 and Step 2, the provided solution uses index \"1\" twice for consistency.  Replacing either or both \"1\" with \"2\" will also result in a correct assembly.\n"

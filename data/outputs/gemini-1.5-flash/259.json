Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  Let's call them Structure A (the taller one) and Structure B (the shorter one).\n\n    * **Structure A:** This structure uses 5 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    * **Structure B:** This structure uses 4 blocks and has 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure A:** A yellow block (base) supports two vertically stacked orange cylindrical blocks.  On top of the cylindrical blocks, a yellow block sits horizontally, supporting a final orange block which is similar to block number 13 in the dictionary but flipped.\n    * **Structure B:** A yellow block (base) supports a red block with a circular hole. Atop this, another yellow block is placed horizontally, acting as a bridge between two small arches on the lower red block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure A:**\n    * Base: Index 5\n    * Cylinders: Index 10 (x2)\n    * Horizontal Yellow: Index 5\n    * Top Orange: Index 13\n\n* **Structure B:**\n    * Base: Index 5\n    * Red Block with Hole: Index 2\n    * Horizontal Yellow: Index 6\n    *\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to be bottom-up for stability.\n\n\n**Structure A Assembly:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\n**Structure B Assembly:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n}\n```\n\n**Complete Assembly Instructions (combining both structures):**  It's impossible to give a single ordered sequence for both structures without specifying which should be built first, and how they are arranged relative to one another in the final setup. The instructions above build them independently.  To combine, choose the desired spatial arrangement (which is not clearly indicated in the provided Main Target Image) and add steps accordingly. For example, you might have a step that says \"Place Structure A to the left of Structure B\".  However, you cannot combine step indices between Structures A and B.  You must keep them as two distinct build sequences.\n"

            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, following the specified steps:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 10 blocks.  It has three main layers or levels in the larger structure, plus a separate two-block structure.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The larger structure is built like a rocket.  The bottom layer consists of a yellow block (horizontal), and a red block (vertical) with a circular hole. On top of this are a green, blue, and red square block, forming the body.  The top layer is a triangular orange block. The second smaller structure consists of two yellow blocks horizontally and a smaller orange triangular block on top.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Yellow horizontal rectangular block: 7\n    * Red block with a circular hole: 1\n    * Green square block: 5\n    * Blue square block: 4\n    * Red square block: 3 (note this is a different orientation than the central red block)\n    * Orange triangular block: 14\n    * Yellow block (horizontal): 9\n    * Yellow block (half-cylinder, forming the base): 9 (x2)\n    * Small Orange Triangular block: 14 (x2)\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order must consider the layering and stability of the structure. It is crucial to place the base blocks first to have a foundation for upper layers.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  The image doesn't provide a perfect match for the red block in the middle. The available index 3 would need a very minor rotation to be an exact match, but this is forbidden per the instructions.  I have chosen index 3 with the understanding that the minor rotation discrepancy is tolerated because a perfect match does not exist in the block dictionary provided.  The same applies to the orange triangular block.  Index 14 is used even though the smaller triangle structure requires two.  The provided dictionary does not contain a smaller variant.\n"

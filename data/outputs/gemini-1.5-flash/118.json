It has three distinct levels, although some blocks are partially layered.  The central vertical column (orange) spans multiple layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The base consists of two vertical orange cylindrical blocks (block 11 appears twice).\n    * A yellow block (block 7) sits atop and between the two base cylinders.\n    * A blue cube (block 5) rests on the yellow block.\n    * A red arch-shaped block (block 2) sits atop the yellow block, partially overlapping the blue cube.\n    * The central vertical orange cylinder extends upwards from the bottom cylinders.\n    * A triangle-shaped orange block (block 16) is stacked on top of the central vertical cylinder to form a peak.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n    * Two orange cylinders (index 11).\n    * One yellow block (index 7).\n    * One blue cube (index 5).\n    * One red arch-shaped block (index 2).\n    * One orange triangular block (index 16)\n    * One longer orange cylinder (index 11)\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [11, 11, 7, 5, 2, 16, 11] (index 11 is used three times)\n\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks listed are directly matched from the dictionary image without any rotation.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe order of construction should prioritize the stability of the structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order places the base first, then adds the blocks upward, ensuring the structure's stability.  Note that it is impossible to add the top triangle (block 16) until the other blocks are placed.\n"

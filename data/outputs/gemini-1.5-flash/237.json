The left structure has 5 blocks in 2 layers, while the right structure has 7 blocks in 4 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:** A triangular block (base down) forms the bottom-left. Next to it, are two vertical rectangular blocks. Atop these is a smaller vertical rectangular block and itâ€™s topped with a triangular block (base up).\n    * **Right Structure:** A 2x2 base is formed with blocks 5 and 1 (bottom-left), 1 and 6 (bottom-right), then a green block is placed on top of blocks 1 & 5. On top of this is another orange block, completed by a red block on the very top.\n\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**  To reconstruct the target image, we need the following blocks (indices):\n\n    * Index 1: Blue cube\n    * Index 5: Yellow cube\n    * Index 6: Green rectangular block (horizontal)\n    * Index 7: Green rectangular block (vertical)\n    * Index 8: Green rectangular block (vertical)\n    * Index 10: Orange cylindrical block\n    * Index 11: Orange triangular block (base down)\n    * Index 12: Orange triangular block (base up)\n    * Index 3: Orange cube\n    * Index 4: Red cube\n    * Index 14: Orange triangular block (base right)\n\n* **Block Indices List:** 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 3, 4, 14\n\n\n**3. Determination of Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 11\nStep2: Move block with index 10\nStep3: Move block with index 7\nStep4: Move block with index 8\nStep5: Move block with index 12\nStep6: Move block with index 1\nStep7: Move block with index 5\nStep8: Move block with index 6\nStep9: Move block with index 3\nStep10: Move block with index 4\nStep11: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** This assembly order prioritizes building the left structure first. This is just one possible order and any order that results in the correct final structure is correct.  For example, the right structure could be built first and then the left. However, the above considers building base layers and then moving up in height."

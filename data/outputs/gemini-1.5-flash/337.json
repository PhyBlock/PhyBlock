            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, following the specified steps:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  Let's call them Structure A (left) and Structure B (right).\n\n    * **Structure A:** Contains 7 blocks across multiple layers. The base appears to be one block, and from there, layers are added on top.\n\n    * **Structure B:** Contains 5 blocks, organized in a rectangular structure across multiple layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure A:**  The base block is a curved piece.  Above it are various rectangular and triangular blocks stacked.  The spatial relationship is somewhat complex and non-linear, with blocks positioned in a less regular manner.\n\n    * **Structure B:** This structure is simpler, with blocks neatly stacked on top of each other and next to each other in a vertical layout.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure A:**\n    * Block Index 1:  Base, curved piece.\n    * Block Index 5: Small blue cube.\n    * Block Index 5: Another small blue cube.\n    * Block Index 5: A third small blue cube.\n    * Block Index 6: Small green cube.\n    * Block Index 14: Small orange house-shaped block.\n    * Block Index 9: Small green rectangular block.\n\n* **Structure B:**\n    * Block Index 13: Yellow rectangular block for the base.\n    * Block Index 6: Green cube.\n    * Block Index 7: Orange cube.\n    * Block Index 5: Blue cube.\n    * Block Index 2: Red curved block.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nIt's crucial to build from the bottom up and consider supporting structures.  Here's a suggested assembly order:\n\n**Structure A:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Structure B:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  This assembly order is a suggestion.  Other orders might also be valid, provided the stability of the structure is maintained at each step.  The critical aspect is that blocks are not rotated and are placed exactly as they appear in the dictionary image.\n"

            "text": "Here's a step-by-step analysis and solution to the building block construction problem:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image shows two separate structures.  The first structure uses 5 blocks and has 3 layers. The second structure uses 4 blocks and has 2 layers.  In total, there are 9 blocks used across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Left):** A blue cube (1) is in the center at the second layer. Three orange triangular prisms (11) are arranged around the cube forming the base layer, pointing outwards.  An orange triangular prism (11) points upwards from the cube, forming the top layer.\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Right):** Two orange cylinders (7) form vertical supports. A yellow cuboid (3) is placed horizontally across the top of these two cylinders.  An orange triangular prism (10) rests on top of the yellow cuboid, forming the roof-like structure.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, we need:\n\n    * 1 blue cube (index 1)\n    * 4 orange triangular prisms (indices 11 and 10)\n    * 2 orange cylinders (index 7)\n    * 1 yellow cuboid (index 3)\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 11, 11, 11, 10, 7, 7, 3\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is designed to build the structures from the ground up, being mindful that the blocks cannot be rotated.  The step numbers don't strictly represent chronological build time (for example, blocks for structure 2 can be laid down at the same time as blocks for structure 1 are being placed), they are instead just a numbered list to indicate which block to place.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence first places the base of Structure 1 (three orange triangular prisms index 11). Then places the blue cube (index 1) on top. The top triangle for structure 1 (index 10) is added next.  After that, the base of structure 2 (two orange cylinders, index 7) is built. Finally, the horizontal block and roof (index 3 and index 10) are added.  Note that this does not imply you cannot build Structure 1 and 2 concurrently if it is more convenient.\n"

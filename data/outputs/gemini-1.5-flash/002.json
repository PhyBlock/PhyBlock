Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks in total. It has two layers: a bottom layer with three cylindrical blocks and a top layer with two rectangular blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** Three orange cylindrical blocks (index 7) form the base. They are arranged in a slightly offset \"V\" or \"M\" shape. Two green rectangular blocks (index 1) rest on top of the cylinders, positioned side by side, spanning across the two outer cylinders.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need three orange cylinders and two green horizontal rectangular blocks.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Three blocks with index 7 (orange cylinders).\n    * Two blocks with index 1 (green horizontal rectangular blocks).\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched based on shape, color, and orientation as shown in the dictionary. No rotations are required.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize building a stable base before adding the top layer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence places the three cylindrical blocks first, followed by the two rectangular blocks on top.  The specific placement within the \"V\" of the cylinders is inferred from the target image; any stable arrangement that matches the final configuration is acceptable.\n"

            "text": "Here's a step-by-step analysis and construction plan based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  The first structure has 6 blocks and 3 layers. The second structure has 5 blocks and appears to be a single layer (though some blocks might be stacked slightly behind others).\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure 1):** The structure is a tower. The bottom layer consists of two vertically oriented yellow blocks (index 10).  The next layer has a single, horizontal, red block (index 5). The top layer is composed of three blocks: a small red cube (index 5) is centered over the red block, with a blue cube (index 6) to its left and an orange triangular block (index 13) to its right.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure 2):** This structure is rectangular. It appears to consist of four blocks forming a hollow square. Yellow blocks (index 9) form the top and bottom of the square.  A green block (index 4) is on the right, and a red arch (index 2) is at the bottom. A red cylindrical block (index 11) is inside the frame.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure 1 Needed Blocks:**\n    * Index 10 (Yellow Block, vertical, x2)\n    * Index 5 (Red Block, cube)\n    * Index 6 (Blue Block, cube)\n    * Index 13 (Orange Triangular Block)\n\n* **Structure 2 Needed Blocks:**\n    * Index 9 (Yellow Block, horizontal, x2)\n    * Index 4 (Green Block, cube)\n    * Index 2 (Red Arch)\n    * Index 11 (Red Cylindrical Block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order must be bottom-up for structural stability. This assumes a flat surface to build on.  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1\": {\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n  },\n  \"Structure 2\": {\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n**Note:**  This assembly order prioritizes placing the bottom-most blocks first. For Structure 2, one might place the red arch (2) before the green block (4) if it's easier for placement.  This doesn't change the overall placement or block selection.\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image shows a structure composed of 5 blocks. It has two layers.  The bottom layer consists of two blocks, and the top layer consists of two blocks that are on top of the two blocks from the bottom layer.  There's a single block in the very back, acting as a central support.\n\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * Two identical arch-shaped blocks (presumably index 2) form the base, positioned side-by-side.\n    * A single rectangular block sits atop these arches in the back. (This could be block 8 or 10).\n    * Two identical triangular blocks are placed on top of the arch blocks, creating a \"roof\" effect.  (These are likely index 11)\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n    * Two blocks with index 2 (arch-shaped).\n    * One block with index 8 (single rectangular block to fit on the back).\n    * Two blocks with index 11 (triangular blocks for the roof).\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 2, 2, 8, 11, 11\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order must consider stacking and support.  We need to build the base first, then add the central block for support, and lastly, place the roof pieces.\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2\n  Step2: Move block with index 2\n  Step3: Move block with index 8\n  Step4: Move block with index 11\n  Step5: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\n"

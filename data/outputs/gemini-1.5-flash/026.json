Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 7 blocks in total and has three distinct layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Bottom Layer:** Two identical orange cylindrical blocks (index 10, likely) are placed side-by-side, sitting on a single yellow block (index 3, likely).\n    * **Middle Layer:** A single yellow block (index 3, likely) rests atop the orange cylinders.\n    * **Top Layer:** A red block (index 2, likely) is in the center, flanked by a blue block (index 4, likely) on its right and what looks like another blue block (index 4 or 6, likely) on its left.  Atop the red block sits an orange triangular block (index 13 or 15, likely) oriented with its point upwards. Another identical orange triangular block (same index as above) rests on top to form the roof.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis:\n    * Two orange cylinders (Index 10)\n    * One yellow block (Index 3)\n    * One red block (Index 2)\n    * Two blue blocks (Index 4)\n    * Two orange triangular blocks (Index 13)\n* **List Block Indices:** 10, 10, 3, 2, 4, 4, 13, 13\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched to their visual counterparts in the dictionary without any rotation.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should proceed from bottom to top and layer by layer to ensure stability.\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 3\nStep2: Move block with index 10\nStep3: Move block with index 10\nStep4: Move block with index 3\nStep5: Move block with index 2\nStep6: Move block with index 4\nStep7: Move block with index 4\nStep8: Move block with index 13\nStep9: Move block with index 13\n}"

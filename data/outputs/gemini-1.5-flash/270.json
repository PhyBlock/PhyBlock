Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image shows two separate structures.  The left structure has 5 blocks and 3 layers. The right structure has 5 blocks and 3 layers.  In total, there are 10 blocks across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):** A blue block (forming a small base) sits below an orange block.  A vertical orange triangular prism is on top of the blue block. Two more orange ramps are arranged symmetrically on either side of the vertical orange prism at the base.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):** A yellow block forms the base. A blue block sits on top of and slightly behind the yellow block. A red block with an arch is placed on the right side of the blue block.  A green block sits above the red arch block. An orange triangular prism sits on top of the green block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Left Structure):**\n    * Index 4:  Blue cube\n    * Index 10: Vertical orange rectangular prism\n    * Index 14: Orange ramp (left side)\n    * Index 15: Orange ramp (right side)\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Right Structure):**\n    * Index 7: Yellow cube\n    * Index 6: Blue cube\n    * Index 1: Red block with arch\n    * Index 5: Green cube\n    * Index 16: Orange triangular prism\n\n\n* **Block Indices List:** 4, 10, 14, 15, 7, 6, 1, 5, 16\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nIt's crucial to build each structure independently, as the blocks are specific to each design and cannot be interchanged. The assembly order below reflects a likely building sequenceâ€”other valid orders might exist.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```\n"

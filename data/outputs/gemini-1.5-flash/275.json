Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 13 blocks.  The left structure has 5 layers and the right structure has 6 layers, although considering both as one complete structure it can be also described as having 6 levels of blocks where the left and right structures are independent of each other but situated next to each other in this view.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:** A yellow block with a hole forms the base. On top sits a red block.  Above that is a blue block, followed by a green block, and finally a red triangular block on top, forming a small house-like shape.\n\n    * **Right Structure:** Two orange cylindrical blocks form the base, side by side. On top of these, a yellow block with an arch is placed.  Above the arch sits a red triangular block, and a further red block is placed on top of that. On top of the original two orange cylindrical blocks is another pair of orange cylindrical blocks placed on top of each other, forming a tower.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need to match the blocks from the target image to the blocks in the dictionary image based on shape, color, and orientation.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Left Structure: 9, 5, 3, 7, 14\n    * Right Structure: 11, 11, 1, 14, 5, 11, 11\n\n* **Matching Criteria:**  All blocks are matched exactly to their counterparts in the dictionary without any rotations.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nA step-by-step assembly sequence is presented below, with separate numbering for the left and right structures:\n\n```\n{\n  Left Structure:\n  Step1: Move block with index 9\n  Step2: Move block with index 5\n  Step3: Move block with index 3\n  Step4: Move block with index 7\n  Step5: Move block with index 14\n\n  Right Structure:\n  Step6: Move block with index 11\n  Step7: Move block with index 11\n  Step8: Move block with index 1\n  Step9: Move block with index 14\n  Step10: Move block with index 5\n  Step11: Move block with index 11\n  Step12: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** This assembly order assumes a bottom-up approach for each structure.  Other orders might be possible, but this one logically builds each structure from the base upwards.  The left and right structures can be assembled concurrently or sequentially - the above instructions present both structures consecutively, but this can be adapted based on the context of the assembly.\n"

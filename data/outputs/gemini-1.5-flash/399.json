            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 12 blocks.  Determining the exact number of layers is subjective depending on how you define a \"layer,\" but a reasonable interpretation would be 3-4 layers, depending on how the groupings are perceived.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two distinct sub-structures.\n\n    * **Left Sub-structure:** This starts with a base of two horizontally-aligned blocks. On top of this sits a vertically oriented block, which then supports a horizontally oriented block with two vertically oriented blocks on top of it.  These two blocks on top are topped by a third block.\n\n    * **Right Sub-structure:** This sub-structure consists of blocks stacked horizontally and vertically creating an irregular shape.  It’s characterized by a layered structure, with blocks stacked on top of each other and positioned adjacent to each other.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need to carefully select blocks from the dictionary based on shape, color, and orientation to match the target structure.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**  The following block indices are required (order not important at this stage):\n\n    1.  11 (Yellow curved block)\n    2.  9 (Orange cylinder)\n    3.  7 (Yellow rectangular block)\n    4.  6 (Green rectangular block)\n    5.  5 (Blue cube)\n    6.  3 (Blue cube)\n    7.  13 (Orange triangular block)\n    8.  14 (Orange triangular block)\n    9.  1 (Red curved block)\n    10. 8 (Yellow cube)\n    11. 10 (Orange Cylinder)\n    12. 12 (Red triangular block)\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nInferring the assembly order requires considering which blocks must be placed first to provide support for others.  A possible assembly order (there might be others) could be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  This assembly order is a suggestion and might not be the only correct one.  Some steps might be interchangeable, provided that a step doesn’t rely on another incomplete structure for support.  The key is that the final structure matches the main target image exactly using the specified blocks and orientations.\n"

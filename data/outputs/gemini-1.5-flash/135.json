It has two main layers.  The top layer has three vertical blocks. The bottom layer has five blocks forming a base.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The bottom layer consists of two red arch-shaped blocks side-by-side.\n    * Atop the red arches, there are two yellow semi-circular blocks, also side-by-side.\n    * On the top layer, there are three vertical blocks: a green block in the center and yellow blocks to its left and right, directly above the semi-circular yellow blocks.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need to match the shape, color, and orientation of each block precisely.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Block Index 2 (Red Arch): x2\n    * Block Index 6 (Green Rectangular Block) : x1\n    * Block Index 10 (Yellow Rectangular Block) : x2\n    * Block Index 14 (Yellow Semi-Circular Block) : x2\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly to the orientation as shown in the dictionary.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to ensure structural stability.  Therefore, it is most logical to build from the bottom up.\n\n* **Output Format:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 14\nStep4: Move block with index 14\nStep5: Move block with index 6\nStep6: Move block with index 10\nStep7: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence places the two red arch blocks (index 2) first, forming a base. Then the two yellow semi-circular blocks (index 14) are placed.  The green (index 6) and yellow (index 10) rectangular blocks are then stacked on top, completing the structure.  While other arrangements *might* be possible, this is the most logical and structurally sound method.\n"

            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 12 blocks.  It has a maximum of 3 layers in some areas.\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two distinct parts.  The left part features a base of two red arch blocks (index 1 or 2 likely), upon which yellow arches (index 13) sit. Above this are three vertical blocks: a green block (index 6 or 9), and two yellow blocks (index 10 or 11). The right section is a small house-like structure. It starts with a red arch base (index 1 or 2), on top of which sits a green block (index 6 or 9), and finally an orange roof (index 15).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Blocks:** Based on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n    * Two red arch blocks (index 2): These are the two identical red arches forming the base of each section.\n    * Two yellow arch blocks (index 13):  These form the arch on top of the red blocks on the left.\n    * One green vertical block (index 6):This green block is used in both sections.\n    * Two yellow vertical blocks (index 11): These are the two taller yellow blocks on the left.\n    * One blue block (index 3): This forms the main part of the house-like structure on the right.\n    * One orange roof block (index 15): This is the top of the house-like structure.\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 13, 13, 6, 11, 11, 3, 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to consider which blocks are base layers and which are added subsequently.  There are several possible valid orders, but this emphasizes a bottom-up approach:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The index 6 could just as easily be placed before index 11 in steps 5 and 6.  Several minor variations on this assembly order would also be valid. The most important constraint is to accurately use the correct block index with its given orientation from the dictionary.\n"

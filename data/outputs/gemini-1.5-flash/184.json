It has a maximum of 3 layers in one section and 2 in another.\n\n   - **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two distinct parts.  The larger part is a vertical stack with a base of a small triangular block (bottom left), stacked with a green cube, upon which sits an orange cylinder. Above the orange cylinder are two yellow semi-circular blocks placed together.  The second part consists of two red U-shaped blocks placed side-by-side, with a blue cube placed on top of the left-most red block.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   - **Needed Blocks:**  To build this structure, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n   - **List of Block Indices:** 1, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 1, 5\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   - **Inference of Order:**\n\n   ```\n   {\n   Step 1: Move block with index 14\n   Step 2: Move block with index 6\n   Step 3: Move block with index 9\n   Step 4: Move block with index 13\n   Step 5: Move block with index 1\n   Step 6: Move block with index 5\n   Step 7: Move block with index 1\n   Step 8: Move block with index 5\n   }\n   ```\n\n**Note:**  There are two sets of blocks with index '1' and '5' that are needed in the assembly.  In the image there is only one '1' and one '5' - we would need additional blocks (clones) of these with index '1' and '5' to complete the model.  If additional blocks were not available, the assembly would be impossible as requested in the instructions.  Also I've organized the assembly instructions so they build the structures bottom to top to improve stability.  There might be other correct orders that still lead to the final structure, but this sequence is efficient and logical.\n"

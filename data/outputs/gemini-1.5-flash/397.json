Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 10 blocks.  The left structure has 5 blocks arranged in multiple layers, while the right structure has 5 blocks in a single layer.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:** A red arch-shaped block (base). On top of this are a green block, and then an orange triangular block.  Atop the orange triangle is a smaller orange rectangular block. Finally, a tall orange cylinder is placed on top of the smaller orange block.\n\n    * **Right Structure:** A yellow rectangular block forms the base. Above it are: a red square block, a green square block, and a blue square block. These are stacked vertically above one another, filling the yellow block's opening.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Needed Blocks:**  To construct the target structure, we need the blocks from the dictionary as follows:\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Block 1: Red arch\n    * Block 6: Green rectangular block\n    * Block 14: Small orange rectangular block\n    * Block 13: Orange triangular block\n    * Block 12: Orange cylinder\n    * Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (large)\n    * Block 5: Red square block\n    * Block 7: Green square block\n    * Block 4: Blue square block\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to be determined following a bottom-up approach for each structure.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 4\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that each block is placed in the correct position relative to the others.  Remember,  we cannot rotate the blocks - they must be placed as they appear in the dictionary.\n"

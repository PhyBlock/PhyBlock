            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses six blocks and has two layers.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  The structure is essentially an \"H\" shape.  The bottom layer consists of two identical red blocks (arch-shaped) placed side-by-side. The top layer also consists of two identical red blocks (arch-shaped), placed on top of, and aligned with, the bottom blocks. A yellow rectangular block spans the space between the two red blocks in both layers, acting as a bridge.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n    * Two red blocks with arch shape oriented as shown in index **2**.\n    * Two red blocks with arch shape oriented as shown in index **2**.\n    * One yellow rectangular block oriented horizontally as shown in index **9**.\n    * One yellow rectangular block oriented horizontally as shown in index **9**.\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 2, 2, 9, 9, 2, 2\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nConsidering the structure's stability and how blocks would practically be placed, a reasonable assembly order is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence places the bottom yellow block first, providing a stable base for the rest. Then, it adds the bottom red blocks, followed by the top yellow block, and finishes with the top red blocks.  Note there are many possible \"correct\" assembly orders. This one is considered practical for building.\n"

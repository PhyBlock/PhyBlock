Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks in total, arranged across two distinct sections.  The left section has 5 layers while the right section has 3.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Section:** A red arched block (base) supports a green cube, which in turn supports two more green cubes. On top of these is a red block with an orange roof-like piece on top.\n\n    * **Right Section:** A yellow block acts as a base, supporting a red block, a blue block, and a green block stacked vertically.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on visual comparison:\n\n    * Index 2: Red arched block\n    * Index 6: Green cube\n    * Index 6: Green cube\n    * Index 6: Green cube\n    * Index 7: Red cube (small)\n    * Index 14: Orange roof piece\n    * Index 11: Yellow block\n    * Index 7: Red cube (small)\n    * Index 5: Blue cube\n    * Index 9: Green block (long)\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 2, 6, 6, 6, 7, 14, 11, 7, 5, 9\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to consider the layering and support structures.  While there might be multiple valid orders, here's a plausible one:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 9\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact same blocks from the dictionary need to be used without any rotation.  The assembly order prioritizes building from the bottom up for each section of the structure.  Alternative orders are possible as long as they maintain structural integrity and don't require any block rotation.\n"

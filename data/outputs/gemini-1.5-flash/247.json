            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, following the specified steps:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 10 blocks.  The \"house\" portion is three layers high, while the \"pillar\" structure is four layers high.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The structure is composed of two distinct parts: a taller, pillar-like structure to the left and a smaller, house-like structure to the right.\n    * **Left Structure (Pillar):** Three orange cylindrical blocks form the legs, supporting a yellow rectangular block. On top of this is another orange cylindrical block topped with a yellow half-cylinder.\n    * **Right Structure (House):** Two orange cylindrical blocks form the base, supporting a yellow rectangular block. A red square block sits on top of the yellow block, followed by a blue square block, and finally a triangular orange block forming the roof.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the description above, we need the following blocks:\n    * Three orange cylinders (index 10)\n    * Two yellow rectangular blocks (index 7)\n    * One yellow half-cylinder (index 11)\n    * One red square block (index 1)\n    * One blue square block (index 3)\n    * One orange triangular block (index 14)\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 10, 10, 10, 7, 11, 1, 3, 14, 7, 10 (added an extra 10 to account for 3 orange cylinders)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to build from the bottom up for stability in both structures:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** This assembly order prioritizes building the base of each structure first before adding the subsequent layers.  There might be slight variations in the order for some blocks, but the overall strategy should remain the same to ensure stability. Also, there is some ambiguity in the instructions. The indexes can be assigned in a slightly different way to accommodate for more than one of the same kind of block. For the sake of clarity, this response assumes a specific order.\n"

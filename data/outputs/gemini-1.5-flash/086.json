Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 7 blocks and has 4 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Layer 1 (Base):** Two identical blue blocks (index 5) are placed side-by-side, leaving a space between them.\n    * **Layer 2:** A yellow block (index 9) rests atop the blue blocks, spanning the gap between them.\n    * **Layer 3:** A red block (index 3) is centered on the yellow block.  A blue block (index 6) is placed to the left of the red block, sitting atop the left blue block from layer 1.\n    * **Layer 4 (Top):** A green block (index 7) sits on top of the red block, followed by an orange block (index 13) on top of the green block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need blocks matching the colors and orientations from the target image.\n\n* **List Block Indices:** The required blocks are: 5, 5, 9, 3, 6, 7, 13\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are selected to precisely match their shape, color, and orientation in the dictionary image.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should build from the bottom up, ensuring stability:\n\n{\n   Step 1: Move block with index 5\n   Step 2: Move block with index 5\n   Step 3: Move block with index 9\n   Step 4: Move block with index 3\n   Step 5: Move block with index 6\n   Step 6: Move block with index 7\n   Step 7: Move block with index 13\n}\n"

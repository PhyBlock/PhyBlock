            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target structure uses 14 blocks.  It's not easily defined by a strict number of layers due to the staggered arrangement, but we can consider it having a maximum of three vertical levels in certain sections.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two main sections. The larger left section is a more complex arrangement with house-like shapes created using blocks stacked vertically and horizontally.  The smaller right section uses a base of two arch-shaped blocks, upon which are stacked rectangular blocks creating a smaller, simpler tower-like structure. The blocks interlock and are spatially arranged in a 3D configuration.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** To reconstruct the target structure, we need blocks from the dictionary that exactly match in shape, color, and orientation.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**  The block indices required are as follows, noting that the same index may be used more than once:\n\n    * **Left Section:** 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14\n    * **Right Section:** 2, 3, 8, 5\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** Each block index is selected based on a perfect match with its shape, color, and orientation as shown in the dictionary image.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nInferring a precise assembly order requires some assumptions about stability.  A bottom-up approach is generally safest. Here's a possible assembly sequence; there might be slight variations that still result in a stable structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** This assembly order prioritizes a stable build.  Other sequences might be possible, but this aims for minimizing the risk of collapse during construction.  The placement of blocks 5 (twice) and 5 may need slight adjustments based on the precise dimensions and stability of the blocks, not fully defined in the images provided.\n"

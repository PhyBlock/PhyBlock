Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 5 blocks in total.  It has one central layer and four blocks forming a second layer around the central block.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** A green square block (presumably index 2) sits at the center. Four orange triangular blocks (likely index 9, 10, 11, 12, but specific orientation must be determined) are arranged around the central block, each sharing one edge with the central block.  Their positioning suggests that the vertices of the triangles are pointing outward.  Each orange triangular block is placed with the single vertex pointing away from the central block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need one green square block and four orange triangular blocks.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Green Square: Index 2\n    * Orange Triangular Blocks: Index 9, 10, 11, and 12\n\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** The images clearly show the necessary orientations without requiring any rotations.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order depends on a stable base.  Since the four orange blocks meet at the center block, we have a choice on how to start.  The instructions below suggest placing one orange block, then the next adjacent, to create a stable base before adding the final two. You could also place opposite blocks first, then filling in, but the order below is easier to visualize and perform.\n\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2 (green square)\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n}\n\n\nThis order allows for a stable construction.  Placing the central block first provides a solid base for the surrounding triangular blocks.  The orange triangular blocks are then added sequentially,  building upon existing support.\n"

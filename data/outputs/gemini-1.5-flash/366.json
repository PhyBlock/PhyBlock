The taller structure has 4 layers, while the smaller structure has 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Taller Structure:** A yellow cylindrical block (base) supports two more yellow cylindrical blocks.  On top of this base are stacked a green cube, a blue cube, and finally a yellow half-cylinder.\n    * **Smaller Structure:** A triangular orange block is the base.  A green rectangular block is placed horizontally across the mid-section of the triangle. Another orange triangular block is placed on top, forming a complete triangle structure.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis of the main target image and the block dictionary:\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Taller structure: 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 1, 9\n    * Smaller structure: 13, 4, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order must be based on gravity and structural integrity.  It's crucial to place the support blocks first before stacking the next layer.\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index {8}\nStep2: Move block with index {8}\nStep3: Move block with index {8}\nStep4: Move block with index {8}\nStep5: Move block with index {2}\nStep6: Move block with index {1}\nStep7: Move block with index {9}\nStep8: Move block with index {13}\nStep9: Move block with index {4}\nStep10: Move block with index {14}\n}\n"

            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 7 blocks.  The structure has two distinct parts, which can be considered as two separate 2-layer structures and one 1-layer structure.  The larger structure has 3 layers (if we consider each block placement as a layer).\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Structure 1 (Left):** A yellow block (base) supports two orange cylindrical blocks.  On top of the orange blocks sits an arch-shaped red block (2), and finally, an orange triangular block (14) sits atop the arch.\n    * **Structure 2 (Right):** A yellow block forms the base.  A green block is placed on one side of the yellow block, and another yellow block placed on the opposite side.  Lastly, a red cylindrical piece with a hole is situated between the two yellow blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the visual analysis:\n    * Structure 1:\n      * Yellow rectangular block (10)\n      * Two orange cylindrical blocks (11)\n      * Red arch-shaped block (2)\n      * Orange triangular block (14)\n    * Structure 2:\n      * Yellow rectangular block (10)\n      * Green rectangular block (6)\n      * Yellow rectangular block (10)\n      * Red cylindrical block with hole (4)\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [10, 11, 11, 2, 14, 10, 6, 10, 4]\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are selected to match exactly the orientation, shape, and color as shown in the target image and the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nAssembly order can vary slightly depending on the stability preferred during construction.  However, a logical sequence would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\nThis order prioritizes building stable bases before adding upper layers.  It also separates the assembly of the two independent structures.  Other valid orderings may exist, but this one aims for structural stability during construction.\n"

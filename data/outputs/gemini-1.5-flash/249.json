The first is a two-layered structure with two blocks.  The second is a three-layered structure with five blocks.  In total, there are seven blocks and a maximum of three layers across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (left):** A red block (presumably hollow) forms the base. A green block fits inside the hollow portion of the red block.\n\n    * **Structure 2 (right):** Two orange cylindrical blocks form the base. A yellow block sits atop the cylinders, and then a blue block is placed on top of the yellow block. Lastly a curved yellow block rests on top of the blue and yellow blocks.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on visual comparison with the block dictionary:\n\n    * **Structure 1:**\n        * Red block: Index 7\n        * Green block: Index 8\n\n    * **Structure 2:**\n        * Orange cylindrical blocks: Index 13 (x2)\n        * Yellow block: Index 11\n        * Blue block: Index 6\n        * Yellow curved block: Index 14\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [7, 8, 13, 13, 11, 6, 14]\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should consider which blocks must be laid down first to support other blocks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 8\"\n}\n```\n\nThis order places the base cylinders first, then builds upwards, and finally adds the two-block structure.  This assumes a \"bottom up\" building approach.  Slight variations in order might be possible within the constraints of the problem, but this version represents the most logical and structurally sound sequence.\n"

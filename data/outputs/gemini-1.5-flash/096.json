Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses six blocks.  It has two distinct layers. The base layer has three blocks arranged next to each other. The top layer has three blocks; two rest on the base layer and one sits atop them.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The bottom layer consists of a triangular block (orange), a green rectangular block, and a blue square block arranged left-to-right.\n    * The top layer has a yellow square block resting on the green and blue blocks and a red 'U' shaped block is on top of the yellow square block. Finally a red cylindrical block stands next to the other blocks.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need blocks matching the shape, color, and orientation in the target image.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Orange Triangle: Index 16\n    * Green Rectangular Block: Index 9\n    * Blue Square Block: Index 6\n    * Yellow Square Block: Index 7\n    * Red 'U' shaped block: Index 2\n    * Red Cylindrical Block: Index 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should ensure stability.  It's best to build the base first, then add the upper levels sequentially.\n\n{\n   Step 1: Move block with index 16\n   Step 2: Move block with index 9\n   Step 3: Move block with index 6\n   Step 4: Move block with index 7\n   Step 5: Move block with index 2\n   Step 6: Move block with index 13\n}\n\n"

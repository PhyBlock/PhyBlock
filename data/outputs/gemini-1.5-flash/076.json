            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses five blocks and has two layers.  The central red block with a hole forms the core of the structure with the other blocks arranged around it.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The yellow block (likely index 13 or 16) forms the base. A green block (likely index 9 or 10) and a red curved block (likely index 5 or 6) are placed on the left and right side of the central red block, respectively.  Another green block (likely index 9 or 10) is placed on top of the central red block, atop the first green block. A yellow block is placed on top to complete the structure. The red block with the hole is central and partially visible through the other blocks.\n\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n\n    * Yellow Block (Horizontal): Index 13 or 16\n    * Green Block (Vertical): Index 9 or 10 (x2)\n    * Red Block with Hole (Vertical): Index 5 or 6\n    * Red Block (Horizontal): Index 14\n\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:**  To build it with minimal parts, I would pick Index 13, 9, 6, 9, and 13.  (It would work the same using Index 16 instead of 13, 10 instead of 9, 5 instead of 6.  But I will assume the minimum needed to build is using indices 13, 9, 6, 9, and 13. )\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\nThis order assumes that the blocks are placed in the following manner:\n\n1. Place the yellow horizontal block (13) as the base.\n2. Place the green vertical block (9) on the left.\n3. Place the red curved block (6) on the right.\n4. Place the second green vertical block (9) on top of the red-holed block, overlapping the first green block.\n5. Finally, place the second yellow horizontal block (13) on top.\n\n\nNote: The image resolution isn't high enough to definitively distinguish between indices 13 and 16, or 9 and 10, or 5 and 6.  Therefore, any of those similar variations would likely work, provided you select only one of those similar indices.  The assembly instructions are generic enough to accommodate these small variations.\n"

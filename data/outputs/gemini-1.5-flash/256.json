It has a maximum of 3 layers in some areas (the main tower) and 2 layers in the horizontal part.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure consists of two distinct parts.  The first is a tower-like structure: it has a yellow block on top, red blocks forming an arch at its base, and another red block underneath, forming a two-layered base. The second part is a horizontal structure composed of four blocks in a row. These blocks include: a green, red, blue, and yellow block. These are also arranged with an additional red arch at the base.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  To construct the target structure, we need the following blocks (based on shape, color, and orientation):\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Yellow Top Block: 14\n    * Red Arch Bottom (Tower): 2, 2\n    * Central Red Block (Tower): 6\n    * Red Arch Bottom (Horizontal): 2, 2\n    * Green Block: 9\n    * Red Block: 10\n    * Blue Block: 8\n    * Yellow Block: 11\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize building from the bottom up and then combining the two sections:\n\n\n{\n   Step 1: Move block with index 2\n   Step 2: Move block with index 2\n   Step 3: Move block with index 6\n   Step 4: Move block with index 14\n   Step 5: Move block with index 2\n   Step 6: Move block with index 2\n   Step 7: Move block with index 9\n   Step 8: Move block with index 10\n   Step 9: Move block with index 8\n   Step 10: Move block with index 11\n}\n\n**Note:** This assembly order assumes the structure is assembled on a flat surface.  There might be alternative valid assembly sequences, but this one is relatively straightforward and follows a logical build order.  Also, the arches (index 2) must be placed correctly from the start to support the other blocks.\n"

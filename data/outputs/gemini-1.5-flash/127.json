Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks arranged in approximately 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * A yellow block forms the base.\n    * A red block sits atop the yellow block, slightly offset to one side.\n    * A green block sits atop the yellow block, directly on top of the rear portion of it and also a little to one side, slightly offset to the red block.\n    * Two blue blocks are stacked vertically atop the green block.\n    * An orange triangular block rests against the right side of the red block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Blocks:**\n    * Yellow Block: Index 9\n    * Red Block: Index 10\n    * Green Block: Index 6\n    * Blue Block: Index 2 (used twice)\n    * Orange Triangular Block: Index 14\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 9, 10, 6, 2, 2, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize stability.  We start with the base and work upwards,  adding supports as necessary.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\" \n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The image resolution and the slight differences in perspective makes precise judgement slightly challenging. If there is any minor deviation or differences, my analysis is based on the closest match available within the block dictionary.\n"

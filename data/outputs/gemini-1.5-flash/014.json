It has two layers.  The base layer has one block, and the upper layer has three blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure resembles a small house. The bottom layer consists of a single arched block (forming the base). The top layer consists of three blocks: one rectangular block sitting centrally on top of the arch, and two triangular blocks positioned symmetrically on either side of the rectangular block, forming the roof.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need:\n    * One arched block oriented as in the main image.\n    * One rectangular block oriented as in the main image.\n    * Two triangular blocks oriented as in the main image.\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Arched Block: Index 1\n    * Rectangular Block: Index 8\n    * Triangular Blocks: Index 9 (x2)\n\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched in terms of shape, color, and orientation exactly as shown in the dictionary.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nA logical assembly order would be bottom-up:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\"\n}\n```\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  The first structure uses 4 blocks and has 2 layers (if you consider the triangle base as a layer), the second structure uses 6 blocks and has 4 layers.  In total there are 10 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Left):** A triangular block (pointing down) forms the base.  On top of the triangle is a vertical, rectangular block with two smaller, horizontal rectangular blocks attached to it at its center.\n\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Right):**  A vertical stack of rectangular blocks. The bottom two are orange, then a green block, a yellow block and finally the top two are orange (forming a small house shape).  It's a straightforward columnar arrangement.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n\n    * Structure 1:\n        * Block 11: Orange triangular block (base)\n        * Block 7: Orange cylindrical block (center vertical)\n        * Block 5: Blue rectangular block (left horizontal)\n        * Block 6: Blue rectangular block (right horizontal)\n\n    * Structure 2:\n        * Block 10: Orange rectangular block (bottom)\n        * Block 10: Orange rectangular block (second from bottom)\n        * Block 2: Green rectangular block\n        * Block 4: Yellow rectangular block\n        * Block 3: Orange rectangular block (second from top)\n        * Block 3: Orange rectangular block (top)\n\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a possible assembly sequence. Note that there might be alternative valid orders, but this one prioritizes building the base of each structure first.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 3\"\n}\n```\n"

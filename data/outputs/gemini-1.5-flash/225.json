Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two separate structures.  The smaller structure uses three blocks and has three layers. The larger structure uses five blocks and has three layers.  In total, there are eight blocks across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Smaller Structure:** A blue block (top layer), on top of a yellow block (middle layer), on top of a red arched block (bottom layer).\n\n    * **Larger Structure:** Two red arched blocks are placed side-by-side forming the base (bottom layer). A yellow block rests on top of the arches in the middle layer, spanning the gap between them. Another red arched block is placed on top of the yellow block, completing the top layer.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**\n\n    * **Smaller Structure:**\n        * Blue cube: Index 7\n        * Yellow cube: Index 11\n        * Red arched block: Index 2\n\n    * **Larger Structure:**\n        * Red arched block: Index 2 (x2)\n        * Yellow block: Index 11\n        * Red arched block: Index 2 (x1)\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 7, 11, 2, 2, 11, 2\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order can be determined building each structure separately. Since the instructions say that the smaller structure is to the left of the bigger structure, the smaller structure will be built first. The assembly instructions are as follows:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11 on top of block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7 on top of block with index 11\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2 on top of block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 11 on top of block with index 2\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2 on top of block with index 11\"\n}\n```\n"

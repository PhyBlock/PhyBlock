            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image shows two separate structures.  The left structure uses 4 blocks and has 2 layers. The right structure uses 6 blocks and has 4 layers. In total, the image contains 10 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:** A triangular block (point down) forms the base.  A green square block sits on top of the lower left portion of the base. A blue square block is placed on top of the green block.  A triangular block (point up) sits atop the blue block and the right-side of the base block. The blocks are stacked vertically and horizontally to form a small structure.\n\n    * **Right Structure:** A red block with an arched bottom forms the base. A yellow block is positioned on top, creating a horizontal layer. A green block sits on top of the yellow block, centrally located. A red block sits atop the green block. Finally, a reddish-orange gable-shaped block is placed on top of the red block.  The right structure has a clearly defined vertical stacking order, with each block directly on top of the one beneath.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n\n    * Left Structure:\n        * Index 13 (base, triangular block point down)\n        * Index 7 (green square block)\n        * Index 6 (blue square block)\n        * Index 14 (top, triangular block point up)\n\n    * Right Structure:\n        * Index 2 (base, red arch)\n        * Index 8 (yellow block)\n        * Index 7 (green square block)\n        * Index 1 (red square block)\n        * Index 11 (reddish-orange block gable shape)\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize the foundation and stack vertically.  Considering this, here's a possible assembly order, noting I have tried to use a logical bottom up order. For the left structure, the blocks could reasonably be assembled in any order apart from the base. The right structure is more strictly defined by stacking requirements:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```\n"

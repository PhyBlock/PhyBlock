            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, following the specified steps:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 10 blocks.  It's not easily categorized into distinct layers due to the staggered arrangement, but we can describe it sectionally.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure can be conceptually divided into two parts:\n\n    * **Part 1 (House-like structure):** This part consists of a base (block 2), a middle section (block 5), a blue cube (block 4) atop the middle section and a red triangular roof (block 14) on top of the blue cube. A second, smaller red triangular roof (block 13) is placed next to the larger one on top of the blue cube.\n\n    * **Part 2 (Vehicle-like structure):** This part has two orange cylindrical blocks (block 9) forming the base, a yellow block (block 11) on top, another blue cube (block 4) on top of the yellow block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis above:\n\n    * Block 2 (Red Arch)\n    * Block 5 (Green Block)\n    * Block 4 (Blue Cube)\n    * Block 14 (Red Triangle Roof - larger one)\n    * Block 13 (Red Triangle Roof - smaller one)\n    * Block 9 (Orange Cylinder) x2\n    * Block 11 (Yellow Block)\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 2, 5, 4, 14, 13, 9, 9, 11\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are chosen to match the target image's shape, color, and orientation exactly.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nA logical assembly order, considering stability and placement, would be:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 9\n  Step2: Move block with index 9\n  Step3: Move block with index 2\n  Step4: Move block with index 5\n  Step5: Move block with index 11\n  Step6: Move block with index 4\n  Step7: Move block with index 13\n  Step8: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** This assembly order prioritizes placing the base blocks first and then constructing upwards.  There might be other valid assembly orders depending on the building technique, but this is a sensible approach based on structural stability.  The slight overlap of blocks 13 and 14 on top of the blue cube (Block 4) needs to be considered and may require subtle adjustments.\n\n**Important:** This response assumes the image quality allows for confident identification of the block indices. Any slight ambiguity in the images could slightly alter the analysis.\n"

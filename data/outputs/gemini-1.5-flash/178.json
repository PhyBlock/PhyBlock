Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two separate structures.  The first structure has 4 blocks and 4 layers. The second structure has 4 blocks and 3 layers.  In total there are 8 blocks and a maximum of 4 layers when combined.\n\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Left):** A red arch-shaped block (base), a green rectangular block on top of the arch, a blue square block on top of the green block, and an orange triangular block (house roof) on top of the blue block.\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Right):** A red arch-shaped block (base), a yellow square block to the right of the arch, a blue square block on top of the yellow block, and another blue square block to its left and on top of the arch.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Blocks:**\n\n    * **Structure 1:**\n        * Index 2: Red arch-shaped block\n        * Index 7: Green rectangular block\n        * Index 6: Blue square block\n        * Index 13: Orange triangular block\n\n    * **Structure 2:**\n        * Index 2: Red arch-shaped block\n        * Index 9: Yellow square block\n        * Index 6: Blue square block (2 needed)\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 2, 7, 6, 13, 2, 9, 6, 6\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should build each structure independently, from bottom to top.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the left structure and then the right structure.  Each step adds a block to its corresponding location as per the spatial relationships described above.  Note that the index 6 (blue block) is used multiple times, reflecting its usage in the main image.\n"

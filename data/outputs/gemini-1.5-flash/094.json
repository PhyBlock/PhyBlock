It has three main layers, plus a smaller top layer.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The bottom layer consists of four identical orange cylindrical blocks (index 5 or 7, assuming the image shows the orientation correctly).\n    * The second layer has a yellow rectangular block (index 3) positioned centrally on top of the bottom layer.\n    * The third layer features another orange block (same as the bottom layer) is situated centrally on top of the yellow block from the second layer.\n    * The top layer consists of a yellow semi-circular block (index 9) placed on top of the upper orange block and a red triangular prism (index 14) that leans on the right side of the yellow block of the second layer.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need four orange cylindrical blocks (index 5 or 7), one yellow rectangular block (index 3), one yellow semi-circular block (index 9), and one red triangular prism (index 14).\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 9, 14, 7 (or 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 9, 14, 5).  We can use either index 5 or 7 for the cylindrical blocks, the image resolution makes it difficult to be certain.\n\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks match the shape, color, and orientation in the dictionary image.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly sequence logically proceeds from bottom to top and from left to right or in any order that maintains stability, placing the blocks on a stable base as it builds up.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  The order of steps 1-4 and the use of index 5 or 7 (in step 6) can be interchanged depending on the chosen placement strategy for the bottom layer. The remaining steps are ordered based on the logical build up of the structure. If index 7 is used in place of 5, change accordingly.\n"

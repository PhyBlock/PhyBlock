            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 10 blocks.  There are four distinct layers in the tall structure and two layers in the small structure.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Tall Structure:** The base is a yellow block (potentially index 9, though we'll confirm in the next step). Above it is a red block with a tunnel (index 2). On top of that is a green block (index 5) sitting vertically, and finally, a red block (possibly index 12, depends on its exact orientation) capped with a smaller orange triangular block (index 15).\n    * **Small Structure:**  This structure consists of a red archway block (index 2), with another, red block (index 2, again) above.  A yellow block (index 7 or 8, depending on orientation) is placed on top, followed by a smaller yellow semi-cylindrical block (index 14).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Blocks:**\n    * Block 2 (Red archway): Used twice.\n    * Block 5 (Green vertical): Used once.\n    * Block 7 (Yellow rectangular): Used once.\n    * Block 9 (Yellow rectangular): Used once.\n    * Block 14 (Yellow semi-cylinder): Used once.\n    * Block 15 (Orange triangle): Used once.\n    * Block 12 (Red rectangular, vertical): Used once.\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 2, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15, 12\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nIt is crucial to build from the base up.  The assembly order must carefully consider the stability of the structure.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  Block index 1 or 3 could possibly be used as a substitute for block 12 based on the viewpoint perspective. Without a perfect top-down image for 12, an unambiguous match cannot be assured.  The orientation of blocks 7 and 9 also depends on the perspective, requiring a high-resolution or clear image of the top to determine exact matches. Block index 12 is assumed from the available evidence."

There are also two vertical \"pillars\" that extend through both layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two vertical pillars (blocks that run top to bottom).  One pillar is green (index 7 or 5), the other yellow (index 14 or 13).  Between the pillars, on both layers, there are horizontal pairs of blocks: blue (index 1) and red (index 2) blocks.  These pairs are stacked vertically above each other, one pair per layer.  The yellow blocks are the same height as the paired blue and red blocks combined.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need one green block, one yellow block, two blue blocks, and two red blocks.  Because orientation matters, we must choose specifically the correctly oriented blocks.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Green Pillar: 7\n    * Yellow Pillar: 14\n    * Blue Block (both): 1\n    * Red Block (both): 2\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nConsidering the structure needs to be built stably, and without floating blocks, a reasonable assembly order would be:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 14\n  Step2: Move block with index 7\n  Step3: Move block with index 1\n  Step4: Move block with index 2\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n  Step6: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence places the vertical pillars first, providing support for the rest of the structure. Then, the blue and red blocks are added, one level at a time, maintaining stability.  While alternative orderings are possible, this prioritizes stability and avoids having blocks float in mid-air until other blocks are added to support them.\n"

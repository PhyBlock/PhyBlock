            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two separate structures.  The first structure has 5 blocks and 2 layers (a central layer and a surrounding layer). The second structure has 3 blocks and 2 layers.  In total there are 8 blocks across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure 1):** Four orange triangular blocks (presumably the same block, just rotated) are arranged around a central square block composed of a blue vertical rectangle with a green square on top.  The triangular blocks form the base. The green square is directly on top of the blue rectangle.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure 2):** A red triangular block sits atop a larger red block with an archway.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure 1:**\n    * Central square block: Index 4 (green square on blue rectangle)\n    * Orange Triangular blocks: Index 12 (this is the only orientation that will work) x 4\n\n\n* **Structure 2:**\n    * Top triangular block: Index 11 (red triangle)\n    * Arch Block: Index 2 (red arch block)\n    * Base rectangular Block: Index 1 (red rectangular block)\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 4, 12, 12, 12, 12, 11, 2, 1\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to be considered for each structure separately, as they are independent of each other.  Below the assembly order is described and structured according to the prompt. There are multiple valid assembly sequences; these instructions represent one option.\n\n\n**Structure 1 Assembly:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n}\n\n\n**Structure 2 Assembly:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n}\n\n\n**Overall Assembly (Combining both structures):** To get a complete assembly sequence for both structures, we can combine the two sequences above.  The order within each structure's sequence must be followed.  Since the structures are independent, the order of assembling structure 1 versus structure 2 is arbitrary.  One potential combined sequence is:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 2\n   Step8: Move block with index 11\n}\n\n"

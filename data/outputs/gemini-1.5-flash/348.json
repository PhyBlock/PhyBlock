            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two separate structures.  Let's call them Structure A (the house-like one) and Structure B (the rocket-like one).\n\n    * **Structure A:** 5 blocks, 2 layers (excluding the roof).\n    * **Structure B:** 5 blocks, 3 apparent layers (if we consider the central cylinder as having height).\n\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure A:**\n        * A blue block forms the base.\n        * A yellow block sits on top of the blue block.\n        * A red block sits partially on top of the blue block and partially adjacent to the yellow block.\n        * A green block rests on top of the yellow block, but slightly offset toward the red.\n        * An orange triangular block sits on top as a \"roof,\" centered over the yellow and green blocks.\n\n    * **Structure B:**\n        * A blue block forms the base, which is not a full layer, but a single block, and is slightly angled.\n        * An orange cylinder is placed vertically upon the base.\n        * Another blue block is placed at the side of the orange cylinder and at the base of the cylinder, also angled slightly to the side.\n        * An orange triangular block is placed on top of the cylinder, offset slightly, forming a peak.\n        * Another orange triangular block is attached to the blue block, supporting the cylinder structure and adding a base.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure A:**\n    * Blue block: Index 6\n    * Yellow block: Index 7\n    * Red block: Index 4\n    * Green block: Index 5\n    * Orange triangular block: Index 13\n\n* **Structure B:**\n    * Blue block: Index 6\n    * Orange cylinder: Index 10\n    * Orange triangular block: Index 14 (top)\n    * Orange triangular block: Index 14 (bottom)\n    * Blue block: Index 6\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to be inferred.  A \"move\" implies placing a block on the structure.  Since we can only place blocks on already positioned blocks without rotating them, the order will be bottom-up, for both structures.\n\n* **Structure A:**\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 6\n      Step2: Move block with index 7\n      Step3: Move block with index 4\n      Step4: Move block with index 5\n      Step5: Move block with index 13\n   }\n\n* **Structure B:**\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 6\n      Step2: Move block with index 10\n      Step3: Move block with index 14\n      Step4: Move block with index 6\n      Step5: Move block with index 14\n   }\n\nNote:  The images are not perfectly clear and some assumptions have been made about precise alignment.  Slight discrepancies may be possible based on interpretation.  Also note that I've addressed the structures separately, as the task doesn't indicate they need to be built simultaneously. If they had to be built in a single sequence, the steps of structure A would need to precede the steps of structure B.\n"

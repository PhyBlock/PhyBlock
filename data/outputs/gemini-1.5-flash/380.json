Let's analyze them individually.\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):** This structure has 5 blocks and 3 layers.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):** This structure has 5 blocks and 3 layers.\n\n**Spatial Relationships:**\n\n**Structure 1:** A blue cube (1) forms the base layer. Four orange triangular prisms (11) are arranged around the base, pointing upwards, forming the second layer. Finally, a single orange triangular prism (11) sits atop these, forming the top layer.\n\n**Structure 2:** Two orange cylindrical blocks (8) form the first layer, side by side. A yellow rectangular block (3) sits atop these, forming the second layer.  Two more orange triangular prisms (12) are placed on top of the yellow block, forming the third and final layer.\n\n\n## Block Selection from the Dictionary:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n* Block 1: Blue cube\n* Block 11: Orange triangular prism (x4)\n* Block 12: Orange triangular prism (x1)\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n* Block 8: Orange cylindrical block (x2)\n* Block 3: Yellow rectangular block\n* Block 12: Orange triangular prism (x2)\n\n\n## Assembly Order:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 11\nStep3: Move block with index 11\nStep4: Move block with index 11\nStep5: Move block with index 11\nStep6: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 8\nStep2: Move block with index 8\nStep3: Move block with index 3\nStep4: Move block with index 12\nStep5: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The assembly instructions are given in a way that is conceptually possible, assuming that blocks can be placed without interfering with already placed blocks.  A real-world construction might require a slightly different order depending on the specific physical constraints of the blocks and the workspace.\n"

            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main image shows two structures built from blocks.  Let's analyze them separately:\n\n* **Structure 1 (Giraffe-like):** This structure has 7 blocks and is essentially 2 layers high.\n    * **Layer 1:** Four orange cylindrical blocks (index 11) arranged in a square.\n    * **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block (index 10) sits atop the central two orange cylinders.\n    * **Layer 3:** A green rectangular block (index 7) vertically placed on top of the yellow block.\n    * **Layer 4:** A yellow block (index 13) on top of the green block.\n\n\n* **Structure 2 (Dragon-like):**  This structure is more complex, with 6 blocks in multiple layers.\n    * **Layer 1:** One orange cylindrical block (index 11).\n    * **Layer 2:** A green cube (index 6) placed on the orange cylinder.\n    * **Layer 3:** A blue cube (index 3) is placed next to and on top of the green cube.\n    * **Layer 4:** A yellow cube (index 5) is placed to the left of the blue cube.\n    * **Layer 5:** A red block (index 2) stacked upon the blue and yellow cubes.\n    * **Layer 6:** A yellow piece (index 15) placed on top of the red piece.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure 1 (Giraffe-like):**\n    * Index 11 (orange cylinder) x 4\n    * Index 10 (yellow rectangular block) x 1\n    * Index 7 (green rectangular block) x 1\n    * Index 13 (yellow block) x 1\n\n* **Structure 2 (Dragon-like):**\n    * Index 11 (orange cylinder) x 1\n    * Index 6 (green cube) x 1\n    * Index 3 (blue cube) x 1\n    * Index 5 (yellow cube) x 1\n    * Index 2 (red block) x 1\n    * Index 15 (yellow block) x 1\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should be from bottom to top and left to right within each layer to ensure stability.  However, the steps do not need to strictly follow every individual block. We can group together the blocks based on each layer. This allows for some flexibility in the construction process (e.g., you may place all the orange blocks in layer 1 at once).\n\n**Assembly Instructions:**\n\n{\nStep 1: Move block with index 11 (four blocks at once)\nStep 2: Move block with index 10\nStep 3: Move block with index 7\nStep 4: Move block with index 13\n\nStep 5: Move block with index 11\nStep 6: Move block with index 6\nStep 7: Move block with index 3\nStep 8: Move block with index 5\nStep 9: Move block with index 2\nStep 10: Move block with index 15\n}\n\n\nThis provides a clear and concise set of instructions for assembling both structures, respecting the given constraints and block indices.  The \"Move block with index {idx}\" format is maintained, even though groups of blocks could theoretically be moved simultaneously in a real-world scenario.\n"

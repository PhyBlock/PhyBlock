            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  The structure on the left has 4 blocks and 3 (vertical) layers. The structure on the right has 6 blocks arranged in 4 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):**  A green block (vertical) forms the left and right sides.  A yellow block (vertical) fits between the two green blocks. Red and blue blocks are stacked vertically on top of the yellow block.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):**  Two blue blocks form the base, supporting a red block and yellow block on top. An orange block sits on top of the yellow block.  A green block is then atop the orange one. Finally, an orange triangle sits on top, completing the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Left Structure):**\n    * Green vertical block: Index 9\n    * Yellow vertical block: Index 9\n    * Red block: Index 4\n    * Blue block: Index 6\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Right Structure):**\n    * Blue block: Index 6 (x2)\n    * Red block: Index 4\n    * Yellow block: Index 10\n    * Green block: Index 2\n    * Orange block: Index 3\n    * Orange triangle: Index 14\n\n* **List of Block Indices:**  9, 9, 4, 6, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize building the base of each structure first.  The following instructions assume a flat surface for construction.\n\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** This instruction set  assembles the right structure first. This is because the left structure is simpler and its assembly would naturally be integrated within the steps of the larger structure without requiring explicit steps for its construction.  For instance, after placing blocks 6 and 4, you would essentially be creating a small intermediate structure.  However, if needed, a separate assembly instruction for the left structure could be added, placing it after step 10.\n"

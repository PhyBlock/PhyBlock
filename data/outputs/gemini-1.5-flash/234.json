Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses a total of 8 blocks.  It has a maximum of 3 layers in one section and 4 in the other.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure consists of two distinct parts.\n\n    * **Part 1 (Left):** This part is two red arch blocks (stacked vertically), with a yellow block on top. These two layers form the base.  On top of that, another red arch block sits.\n\n    * **Part 2 (Right):** This part has a green block as the base. On top of the green block is a red arch block.  Atop that sits a yellow block. Finally, a tall orange cylindrical block is placed on top.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need specific blocks based on their shape, color, and orientation:\n\n    * Two red arch blocks (index 2)\n    * One yellow block (index 10)\n    * One green block (index 7)\n    * One orange cylindrical block (index 12)\n    * One red arch block (index 2)\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [2, 2, 10, 7, 12, 2]\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the visual analysis, a possible assembly sequence is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2 (on top of the first block)\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10 (on top of the stacked blocks)\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2 (on top of the green block)\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12 (on top of the other structure)\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  There might be slight variations in assembly order depending on how one chooses to build, but this sequence follows a bottom-up approach for both structures, ensuring stability.  Building the base sections first before adding the top blocks provides greater stability and ensures that the structures are less likely to collapse.\n"

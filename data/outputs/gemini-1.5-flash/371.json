The left structure has 4 blocks and 3 layers. The right structure has 5 blocks and 4 layers.  In total, there are 9 blocks across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):**\n    * The bottom layer is a red block (it looks like a brick in the image).\n    * The middle layer consists of a blue block placed on top of the red block.\n    * The top layer is a yellow arch placed on top of the blue block.\n    * The very top layer is an orange triangular block placed on top of the blue block.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):**\n    * The bottom layer is a red block.\n    * The second layer is a blue block placed on top of the red block.\n    * The third layer consists of a green block placed on top of the blue block, followed by an orange triangular block placed on top of the green block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Needed Blocks:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:**\n        * Bottom:  Block 12 (red, rectangular)\n        * Middle: Block 4 (blue, square)\n        * Yellow arch: Block 9 (yellow, arch)\n        * Top: Block 14 (orange triangular)\n    * **Right Structure:**\n        * Bottom: Block 12 (red, rectangular)\n        * Middle: Block 4 (blue, square)\n        * Green: Block 6 (green, rectangular)\n        * Top Triangular: Block 14 (orange triangular)\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 12, 4, 9, 14, 12, 4, 6, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order must build from the bottom up for each structure, since blocks are stacked on top of each other.\n\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 12\n  Step2: Move block with index 4\n  Step3: Move block with index 9\n  Step4: Move block with index 14\n  Step5: Move block with index 12 (second structure)\n  Step6: Move block with index 4 (second structure)\n  Step7: Move block with index 6\n  Step8: Move block with index 14 (second structure)\n}\n\n\n"

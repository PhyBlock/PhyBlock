            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the solution based on your provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two separate structures.  The larger structure has 7 blocks and at least 3 layers (it's hard to be completely certain without seeing the back). The smaller structure has 5 blocks and 2 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Larger Structure):** The larger structure has a central red ring (block 1) surrounded by other blocks.  Orange triangular blocks (index 12) form a base.  Above the base and around the ring are a blue block (index 7 or 8), a green block (index 5), and another orange block.  At the top is a smaller orange block.\n\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Smaller Structure):**  The smaller structure has an orange block (index 14) at each corner. The center is a green block (index 5) and is partially hidden under the orange blocks in the image.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Larger Structure):**\n    * Red ring: Index 1\n    * Blue Cube: Index 7\n    * Green Cube: Index 5\n    * Orange Triangular blocks (base): Index 12 (x2)\n    * Orange Triangular block (top): Index 14\n    * Orange cube: Index 11 (x1, assumed, as the orange cube isn't clearly visible)\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Smaller Structure):**\n    * Orange Triangular blocks (corners): Index 14 (x4)\n    * Green Cube: Index 5\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 5, 7, 11, 12, 12, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is based on building from bottom to top, so the base needs to be laid first, and the taller part follows accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** There's ambiguity in the image regarding the exact orientation and the presence of some of the blocks.  For example, the orange cube in the large structure might be another index. I've made the best educated guess based on what's visible.  A clearer image would allow for more certainty in the solution.\n"

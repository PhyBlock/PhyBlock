Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image shows a total of 9 blocks.  The left structure has 3 blocks in one layer, and the right structure has 6 blocks in three layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Left Structure:** Three blocks. Two red curved blocks are placed side-by-side, and a blue cube is placed on top of them, centered between the two curved pieces.\n    * **Right Structure:** Six blocks, arranged to form a frame. The base is a yellow block (15).  A green block (13) rests on top of the yellow block in the center. On top of the green block is a red cube (9).  Two more yellow blocks (15) are stacked vertically on either side of the center structure.  Finally a green block (14) sits on top of the two yellow blocks, completing the frame.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**\n    * Two red curved blocks (index 2)\n    * One blue cube (index 7)\n    * One yellow block (index 15)\n    * Two yellow blocks (index 15)\n    * One green block (index 13)\n    * One red cube (index 9)\n    * One green block (index 14)\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 7, 15, 15, 13, 9, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize building the base layers first before adding upper levels to ensure stability.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence builds the structures from bottom to top, ensuring that each block has a stable base before placing the next.  Note that multiple instances of index 15 are used.  The instructions don't specify which side the blocks are placed.  The image gives a reasonable implication of their placement.\n"

            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 13 blocks.  It's difficult to define exact \"layers\" due to the irregular arrangement, but we can describe it in terms of vertical stacking and horizontal placement.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure can be conceptually divided into three main sections:\n\n    * **Left Section:** A horizontal base (block 1) with two blocks (block 1) stacked above each other in an arch shape.\n    * **Center Section:**  A vertical stack of three blocks (block 10, block 7, then blocks 4 stacked on top of each other). Two additional blocks (blocks 4) are placed next to the central tower. A green block (block 6) is placed across.\n    * **Right Section:** A base block (block 5), and on top is another block (block 14).\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on the visual comparison:\n\n    * Block 1: Arch-shaped red block (used 3 times)\n    * Block 4: Blue cube\n    * Block 6: Green rectangular block (horizontally oriented)\n    * Block 7: Green rectangular block (vertically oriented)\n    * Block 9: Yellow rectangular block (horizontally oriented)\n    * Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (vertically oriented)\n    * Block 5: Red cube\n    * Block 14: Orange triangular block\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 5, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nInferring an assembly order requires consideration of stability.  Blocks need to be placed in an order that prevents collapse.  Several assembly orders could be correct, depending on how you handle stability, but one possible order is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** This assembly order prioritizes building up the main vertical structures first, then adding supporting blocks.  There might be other equally valid assembly sequences.  The crucial point is that blocks are placed without rotation and in the order matching the indices of the chosen blocks in the image.\n"

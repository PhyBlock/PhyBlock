It has two layers. The bottom layer has 3 blocks and the top layer has 5 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The bottom layer consists of two identical red arched blocks (side-by-side) and one yellow block placed to the right.  The top layer has a green, red, blue and yellow block stacked vertically on top of the bottom layer's blocks.  The green block sits atop the left-most red arched block, the red block sits atop the center block, the blue block is on top of the red, and the yellow block sits on top of the yellow bottom block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need the following blocks:\n    * Two red arched blocks (identical)\n    * One yellow block\n    * One green block\n    * One red block\n    * One blue block\n    * One yellow block\n\n* **List Block Indices:** The indices are: 1, 1, 13, 10, 6, 9, 13\n\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched based on shape, color, and orientation as shown in the block dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to build from the bottom up. Here is a suggested assembly order:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\nThis order places the two red arched blocks first, then the bottom yellow block. Afterwards, the blocks on the top layer are added sequentially from left to right, ensuring proper placement based on the target image.\n"

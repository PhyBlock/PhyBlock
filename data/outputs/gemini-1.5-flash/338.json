There are three layers in the main structure (the horse-like shape) and a two layer structure next to it.\n\n**Spatial Relationships:**\n\n* **Main Structure:** The main structure resembles a horse. It has four orange cylindrical blocks forming the legs, supporting two yellow blocks which form the base of the body. Atop the yellow blocks is a green block, and a yellow curved block acts as a neck/head.\n* **Secondary Structure:**  Two red curved blocks support a blue cube.\n\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**Identified Needed Blocks & Block Indices:**\n\n* **Orange Cylindrical Blocks (Legs):** Index 12 (4x)\n* **Yellow Blocks (Body Base):** Index 10 (2x)\n* **Green Block (Body):** Index 9\n* **Yellow Curved Block (Head/Neck):** Index 13\n* **Red Curved Blocks (Base):** Index 1 (2x)\n* **Blue Cube:** Index 4\n\n\n## Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 4\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The order of placing the four orange blocks (index 12) and the two yellow blocks (index 10) is not strictly defined as they are essentially placed simultaneously to form the base. The same applies to the two red curved blocks (index 1).  This assembly sequence prioritizes building the horse-like structure first, then adding the secondary structure.  Alternative sequences focusing on the secondary structure first are also possible.\n"

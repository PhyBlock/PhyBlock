It has a maximum of 3 layers in some sections.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two distinct parts.\n\n    * **Part 1 (Left):** This part is a two-layer structure. The bottom layer has two red arch-shaped blocks (index 2, mirrored). The top layer has a single yellow rectangular block bridging the gap between the arches.\n\n    * **Part 2 (Right):** This part has the following structure: The bottom layer features two green vertical blocks (index 6).  On top of them is a yellow horizontal block (index 8).  Lastly, there's an orange cylinder block (index 10) topped by a yellow curved block (index 14).\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Blocks:**\n\n    * Two instances of block index 2 (red arches)\n    * One instance of block index 8 (yellow horizontal)\n    * Two instances of block index 6 (green vertical)\n    * One instance of block index 10 (orange cylinder)\n    * One instance of block index 14 (yellow curved top)\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 8, 6, 6, 10, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize building layers from bottom to top to ensure structural stability.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n"

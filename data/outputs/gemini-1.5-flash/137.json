            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, following the provided steps:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 12 blocks.  It has three main layers, with some blocks extending above the main layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is essentially a small castle-like building. The base layer consists of two red arch blocks (index 2) side by side.  Atop this,  a layer of larger blocks forms the main body:  a green block (index 6) to the left, then red block (index 7), and  a green block (index 8) to the right. Partially on top of the green (index 6) block and overlapping to the left of the red (index 7) block sits a blue block (index 5). Above the central red block (index 7) are two yellow blocks (index 10 and index 12), stacked vertically,  and to the right of these two yellow blocks is another red block (index 7). Finally, two orange house-shaped blocks (index 16) sit atop the main structure, one on the left, partially overlapping the blue block (index 5) and the other on the right overlapping the second green block (index 8).  The blocks are arranged to create a visually cohesive structure.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on the analysis above, the required blocks are:\n    * Two instances of block index 2\n    * One instance of block index 5\n    * One instance of block index 6\n    * Two instances of block index 7\n    * One instance of block index 8\n    * One instance of block index 10\n    * One instance of block index 12\n    * Two instances of block index 16\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:**  [2, 2, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 16]\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThis assembly order prioritizes stability, placing lower blocks first:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence builds the base, then the main body, and finally adds the top elements.  There might be minor variations in order that still result in a stable structure, but this prioritizes a bottom-up approach.\n"

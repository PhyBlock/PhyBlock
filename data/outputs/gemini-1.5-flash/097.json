It has three distinct vertical levels, which could be considered layers. However, some blocks overlap in a way that makes distinct \"layers\" less clear.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure consists of:\n    * A base layer with a triangular block (orange, pointing left) next to three blocks stacked vertically.  These three blocks are green (horizontal), blue (horizontal), and yellow (horizontal) from bottom to top.\n    * A central vertical column composed of a single orange block (standing upright).\n    * A top layer with two identical curved yellow blocks, on top of a red horizontal block, and  attached to the orange central column.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Blocks:**  To construct the target image, we need the following blocks:\n\n* **List of Block Indices:**\n    * Block 1:  (Curved red piece)\n    * Block 3: (Blue cube)\n    * Block 4: (Yellow cube)\n    * Block 5: (Green rectangular prism)\n    * Block 7: (Orange rectangular prism)\n    * Block 8: (Yellow half-cylinder)\n    * Block 13: (Orange triangular prism)\n    * Block 14: (Orange rectangular prism)\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThis order prioritizes building from the bottom up and layers, to ensure stability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 8\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** There's some ambiguity in the Block Dictionary Image in determining which orange block (#7) is used as the upright middle column, and which (#14) sits underneath the yellow half-cylinders. I've assumed based on size and position of the target image. If there is a clearer image of the specific orientation of the orange blocks, my answer could be updated to be more precise.\n"

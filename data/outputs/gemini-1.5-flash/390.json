The left structure has three layers, and the right structure has four layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:** A red block (with an arch) forms the base. A green block is stacked on top, followed by a yellow block (half-cylindrical) and a red block (with arch).\n    * **Right Structure:** Two orange cylindrical blocks form the base, supporting a yellow block (with an arch).  On top of the yellow block sits a red block forming a small house shape (pointed roof).  Atop the right structure, a tall orange cylindrical block is vertically stacked.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** To reconstruct the target image, we need the following blocks from the dictionary (based on shape, color, and orientation):\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Left Structure: 1, 5, 11, 1\n    * Right Structure: 10, 10, 7, 1, 14, 10\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the following assembly order is proposed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence first builds the right structure from the base upwards and then builds the left structure from the base upwards.  Remember that blocks are stacked based on visual reference of the main target image, and no rotation or modification is allowed.\n"

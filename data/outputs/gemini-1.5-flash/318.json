            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image contains 8 blocks in a two-layered structure.  There's a main structure of 6 blocks and a separate structure of 2 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Main Structure:** A triangular block (base) supports a larger orange block, which in turn supports an orange arch piece. To the left of the central structure, a green rectangular block sits beside a cylindrical block which is adjacent to the base triangle.  A smaller green block is placed on the top right of the cylinder, and an orange triangular block is adjacent to the green block.\n    * **Separate Structure:** A red block with a hollow center sits adjacent to the main structure. Inside this red block, a smaller green and blue block are stacked.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on the visual analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Block 1: Orange arch\n    * Block 5: Green rectangular block (small)\n    * Block 7: Orange rectangular block (large)\n    * Block 8: Green rectangular block (small)\n    * Block 10: Orange cylindrical block\n    * Block 13: Orange triangular block (small)\n    * Block 14: Orange triangular block (large)\n    * Block 3: Red block with hollow center\n    * Block 4: Blue cube\n    * Block 9: Green rectangular block (small)\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**  This is one possible assembly order. There might be other valid sequences.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 9\"\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact assembly order might vary slightly depending on how the blocks are maneuvered, but the above reflects a logical progression based on the placement in the target image. The key is to place the base first, then build upwards and outwards.  The nested blocks (red and green/blue) are placed last.\n"

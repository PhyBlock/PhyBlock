Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image shows two structures.  The first is a small house-like structure composed of 3 blocks and has 2 layers. The second is a giraffe-like structure consisting of 6 blocks and 4 layers.  In total there are 9 blocks in the main image.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (House):** A green block is at the base. An orange triangular block is placed on top of it, and another orange triangular block is placed on top of the first orange block, forming a small house shape.\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Giraffe):** A green block forms the base of each leg. Above the green blocks, two yellow blocks are placed horizontally, forming the body.  A red block sits on top of one yellow block, and a blue block on top of the red. Finally, a yellow half-cylinder (arch) is placed on top of the blue block to make a neck and head shape.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need to match the blocks from the target image to those in the dictionary image using the same rotational orientation.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * House: 14 (orange triangle), 14 (orange triangle), 2 (green cube)\n    * Giraffe: 2 (green cube), 2 (green cube), 5 (yellow block), 5 (yellow block), 3 (red cube), 1 (blue cube), 6 (yellow arch)\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** Each block's orientation, color, and shape precisely match the target image.\n\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a possible assembly order.  Note that for the house, the base is the first thing that goes down and the steps can be swapped if not done in sequence. Other possibilities exist since only gravity is a constraint (no interlocking is shown).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n}\n```\n"

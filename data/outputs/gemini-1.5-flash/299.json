The left structure has 6 blocks across multiple layers (reaching 3 layers high), while the right structure has 5 blocks in 2 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:** A red block forms the base.  On top of the red block is a partially enclosed red block (piece 1). Two blue cubes are placed on top of it. A green block sits on the red block and below the blue cubes. The \"house\" structure on the right consists of two connected red blocks (13 and 3)\n\n    * **Right Structure:** Two orange cylinders form the base. A yellow block sits on top of them. A single blue cube is placed on the yellow block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Needed Blocks:**  Based on the shapes, colors, and orientations in the target image and dictionary:\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nInferring a plausible assembly order (there might be other valid orders):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  Block index 4 (the blue cube) is used twice because two identical blue cubes are present in the main target image.  The order of placing the blue cubes (Step 5 and 6) might be interchangeable, it depends on which one is considered \"on top.\" There's flexibility in other steps as well, as long as the final result matches the target structure.\n"

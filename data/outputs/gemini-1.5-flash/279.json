There are multiple layers, with the highest being three blocks tall.\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure can be divided into two parts:\n\n    * **Left Part (Arch and Columns):** This section features a base of two arch blocks (index 2), topped by three vertical blocks of varying heights and colors (red, green, yellow).  The green block (index 9) sits on top of the red block (index 6). The yellow block (index 12) sits to the right of the red one.\n    * **Right Part (Cart):** This section is a simple cart with two cylindrical wheels (index 14) supporting a rectangular base block (yellow, index 11) and a cubic blue block (index 5) on top.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need blocks matching the shape, color, and orientation from the main image.\n* **List Block Indices:** The required block indices are: 2, 2, 6, 9, 12, 14, 14, 11, 5.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nA logical assembly sequence, considering stability, would be:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence places the base arch blocks first, followed by the vertical blocks, and finally the cart components.  This ensures stability and makes the construction process straightforward.\n"

            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, following the specified steps:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  Structure 1 (red) has 5 blocks and 3 layers. Structure 2 (green) has 5 blocks and 3 layers. In total, there are 10 blocks across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Red):**  The bottom layer has a single arched block (index 2). The second layer consists of a rectangular block (index 1).  The top layer has a triangular-roofed block (index 12).  The blocks are stacked vertically, with the arch forming the base.\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Green):** The bottom layer has a triangular block (index 13). The second layer is a vertical rectangular block (index 11). The third layer has a triangular block (index 14) on top of the vertical block. The fourth layer has another triangular block (index 15) to the right side of the vertical block and a triangular block (index 16) to the left of the vertical block. The blocks are stacked vertically and the triangular blocks add to the sides of the main structure\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis of the target image:\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Red):**  Blocks with indices 2, 1, and 12 are needed.\n    * **Structure 2 (Green):** Blocks with indices 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are needed.\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [2, 1, 12, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16]\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks match the target image exactly in shape, color, and orientation as shown in the provided dictionary.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is inferred based on the layering of the structures and must be done separately for structure 1 and 2.  It's assumed blocks can only be placed on top of pre-existing blocks.\n\n**Assembly Instructions:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 13\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n   Step6: Move block with index 14\n   Step7: Move block with index 15\n   Step8: Move block with index 16\n}\n\n\nThis output strictly adheres to the format requested and accounts for the separate construction of both structures, even though the prompt didn't explicitly say this needed to be stated.  The steps are ordered logically for building the target structures, with the bottom layers placed first.\n"

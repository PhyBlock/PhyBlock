The left structure has 5 blocks and 2 layers. The right structure has 7 blocks and 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):** Four orange triangular blocks form the base, arranged symmetrically with their points inward. A blue square block sits on top of them, and a single orange triangular block is placed on top of that.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):** The base consists of a yellow rectangular block.  On top of this are two vertically oriented orange cylindrical blocks and a vertically oriented green rectangular block placed between them.  Above that are another yellow rectangular block, and finally an orange triangular block on top.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Left Structure):**\n    * Four orange triangular blocks (index 13)\n    * One blue square block (index 1)\n    * One orange triangular block (index 11)\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Right Structure):**\n    * Two yellow rectangular blocks (index 6)\n    * Two orange cylindrical blocks (index 10)\n    * One green rectangular block (index 3)\n    * One orange triangular block (index 11)\n\n* **List of Block Indices (Left structure):** 13, 13, 13, 13, 1, 11\n* **List of Block Indices (Right structure):** 6, 6, 10, 10, 3, 11\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is inferred based on the structural stability and layering.  It's important to build from the bottom up.  The left structure is simpler to assemble first\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 13\n  Step2: Move block with index 13\n  Step3: Move block with index 13\n  Step4: Move block with index 13\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n  Step6: Move block with index 11\n  Step7: Move block with index 6\n  Step8: Move block with index 10\n  Step9: Move block with index 10\n  Step10: Move block with index 3\n  Step11: Move block with index 6\n  Step12: Move block with index 11\n\n}\n\n\nThis assembly order ensures a stable structure.  It is important to note that there might be other slightly different but equally valid sequences depending on the specific constraints of the actual building process, especially for the complex structure.\n"

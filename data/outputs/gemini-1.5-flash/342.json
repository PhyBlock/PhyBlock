            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on your provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses a total of 11 blocks.  It has two distinct parts. The first part has 2 layers and 7 blocks. The second part has 2 layers and 4 blocks.\n\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Part 1 (Larger Structure):** Four orange cylindrical blocks (presumably index 13,14, or 15) form the base.  Atop these, four green rectangular blocks (index 1,2,5, or 6) are arranged in a 2x2 configuration.\n    * **Part 2 (Smaller Structure):** A yellow rectangular block (index 7,8,11, or 12) is placed vertically. Atop this, a green rectangular block (index 1, 2, 5, or 6) is horizontally placed. Another yellow rectangular block (index 7,8,11, or 12) sits atop the green block to complete the vertical portion of the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n\n    * Four orange cylindrical blocks (index 13, 14, or 15) - since orientation doesn't matter and all three are the same we use index 13 four times.\n    * Four green horizontal rectangular blocks (index 1, 2, 5, or 6) - we'll use index 1 four times.\n    * Two yellow vertical rectangular blocks (index 9 or 10) - we'll use index 9 twice.\n    * One green horizontal rectangular block (index 1, 2, 5, or 6) - we'll use index 1 again.\n* **List Block Indices:** 13, 13, 13, 13, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 1\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should prioritize building a stable base before adding upper layers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 9\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  The exact indices are somewhat subjective. Due to the limitations of the image quality and the fact that blocks of the same type are virtually indistinguishable, the indices may need some adjustments if the provided dictionary images are clearer. The essential parts are the choice of blocks and the steps to assemble them.  The order is based on adding stability from bottom to top and from the largest part to the smallest.\n"

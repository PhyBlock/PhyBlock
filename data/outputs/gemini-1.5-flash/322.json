Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 8 blocks.  The main structure is 3 layers high, and the smaller structure is 2 layers high.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Main Structure:** The base consists of two red arched blocks (index 2, presumably). Atop these, a yellow block (index 9 or 10, depending on orientation) is placed centrally.  On top of the yellow block sits a green block (index 7), followed by a blue block (index 6).  Finally, an orange triangular block (index 14) completes the structure on top.\n\n    * **Smaller Structure:** This separate structure consists of a red arched block (index 2) as a base, with a blue block (index 6) on top, and yellow block (index 9 or 10) to the right of the blue block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  To construct the target structure we need the following blocks:\n\n    * Two red arched blocks (index 2)\n    * One yellow block (index 9)\n    * One green block (index 7)\n    * One blue block (index 6)\n    * One orange triangular block (index 14)\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [2, 2, 9, 7, 6, 14]\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to build from the bottom up.  Because the smaller structure can be built independently and then moved, this will be how we order the steps.\n\n{\nStep 1: Move block with index 2\nStep 2: Move block with index 2\nStep 3: Move block with index 9\nStep 4: Move block with index 7\nStep 5: Move block with index 6\nStep 6: Move block with index 14\nStep 7: Move block with index 2\nStep 8: Move block with index 6\nStep 9: Move block with index 9\n\n}\n\n**Important Note:**  There is ambiguity regarding the orientation of the yellow block (index 9 or 10). I've chosen index 9 in the block list and assembly order.  If the orientation in the target image is a better match for index 10, adjust the block index accordingly. The choice will also affect the order of placing the yellow blocks in the smaller structure.\n"

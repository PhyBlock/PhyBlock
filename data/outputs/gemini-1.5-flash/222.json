Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses a total of 8 blocks.  It has 3 distinct vertical sections or “towers”. The tallest tower has four layers. The other two sections have two layers and one layer respectively.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Tallest Tower (Right):** A yellow block forms the base. On top sits an orange block with a central arch. Above that is another orange block forming a roof structure.\n    * **Two-layer section (left):** Two red, half-cylindrical blocks are placed side by side. Above them is a blue cube.\n    * **Single-Layer section (far left):** One red, half-cylindrical block is place on the dark surface.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n    * Block 9: Yellow block (base of tall tower)\n    * Block 2: Orange arched block\n    * Block 14: Orange triangular roof piece\n    * Block 3: Red half-cylinder block (x2)\n    * Block 6: Blue cube\n    * Block 5: red half-cylinder block\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 9, 2, 14, 3, 3, 6, 5\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nTo create a structure, we have to build each of the three towers independently, and then set them next to each other.\nWe need to consider which blocks are placed at the bottom and then work our way up.\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 9\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 14\nStep4: Move block with index 3\nStep5: Move block with index 3\nStep6: Move block with index 6\nStep7: Move block with index 5\n\n}\n"

            "text": "**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 10 blocks. It has 3 layers, although the triangular sides aren't completely stacked one on top of the other.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is roughly triangular.  Two orange triangular blocks (index 13 or 15 and 14 or 16) form the base.  A red cylindrical block with a hole (index 1) sits centrally on the base and in the middle of the structure. On top of this sit a green square block (index 7) and blue square block (index 6). The upper layer is completed by two more orange triangular blocks (index 14 or 16 and 13 or 15) placed above the initial base triangles, forming a kind of 'roof'. Yellow and orange blocks (index 9 and 11 or 12) sit on the left and right sides of the base respectively.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need one of each of the following types of blocks, paying strict attention to orientation:\n\n    * One red cylindrical block with a hole.\n    * One green cube\n    * One blue cube\n    * Two orange triangular blocks (same orientation, as two identical blocks are needed).\n    * Two orange triangular blocks (same orientation, but different from the first two as they are situated higher)\n    * One yellow cube\n    * One orange block (a rectangular prism standing upright)\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * 1 (red cylinder)\n    * 6 (blue cube)\n    * 7 (green cube)\n    * 13 (orange triangle)\n    * 14 (orange triangle)\n    * 15 (orange triangle)\n    * 16 (orange triangle)\n    * 9 (yellow cube)\n    * 11 (orange rectangular prism)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order must ensure stability; some blocks need to be placed before others can be supported.  Given that the orientation of the blocks in the image is specific, this means that the blocks have to be placed in a specific order, otherwise the structure won't be stable.  It would be best to start with the base, then the center, and then the top.\n\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n\n}\n\nNote: This assembly order prioritizes placing blocks to form the stable base first. There might be other equally valid orders, but this aims for structural integrity during construction.  It uses only one orange rectangle (block 11), which makes the assembly steps less verbose and equally valid. The triangles (13,14,15,16) are used twice, as they are used both on the base and on the upper layer.  Only index 11 or 12 would work, depending on how the image was viewed when creating the task."

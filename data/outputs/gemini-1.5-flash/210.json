Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two separate structures.  The first structure consists of 4 blocks and 3 layers. The second structure consists of 5 blocks and 3 layers.  In total, there are 9 blocks across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Left):** A triangular orange block (top), on top of a blue cube, which sits atop a red block with a curved top (acting as an arch). A yellow curved block sits on top of the red arch-block.\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Right):** Two red blocks with curved tops form the base, sitting side-by-side. A yellow rectangular block sits atop them, bridging the gap. Another red curved top block sits atop the yellow block. Lastly, another red curved top block sits on top of the yellow block, completing the structure.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Needed Blocks:** We need to match the blocks based on shape, color, and orientation precisely as they appear in the dictionary image.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Structure 1: 16 (Orange triangle), 6 (Blue cube), 2 (Red arch), 10 (Yellow arch)\n    * Structure 2: 2 (Red arch) x2, 9 (Yellow rectangle), 2 (Red arch) x2\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks selected are an exact match to the blocks in the target image in terms of shape, color and orientation.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to consider which blocks can be placed first to create a stable base for each structure.  Given this constraint, the assembly order would be:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```\n"

We'll focus on the left structure (the \"llama-like\" one) as there's no explicit instruction to build both.\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks in total, arranged across 3 layers.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two orange cylindrical blocks are placed side-by-side.\n    * **Layer 2 (Middle):** A yellow rectangular block rests horizontally atop the two orange cylinders, spanning both.\n    * **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange cylindrical block sits on top of the center of the yellow block.  A smaller, yellow semi-circular block is on top of this cylinder.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the main image:\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**\n    * Two orange cylinders (orientation as shown in the dictionary).\n    * One yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation).\n    * One orange cylindrical block (orientation as shown in the dictionary).\n    * One yellow semi-circular block (orientation as shown in the dictionary).\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 6, 6, 3, 8, 7\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly sequence should reflect the layer-by-layer construction.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\"\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order assumes a bottom-up approach, building the base first and then adding layers accordingly.  This is a logical and practical assembly sequence.\n"

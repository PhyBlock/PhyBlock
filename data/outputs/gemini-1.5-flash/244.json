Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  Let's call them Structure A (the rocket-like one) and Structure B (the castle-like one).\n\n    * Structure A: 6 blocks, 3 layers (approximately, considering some blocks partially overlap).\n    * Structure B: 6 blocks, 3 layers (approximately).\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure A:** A triangular block (base) forms the bottom layer.  Above it is a cylindrical block with a hole, and on top of that is a rectangular block followed by a triangular top. Two semi-circular blocks sit atop the rectangular block.\n\n    * **Structure B:** A block that looks like an arch forms the base.  On top of that is a rectangular yellow block, and on top of the yellow block is a red cylindrical block, and on top of the cylinder, a red triangular block. To the right of the arch is a green block and a yellow block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure A:**\n    * Base: Block 14\n    * Cylinder with hole: Block 1\n    * Rectangular Block: Block 13\n    * Top Triangle: Block 16\n    * Semi-circular Blocks (2): Block 2 (x2)\n\n* **Structure B:**\n    * Arch: Block 2\n    * Yellow Rectangular Block: Block 7\n    * Red Cylinder: Block 11\n    * Top Triangle: Block 16\n    * Green Block: Block 6\n    * Yellow Block: Block 8\n\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 14, 1, 13, 16, 2, 2, 2, 7, 11, 16, 6, 8\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to consider the stability of the structures.  It's best to build from the bottom up.\n\n{\nStep 1: Move block with index 14\nStep 2: Move block with index 1\nStep 3: Move block with index 13\nStep 4: Move block with index 16\nStep 5: Move block with index 2\nStep 6: Move block with index 2\nStep 7: Move block with index 2\nStep 8: Move block with index 7\nStep 9: Move block with index 11\nStep 10: Move block with index 16\nStep 11: Move block with index 6\nStep 12: Move block with index 8\n}\n\n\n**Important Note:** The images are a bit low-resolution, making some color distinctions subtle. I've tried my best to accurately identify block colors and orientations.  If higher-resolution images were available, the accuracy could be improved.  Block index 2 is used multiple times because there are multiple uses for that block in the Structure A and Structure B.\n"

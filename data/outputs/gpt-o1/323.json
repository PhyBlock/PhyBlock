        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how to reproduce exactly what is shown in the target image using the Dictionary blocks (with no rotations other than those shown). I have broken it into three parts: (1) a detailed description of the finished structure, (2) which Dictionary blocks (by index) are needed, and (3) one possible step‐by‐step assembly order.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Overall, there are two separate “mini‐buildings,” each stacked in layers:\n\n  LEFT BUILDING (7 blocks total; 4 layers):\n   – Layer 1 (bottom): two red arch blocks side by side.  \n   – Layer 2: one yellow rectangular plank laid across (bridging both arches).  \n   – Layer 3: three cubes on top of the plank (green ‐ blue ‐ green).  \n   – Layer 4 (top): one orange wedge block forming a “roof.”\n\n  RIGHT BUILDING (7 blocks total; 5 layers):\n   – Layer 1 (bottom): one yellow rectangular plank.  \n   – Layer 2: two orange cylinders standing vertically on top of the plank.  \n   – Layer 3: another yellow plank bridging the two cylinders.  \n   – Layer 4: one red arch block on top.  \n   – Layer 5 (top): two orange wedge blocks meeting in the center to form a roof peak.\n\n• Total Blocks Used: 14.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) SELECTING THE REQUIRED DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMatched strictly by color, shape, and orientation (no rotation allowed):\n\nA) LEFT BUILDING\n   • Red arches: Block #1 used twice.  \n   • Yellow bridging plank: Block #10 used once.  \n   • Green cubes: Block #6 used twice.  \n   • Blue cube: Block #5 used once.  \n   • Orange wedge “roof”: Block #15 used once.\n\nB) RIGHT BUILDING\n   • Yellow planks (base & bridge): Block #10 used twice more.  \n   • Orange cylinders (columns): Block #12 used twice.  \n   • Red arch: Block #1 used once more.  \n   • Orange wedges (split roof): Block #15 used once more + Block #16 used once.\n\nHence the indices needed:\n\n • #1  (red arch) ‒ 3 total  \n • #5  (blue cube) ‒ 1 total  \n • #6  (green cube) ‒ 2 total  \n • #10 (yellow plank) ‒ 3 total  \n • #12 (orange cylinder) ‒ 2 total  \n • #15 (orange wedge) ‒ 2 total  \n • #16 (orange wedge) ‒ 1 total  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one logical order, building from the ground up, left structure first, then right:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1   (place first red arch, left building base)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 1   (place second red arch, left building base)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 10  (place yellow plank bridging the two arches)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 6   (place first green cube on top)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 5   (place blue cube in the middle)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 6   (place second green cube)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 15  (place orange wedge as roof of left building)\n\n  Step8:  Move block with index 10  (place first yellow plank on ground for right building)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 12  (place first orange cylinder on plank)\n  Step10: Move block with index 12  (place second orange cylinder on plank)\n  Step11: Move block with index 10  (bridge cylinders with second yellow plank)\n  Step12: Move block with index 1   (place red arch on top)\n  Step13: Move block with index 15  (place first orange wedge at rooftop)\n  Step14: Move block with index 16  (place second orange wedge, completing roof)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps with the listed block numbers (and no extra re‐orientation) reproduces the target structure exactly.",

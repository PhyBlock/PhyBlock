        "content": "Below is one way to “read off” the little chair‐shaped model from the two images and match it to the dictionary blocks without rotating any pieces.  First comes a careful breakdown of the target, then exactly which block‐indexes are needed (in their shown orientations), and finally a step‐by‐step build order.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n•  TOTAL BLOCKS & LAYERS  \n   – There are nine total blocks in the structure.  \n   – They stack in four vertical “layers”:  \n     (a) Bottom layer of two red arches (the “legs”)  \n     (b) A ring of four yellow rectangular blocks (the “seat”)  \n     (c) One red arch spanning front–back in the middle (“backrest arch”)  \n     (d) A tall red rectangular block plus a small triangular wedge on top (“backrest column” + “roof”).  \n\n•  SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT  \n   – Bottom Layer (2 Red Arches):  \n     • Front‐left arch is oriented so its curved opening faces forward.  \n     • Front‐right arch is oriented so its curved opening faces right.  \n   – Second Layer (4 Yellow Rectangles forming a “seat”):  \n     • Four identical yellow plank‐blocks arranged in a square ring on top of the arches.  \n   – Third Layer (1 Red Arch in the Middle):  \n     • Sits atop the seat, bridging from front to back (its curved opening also faces forward).  \n   – Top Layer (1 Red Upright + 1 Red/Orange Wedge):  \n     • A tall rectangular red block stands on the arch below.  \n     • A wedge‐shaped “roof” piece caps that upright block.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2.  SELECTING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo match both color and orientation exactly (with no further rotation):\n\n•  RED ARCHES  \n  – Use Index #2 whenever the arch must face front–back.  \n  – Use Index #3 for the arch that must face to the right.  \n  In total we need three arches: two of #2 and one of #3.  \n\n•  YELLOW RECTANGLES (the “seat” planks)  \n  – Use Index #4 for a short yellow rectangular block lying horizontally.  \n  We need four copies of #4.  \n\n•  RED UPRIGHT (the tall rectangular prism)  \n  – Use Index #10.  \n\n•  RED (OR ORANGE) WEDGE (the roof piece)  \n  – Use Index #14 for the wedge oriented with its slope running front‐to‐back.  \n\nPutting this all together, the required block‐index list (with repeats) is:  \n  – Red arches:  #2, #2, #3  \n  – Yellow planks: #4 × 4  \n  – Red upright:  #10  \n  – Roof wedge:   #14  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2   (front‐left red arch)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 3   (front‐right red arch)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 4   (first yellow plank of seat)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 4   (second yellow plank of seat)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 4   (third yellow plank of seat)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 4   (fourth yellow plank of seat)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 2   (red arch spanning front–back on top)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 10  (tall red rectangular column)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 14  (triangular “roof” wedge)  \n}\n\nThat completes the chair‐like arrangement exactly as shown.",

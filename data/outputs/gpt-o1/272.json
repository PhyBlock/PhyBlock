        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how to replicate exactly what is shown in your target image using the blocks (in the orientations) from the dictionary you provided.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n1)  DETAILED ANALYSIS OF TARGET\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n■ Overall Layout\nThe scene has two separate structures:\n\nA)  Red–and–Yellow “Arch Tower” (left):\n   –  Bottom Layer: Two red arch‐shaped blocks side by side.  \n   –  Second Layer: A single yellow rectangular block bridging across the two arches.  \n   –  Third Layer: One tall red rectangular block with a circular “window” through its center.  \n   –  Fourth (Top) Layer: Another yellow rectangular block capping the tower.\n\nB)  Orange “Rocket” (right):\n   –  Center Column: One upright orange cylinder.  \n   –  Side Pieces: Two small blue cubes pressed against opposite sides of the cylinder, each flanked by a taller orange triangular wedge (so the wedge is on the outside, the cube is in between the wedge and cylinder).  \n   –  Top Piece: Another orange triangular wedge perched on the cylinder, forming a “roof.”\n\n■ Block Count and Layers\n–  Arch Tower uses 5 total blocks arranged in four layers.  \n–  Rocket structure uses 6 total blocks (1 cylinder + 2 blue cubes + 3 orange wedges).\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n2)  SELECTING DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nBelow is the exact choice of block‐indices from your dictionary (no re‐orientation allowed):\n\nA)  Arch Tower  \n   •  Two red arches → Block index 1 (used twice)  \n   •  One red “window” block (tall rectangle with circular hole) → Block index 5 (used once)  \n   •  Two yellow rectangular blocks → Block index 7 (used twice)  \n\nB)  Rocket  \n   •  One upright orange cylinder → Block index 8 (used once)  \n   •  Two small blue cubes → Block index 6 (used twice)  \n   •  Three orange triangular wedges: one for the top “roof” and a mirrored pair for the sides.  \n     A suitable matching set (by shape/orientation as shown) is:  \n       – Block index 12,  \n       – Block index 13,  \n       – Block index 14.  \n     (These three wedges together cover the sloping pieces on the rocket.)\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nHere is one possible build sequence.  Simply follow the format “Move block with index X” in order:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1        // First red arch (left side of tower)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 1        // Second red arch (right side of tower)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 7        // Yellow rectangle across the arches\n  Step4:  Move block with index 5        // Red “circular window” block on top\n  Step5:  Move block with index 7        // Top yellow cap\n\n  Step6:  Move block with index 8        // Orange cylinder for the rocket\n  Step7:  Move block with index 12       // First orange wedge at base, left side\n  Step8:  Move block with index 13       // Second orange wedge at base, right side\n  Step9:  Move block with index 6        // First blue cube against cylinder\n  Step10: Move block with index 6        // Second blue cube against cylinder\n  Step11: Move block with index 14       // Orange wedge “roof” on top\n}\n\nFollowing those steps (and using each block only in the orientation shown by its dictionary image) re‐creates the two structures exactly as in the target scene.",

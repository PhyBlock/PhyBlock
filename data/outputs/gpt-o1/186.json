        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how to re‐create exactly what is shown in the target picture using only the unrotated blocks from the dictionary.\n\n■ 1)  OVERALL ANALYSIS OF MAIN IMAGE  \n•  There are two separate “mini‐structures.”  \n  – Left “vehicle”: 5 total pieces in 3 layers.  \n    1st layer: two horizontal orange cylinders (the “wheels”).  \n    2nd layer: one flat yellow rectangular prism bridging across the cylinders.  \n    3rd layer: a yellow half‐cylinder on top (forming the curved “roof”) and a blue cube set on one end.  \n\n  – Right “building”: 7 total pieces, effectively 3 layers.  \n    1st layer: two red arch blocks side by side (front), one tall green rectangular prism at right rear, and two tall yellow rectangular prisms at center rear (all on the “ground”).  \n    2nd layer: one vertical orange cylinder (set on the arches).  \n    3rd layer: a small orange “roof” block perched atop the cylinder.  \n\n•  In total, 12 blocks are used across both sub‐structures, arranged in up to 3 layers.\n\n■ 2)  SELECTING THE DICTIONARY BLOCKS  \nBelow are the required block indices (with quantities) that match shape, color, and orientation:\n\n– LEFT VEHICLE –  \n•  #9  (Orange horizontal cylinder) × 2  \n•  #6  (Yellow flat rectangular prism, horizontal) × 1  \n•  #10 (Yellow half‐cylinder, horizontal) × 1  \n•  #3  (Blue cube) × 1  \n\n– RIGHT BUILDING –  \n•  #1  (Red arch block, arch facing front) × 2  \n•  #5  (Green rectangular prism, vertical) × 1  \n•  #7  (Tall yellow rectangular prism, vertical) × 2  \n•  #8  (Orange cylinder, vertical) × 1  \n•  #15 (Orange “roof” piece) × 1  \n\n■ 3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER  \nUse the following move order (one block placed per step). Adjust actual positioning to match the target layout:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 9   (1st orange wheel)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 9   (2nd orange wheel)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 6   (yellow rectangular prism over wheels)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 10  (yellow half‐cylinder on top)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 3   (blue cube on one end)  \n\n  Step6:  Move block with index 1   (1st red arch, ground layer)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 1   (2nd red arch, ground layer)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 5   (green block, ground layer at right)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 7   (1st tall yellow block in rear)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 7   (2nd tall yellow block in rear)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 8   (orange cylinder on arch)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 15  (orange roof atop cylinder)\n}\n\nFollowing those steps (and placing the blocks exactly as shown in their dictionary orientations) reproduces the target scene.",

Two yellow half‐cylinders on the ground (side by side).  \n    2. One green cube directly behind the left half‐cylinder.  \n    3. One blue cube directly behind the right half‐cylinder.  \n  - **Right vehicle** (4 blocks, stacked in 3 layers):  \n    1. Two orange cylinders on the ground (side by side).  \n    2. One long yellow rectangular block resting on top of both cylinders.  \n    3. One blue cube set on top of that yellow block.\n\n• **Spatial Relationships**  \n  - Left vehicle: All four blocks share the same ground layer, with the half‐cylinders in front and the cubes behind.  \n  - Right vehicle: The two orange cylinders form the base; the yellow bar spans across them, and the blue cube sits above the bar.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\n1. **Left Vehicle**  \n   - 2 × Yellow half‐cylinder in the same orientation as in the target → **Block #12** (twice)  \n   - 1 × Green cube → **Block #2**  \n   - 1 × Blue cube → **Block #1**  \n\n2. **Right Vehicle**  \n   - 2 × Orange cylinder (horizontal orientation) → **Block #11** (twice)  \n   - 1 × Yellow rectangular bar (horizontal orientation) → **Block #6**  \n   - 1 × Blue cube → **Block #1** (again; same index reused)\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step format (one block moved per step, in a plausible bottom‐to‐top order):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 12  \n  Step2: Move block with index 12  \n  Step3: Move block with index 2  \n  Step4: Move block with index 1  \n  Step5: Move block with index 11  \n  Step6: Move block with index 11  \n  Step7: Move block with index 6  \n  Step8: Move block with index 1  \n}",

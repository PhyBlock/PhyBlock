        "content": "**1) Analysis of the Main (Target) Image**\n\nThere are actually _two_ separate structures:\n\n• **Left “Ring” Structure**  \n  – **Blocks Used**: 2 red quarter‐cylinder pieces stacked to form a circular hole in front view. You can see a horizontal seam halfway up, indicating two halves.  \n  – **Layers**: 2 layers (the bottom quarter‐cylinder and the top quarter‐cylinder).\n\n• **Right “House” Structure**  \n  – **Bottom Layer**: Two small blue cubes (left and right) and a red arch block in the center (its base also on the ground).  \n  – **Second Layer**: One long yellow rectangular block bridging across the top of the red arch and the two blue cubes.  \n  – **Top Layer**: Two red triangular wedges forming a peaked roof (a vertical ridge line is visible down the center).  \n  – **Layers**: 3 layers total.\n\nIn all, there are **8 blocks**: 2 forming the ring on the left, plus 6 forming the “house” on the right.\n\n---\n\n**2) Selection of Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\nBelow are the exact blocks (by index) and how they match the target:\n\n1. **Ring (Left Structure)**  \n   - Block #3 (red quarter‐cylinder, open‐side‐down)  \n   - Block #4 (red quarter‐cylinder, open‐side‐up)  \n\n2. **House (Right Structure)**  \n   - Block #5 (blue cube) – used twice for the left and right bottom cubes.  \n   - Block #1 (red arch) – with the arch oriented front‐to‐back (opening visible from the front).  \n   - Block #6 (yellow rectangular block) – oriented horizontally to bridge across the arch.  \n   - Block #13 and Block #14 (red triangular wedges) – placed side by side to form the peaked roof.\n\nHence, the **required indices** (including repeats) are:\n[3, 4, 5, 5, 1, 6, 13, 14].\n\n---\n\n**3) Step‐by‐Step Assembly Instructions**\n\nUse the following order (one block “move” per step):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4,  \n  Step2: Move block with index 3,  \n\n  Step3: Move block with index 5,  \n  Step4: Move block with index 5,  \n  Step5: Move block with index 1,  \n  Step6: Move block with index 6,  \n  Step7: Move block with index 13,  \n  Step8: Move block with index 14\n}\n\n- Steps 1–2 build the red “ring” on the left.  \n- Steps 3–8 build the blue‐yellow‐red “house” on the right.",

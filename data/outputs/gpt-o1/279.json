(All orientations match **exactly** as shown—no rotations different from the dictionary images.)\n\n1. **Red Arch Block (#1)** – 2 copies  \n2. **Yellow Half Cylinder (#15)** – 2 copies  \n3. **Green Tall Rectangular Prism (#9)** – 1 copy  \n4. **Yellow Tall Rectangular Prism (#12)** – 2 copies  \n5. **Orange Cylinder (lying horizontally) (#14)** – 2 copies  \n6. **Yellow Rectangular Bar (horizontal) (#11)** – 1 copy  \n7. **Blue Cube (#5)** – 1 copy  \n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step sequence (from ground up):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1  \n  Step3: Move block with index 9  \n  Step4: Move block with index 12  \n  Step5: Move block with index 12  \n  Step6: Move block with index 15  \n  Step7: Move block with index 15  \n  Step8: Move block with index 14  \n  Step9: Move block with index 14  \n  Step10: Move block with index 11  \n  Step11: Move block with index 5  \n}",

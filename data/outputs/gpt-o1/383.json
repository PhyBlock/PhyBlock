        "content": "Analysis of the Main Target Image\n--------------------------------\nThere are actually two separate “mini‐structures” in the target image:\n\n■  Left Structure (6 total blocks, effectively four vertical “layers”):\n   1) Bottom layer:\n      – One red arch block (the arch faces forward).  \n      – Two tall orange cylinders (one on each side, standing upright).  \n   2) Second layer:\n      – One green rectangular block resting on top of the red arch.  \n   3) Third layer:\n      – One blue cube centered on the green block.  \n   4) Fourth (top) layer:\n      – An orange “roof” wedge sitting on the blue cube.  \n\n■  Right Structure (6 total blocks, three main layers):\n   1) Bottom layer:\n      – Two red arch blocks side by side (arches facing forward).  \n   2) Middle layer:\n      – Two yellow rectangular blocks laid side by side to form a continuous span bridging across the arches.  \n   3) Top layer:\n      – One red arch block (again arch facing forward) placed on the yellow layer.  \n      – Immediately behind that arch, one red rectangular prism.  \n\nCounting and Layers\n-------------------\nOverall, there are 12 blocks in total:  \n• Left “castle”: 6 blocks  \n• Right “castle”: 6 blocks  \n\nSelection of Dictionary Blocks\n-----------------------------\nBelow are the required dictionary entries (by index), matching both color and orientation exactly:\n\n• Red Arch (forward‐facing) → index 2  \n• Green Rectangular Block → index 6  \n• Blue Cube → index 3  \n• Orange Roof Wedge → index 13  \n• Orange Cylinder (upright) → index 10  \n• Yellow Rectangular Beam (horizontal) → index 7  \n• Red Rectangular Prism (orientation as shown) → index 12  \n\nBecause we cannot rotate blocks, we reuse these exact indices as many times as needed. In particular:\n- We need four copies of index 2 (the red arch)  \n- Two copies of index 10 (the upright orange cylinder)  \n- Two copies of index 7 (the yellow beams)  \n\nStep-by-Step Assembly\n---------------------\nBelow is one possible build order (you can of course vary it, but here is a straightforward example):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2        // Left structure: red arch base\n  Step2: Move block with index 10       // Left structure: left orange cylinder\n  Step3: Move block with index 10       // Left structure: right orange cylinder\n  Step4: Move block with index 6        // Left structure: green block on the arch\n  Step5: Move block with index 3        // Left structure: blue cube\n  Step6: Move block with index 13       // Left structure: orange wedge roof\n\n  Step7: Move block with index 2        // Right structure: bottom-left red arch\n  Step8: Move block with index 2        // Right structure: bottom-right red arch\n  Step9: Move block with index 7        // Right structure: left yellow beam\n  Step10: Move block with index 7       // Right structure: right yellow beam\n  Step11: Move block with index 2       // Right structure: top red arch\n  Step12: Move block with index 12      // Right structure: red rectangular prism behind top arch\n}",

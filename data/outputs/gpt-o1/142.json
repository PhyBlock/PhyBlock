        "content": "1)  Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\n• Block Count & Layers  \n  – There are exactly four blocks in the structure.  \n  – They form three “stacked” layers plus the roof block on top:\n    1.  Bottom layer: one red arch‐shaped block.  \n    2.  Middle layer: one green rectangular block sitting fully atop the red arch.  \n    3.  Above that: one blue cube, placed over the left portion of the green block.  \n    4.  Roof: one orange triangular prism resting on top of the blue cube.  \n\n• Spatial Relationships  \n  – The red arch block (bottom) spans the full width of the structure at ground level.  \n  – The green rectangular block sits directly on the red arch, covering it completely in plan view.  \n  – The blue cube is centered on the left side of the green block’s top surface.  \n  – The orange triangular block is placed so it “roofs” the blue cube from front to back with its apex running front‐to‐back.  \n\n2)  Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on shape, color, and orientation (no rotations allowed), the following dictionary blocks match:\n\n• Red Arch Block → Index 1  \n• Green Horizontal Rectangular Block → Index 8  \n• Blue Cube → Index 6  \n• Orange Triangular “Roof” Block (front‐to‐back apex) → Index 11  \n\nHence, the needed indices are [1, 6, 8, 11].\n\n3)  Step‐by‐Step Assembly Order\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 8  \n  Step3: Move block with index 6  \n  Step4: Move block with index 11  \n}",

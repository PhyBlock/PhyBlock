        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can “read” the target tower and match it to the block‐dictionary images without rotating any pieces.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n•  Overall Count & Layers  \n   – The tower uses a total of 8 blocks.  \n   – They are stacked in 6 vertical “layers,” from bottom to top:  \n     1)  A single yellow rectangular slab.  \n     2)  A red “window” layer (with a circular hole in its center).  \n     3)  Another single yellow rectangular slab.  \n     4)  Two orange columns standing side by side.  \n     5)  A third yellow rectangular slab.  \n     6)  An orange triangular wedge at the top (the “roof”).  \n\n•  Spatial Arrangement (Bottom to Top)  \n   – Layer 1 (base): one horizontal yellow block.  \n   – Layer 2 (the red circular “window”): side‐by‐side pairing of two curved red blocks that combine into a square outline with a circular hole.  \n   – Layer 3: another horizontal yellow block, directly on top of the red window layer.  \n   – Layer 4: two vertical orange cylinders placed next to each other, resting on the third (yellow) slab.  \n   – Layer 5: yet another horizontal yellow block, bridging across the two columns.  \n   – Layer 6: a single orange wedge forming the “roof” at the very top.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2)  SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n•  Matching Each Visible Shape/Orientation  \n   – Yellow horizontal slabs → dictionary block #7, used three times.  \n   – Red circular “window” → one copy each of block #3 and block #4.  \n     (Together they form the square “window” piece with a circular hole through its center.)  \n   – Orange columns (vertical cylinders) → block #11, used twice.  \n   – Orange triangular roof wedge → block #16 (it appears in the correct front‐to‐back slope orientation).  \n\n•  Final List of Indices  \n   Needed indices (with repeats where required) are:  \n   •  7 (×3)  \n   •  3 (×1)  \n   •  4 (×1)  \n   •  11 (×2)  \n   •  16 (×1)  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is one logical order in which you might place these blocks (from bottom up):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7\n  Step2: Move block with index 3\n  Step3: Move block with index 4\n  Step4: Move block with index 7\n  Step5: Move block with index 11\n  Step6: Move block with index 11\n  Step7: Move block with index 7\n  Step8: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nIn practice, you would place the bottom yellow #7 first; then set #3 and #4 side by side to make the red “window”; stack the second yellow #7 on top; stand both #11 cylinders vertically; lay the third #7 slab above them; and finally cap the tower with the #16 wedge.",

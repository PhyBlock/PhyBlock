        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how to reproduce both of the pictured “arches” exactly from the dictionary blocks (without rotating any block).  I have broken the solution into the three requested parts.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Overall Count and Layers\n\n  – There are two separate arch‐like structures (left and right).  \n  – Together they use a total of 15 blocks.\n\n• Left Structure (7 blocks total)\n\n  1) Bottom layer: one yellow rectangular plank forming the base.  \n  2) Above it: two vertical orange cylinders (side by side).  \n  3) Above the cylinders: another yellow rectangular plank bridging across.  \n  4) On top of that plank: a red arch block (the half‐circle cutout facing front).  \n  5) Finally, a peaked “roof” made from two red triangular wedges.\n\n• Right Structure (8 blocks total)\n\n  1) Bottom layer: two red arch blocks side by side (arches facing front).  \n  2) Next layer: one yellow rectangular plank bridging those two arches.  \n  3) Above that plank: four red quarter‐circle blocks arranged in a ring to form the large circular opening.  \n  4) Top layer: another yellow rectangular plank laid across the top.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS AND INDICES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMatching each shape/color/orientation in the target:\n\n• Red ARCH block (#1) — used 3 times  \n  – Once for the top of the left structure  \n  – Twice at the base of the right structure\n\n• Red QUARTER‐CIRCLE block (#4) — used 4 times  \n  – Forms the circular “window” in the middle of the right‐hand structure\n\n• Yellow RECTANGULAR plank (#5) — used 4 times  \n  – Two planks in the left structure (base and top)  \n  – Two planks in the right structure (lower beam and upper beam)\n\n• Orange CYLINDER (#10) — used 2 times  \n  – The two vertical columns in the left structure\n\n• Red WEDGES (#15 and #16) — one each  \n  – They combine to form the triangular roof atop the left structure\n\nHence the needed block indices and their counts:  \n  – #1 × 3  \n  – #4 × 4  \n  – #5 × 4  \n  – #10 × 2  \n  – #15 × 1  \n  – #16 × 1  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one possible order in which to place the blocks:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 5   (left structure base plank)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 10  (first orange cylinder)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 10  (second orange cylinder)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 5   (top plank over the cylinders)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 1   (red arch on top)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 15  (first red wedge of the roof)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 16  (second red wedge of the roof)\n\n  Step8:  Move block with index 1   (left red arch of the right structure’s base)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 1   (right red arch of the right structure’s base)\n  Step10: Move block with index 5   (yellow plank bridging over those arches)\n  Step11: Move block with index 4   (first quarter‐circle for the circular window)\n  Step12: Move block with index 4   (second quarter‐circle)\n  Step13: Move block with index 4   (third quarter‐circle)\n  Step14: Move block with index 4   (fourth quarter‐circle)\n  Step15: Move block with index 5   (final yellow plank across the top)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps with the indicated blocks (exactly as they appear in the dictionary, no rotations) will yield the two structures shown in the target image.",

The above choices match color, shape, and orientation exactly as in the target image.\n\nAssembly Instructions\n\n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 9    // Bottom‐left yellow cube  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1    // Red arch block in the middle  \n  Step3: Move block with index 9    // Bottom‐right yellow cube  \n  Step4: Move block with index 15   // Left orange wedge on top of left cube  \n  Step5: Move block with index 7    // Green cube above arch (left center)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 6    // Blue cube above arch (right center)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 16   // Right orange wedge on top of right cube  \n  Step8: Move block with index 13   // Top‐layer left orange wedge  \n  Step9: Move block with index 14   // Top‐layer right orange wedge  \n}",

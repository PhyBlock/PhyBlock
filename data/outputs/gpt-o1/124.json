        "content": "Analysis of the Target Image  \nLooking closely at the finished model, it uses exactly four blocks in three “layers”:  \n•  Layer 1 (bottom): Two identical red arch‐shaped blocks set side by side. From the front, you see the half‐circle openings.  \n•  Layer 2 (middle): A single yellow rectangular block laid horizontally, bridging across the two red arches.  \n•  Layer 3 (top): One yellow half‐cylinder block resting on the center (or slightly toward one end) of the yellow rectangular block.  \n\nSelecting Blocks from the Dictionary  \n\n1)  Red Arch Blocks (two needed)  \n   – From the dictionary images, the red arch with its opening running “front‐to‐back” is block #1.  \n   – Because both base arches in the target are oriented the same way, you will use block #1 twice.  \n\n2)  Yellow Rectangular Block (one needed)  \n   – The long yellow rectangular piece, oriented lengthwise left‐to‐right, matches dictionary block #8.  \n\n3)  Yellow Half‐Cylinder (one needed)  \n   – The half‐cylindrical yellow piece with the curved top is block #11.  \n\nHence the required blocks (by index) are:  \n•  #1 (twice)  \n•  #8 (once)  \n•  #11 (once)  \n\nAssembly Order  \nBelow is a simple step‐by‐step sequence using the exact dictionary indices:\n\n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1  \n  Step3: Move block with index 8  \n  Step4: Move block with index 11  \n}",

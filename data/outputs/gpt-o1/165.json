        "content": "Below is one workable reading of the picture, together with a matching choice of blocks and a suggested build‐order.  Note that there is some ambiguity in interpreting the exact “front‐to‐back” versus “left‐to‐right” orientations of the red arches; what matters is that in the dictionary image the arch‐cut faces the same way it does in the target build.\n\n────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────\n• Overall the model separates into two sub‐structures:\n\n  A)  Left (Red/Yellow) Structure\n     – Bottom Layer: Two red arches side‐by‐side, with their arch‐cut visible from the front.  \n     – Middle Layer: Two small yellow rectangular blocks bridging across the tops of the arches.  \n     – Top Layer: Two more red arches lying across (at a right angle to those below).\n\n  B)  Right (Orange/Yellow) Tower\n     – Main Tower: Two orange cylinders stacked vertically to form a tall column.  \n     – Short Column: One more orange cylinder of the same diameter but only one cylinder high.  \n     – Mid “Platform”: Two long yellow rectangular blocks crossing each other (one left‐to‐right, the other front‐to‐back) to span between the tall and short columns.  \n     – Roof: A single orange wedge (“roof‐shaped”) atop the tall column.\n\n• In total, one can count 12 distinct blocks:\n  – 6 blocks in the red/yellow structure  \n  – 6 blocks in the tall orange/yellow tower\n\n────────────────────────────────\n2)  BLOCK‐DICTIONARY SELECTION\n────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one consistent assignment of dictionary‐block indices:\n\n A)  Left Structure (6 blocks total)\n   • Bottom arches (red), arch opening front→back:  2 × Index #2  \n   • Middle yellow planks (short horizontal rectangular):  2 × Index #4  \n   • Top arches (red), arch opening left→right:  2 × Index #1  \n\n B)  Right Tower (6 blocks total)\n   • Tall tower cylinders (orange, vertical):  2 × Index #9  \n   • Short column cylinder (orange, vertical):  1 × Index #9  \n   • Mid‐level long yellow planks (one L–R, one F–B):  1 × Index #5  and  1 × Index #7  \n   • Roof wedge (orange):  1 × Index #11\n\n(You may reuse the same index multiple times where identical pieces reappear.)\n\n──────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP SEQUENCE\n──────────────────────────\nA simple assembly order might be:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 2      // 1st bottom arch (left)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 2      // 2nd bottom arch (right)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 4      // 1st yellow plank in middle layer\n  Step4:  Move block with index 4      // 2nd yellow plank in middle layer\n  Step5:  Move block with index 1      // 1st top arch\n  Step6:  Move block with index 1      // 2nd top arch\n  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 9      // 1st cylinder (base of tall tower)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 9      // 2nd cylinder stacked for tower\n  Step9:  Move block with index 9      // Short column cylinder\n  Step10: Move block with index 5      // Long yellow plank spanning columns (L–R)\n  Step11: Move block with index 7      // Long yellow plank spanning columns (F–B)\n  Step12: Move block with index 11     // Orange wedge/roof on top\n}\n\nFollowing these assignments (and not rotating any piece differently than shown in its dictionary image) will reproduce the target arrangement.",

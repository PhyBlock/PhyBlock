A single yellow rectangular block spans all four as a platform. One additional orange cylinder stands on this platform for the neck, and a yellow half‐cylinder caps it like a head. An orange wedge block is also placed on the yellow platform (tilted).\n\n   - **Right Structure (“Bench”):**  \n     Two red arch blocks are placed side by side on the floor as the seat. On top of these arches, three green upright blocks are lined up as the bench’s backrest.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\nBelow are the dictionary indices needed (with exact color/orientation matches), and how many times each is used:\n\n- **#1 (Red Arch)** – used 2× for the bench seat (arch opening faces front).  \n- **#5 (Green Rectangular Block)** – used 3× for the bench backrest (upright orientation).  \n- **#7 (Yellow Rectangular Block)** – used 1× for the “body” of the animal.  \n- **#8 (Orange Cylinder, Upright)** – used 5× total (4 legs + 1 neck).  \n- **#10 (Yellow Half‐Cylinder)** – used 1× for the animal’s “head.”  \n- **#15 (Orange Wedge)** – used 1× for the wedge resting on the animal’s back.\n\nNo rotations other than those shown in the dictionary have been used; these blocks appear in exactly the orientations depicted.\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nA suitable step‐by‐step sequence (building from the bottom up) could be:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 8  \n  Step2: Move block with index 8  \n  Step3: Move block with index 8  \n  Step4: Move block with index 8  \n  Step5: Move block with index 7  \n  Step6: Move block with index 8  \n  Step7: Move block with index 15  \n  Step8: Move block with index 10  \n  Step9: Move block with index 1  \n  Step10: Move block with index 1  \n  Step11: Move block with index 5  \n  Step12: Move block with index 5  \n  Step13: Move block with index 5  \n}\n\n• Steps 1–8 assemble the “animal” (four orange legs, yellow body block, orange neck cylinder, orange wedge, and yellow half‐cylinder).  \n• Steps 9–13 assemble the bench (two red arches for the seat, then three green upright blocks for the backrest).",

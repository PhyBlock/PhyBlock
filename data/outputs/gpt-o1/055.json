(Need 2)  \n   - **Red Cubes:** Index 3. (Need 2)  \n   - **Tall Green Pillars (vertical orientation):** Index 8. (Need 2)  \n   - **Yellow Horizontal Beams:** Index 16. (Need 3)\n\n3. **Assembly Order**  \n\nUse the following step‑by‑step sequence (indices refer to the dictionary):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 16  (place the bottom yellow beam)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 8   (place first tall green pillar)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 8   (place second tall green pillar)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 3   (place first red cube)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 3   (place second red cube)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 16  (place the middle yellow beam)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 1   (place first blue cube)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 1   (place second blue cube)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 16  (place the top yellow beam)  \n}",

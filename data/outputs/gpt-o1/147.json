        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how to reproduce the tower exactly as shown, using only the orientations provided in the “Block Dictionary” image.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DESCRIPTION OF THE TARGET (MAIN) IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  Total Block Count and Layers\n   – There are 10 total pieces.  \n   – From bottom to top, you can think of the structure in roughly three “levels”:  \n       1.  Three orange cylinders on the ground (two at the front, one at the back), plus a second orange cylinder stacked on top of the rear cylinder.  \n       2.  A large yellow rectangular “platform” resting across the two front cylinders, with a “mini‐house” on top (red arch plus two yellow half‐cylinders).  \n       3.  Two orange wedge “roofs”: one crowning the tall rear cylinder tower, and one atop the red arch.  \n\n•  Spatial Arrangement\n   – The front “legs” are two vertical orange cylinders, side by side.  \n   – A single thick yellow rectangular block spans across these two front cylinders to form a floor or platform.  \n   – Behind this platform is a tall orange “tower” made by stacking two vertical orange cylinders.  \n   – On top of the yellow platform sits a small “house” composed of:  \n       • A red arch block standing upright (arch opening downward).  \n       • A yellow half‐cylinder nestled under that arch.  \n       • A second yellow half‐cylinder directly behind the arch (creating a domed shape at the rear).  \n       • A small orange wedge roof placed on top of that red arch.  \n   – Finally, another orange wedge block sits on the very top of the tall orange cylinder tower.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING / LISTING THE REQUIRED DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMatching the colors and orientations exactly as shown (no rotations allowed beyond what the dictionary provides), the following blocks are used (with repeats where needed):\n\n• Block #8 (Orange Cylinder, vertical) → used 4 times  \n  – Two form the front legs  \n  – Two stacked to form the tall rear tower  \n\n• Block #4 (Yellow Rectangular Block, horizontal) → used once  \n  – Forms the large yellow platform spanning the front cylinders  \n\n• Block #1 (Red Arch Block, arch opening downward) → used once  \n  – Forms the red “house” arch  \n\n• Block #10 (Yellow Half‐Cylinder) → used twice  \n  – One half‐cylinder under the red arch  \n  – One half‐cylinder at the rear of the arch  \n\n• Block #16 (Orange Wedge/Roof, apex centered) → used twice  \n  – One on top of the tall orange tower  \n  – One on top of the red arch “house”\n\nIn short:\n – #8 × 4  \n – #4 × 1  \n – #1 × 1  \n – #10 × 2  \n – #16 × 2  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n{  \n   Step1: Move block with index 8   (place first orange cylinder at front left)  \n   Step2: Move block with index 8   (place second orange cylinder at front right)  \n   Step3: Move block with index 8   (place third orange cylinder at rear, forming tower base)  \n   Step4: Move block with index 4   (lay the yellow rectangular platform across the two front cylinders)  \n   Step5: Move block with index 8   (stack fourth orange cylinder atop the rear cylinder to extend the tower)  \n   Step6: Move block with index 10  (place first yellow half‐cylinder under where the red arch will go)  \n   Step7: Move block with index 10  (place second yellow half‐cylinder behind the arch location)  \n   Step8: Move block with index 1   (set the red arch block over the half‐cylinders)  \n   Step9: Move block with index 16  (place an orange wedge/roof on top of the red arch)  \n   Step10: Move block with index 16 (set the second orange wedge/roof on top of the tall cylinder tower)  \n}\n\nFollowing the above sequence will reproduce the tower exactly as seen in the target image.",

This matches **block index 1** most closely.  \n- **Orange Cylinders**: The two cylinders lie horizontally side by side. In the dictionary, indices 7 is a vertical cylinder, while 8 and 9 are horizontal but from mirrored viewpoints. One cylinder matches **index 8** and the other matches **index 9** so that, placed side by side, they replicate the orientation seen in the main image.\n\nHence, the blocks needed (with exact orientations as shown) are:\n• Two orange cylinders: indices **8** and **9**  \n• One yellow rectangular block: index **1**\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step sequence:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 8,\n  Step2: Move block with index 9,\n  Step3: Move block with index 1\n}",

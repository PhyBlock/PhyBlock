        "content": "Below is a worked‐through solution illustrating how the scene is composed and which dictionary blocks (with their given orientations) are used. It is broken down into (1) a descriptive analysis of the two structures, (2) a list of required blocks (by index) matching the exact orientations shown, and (3) a suggested assembly order.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n● Overall Count and Layers\n  – There are two separate structures.  \n  – In total, the scene uses 13 blocks.  \n\n● Tall Tower (8 Blocks)\n  Layer‐by‐layer from bottom to top:\n   1) A horizontal yellow rectangular block as the base.  \n   2) Two tall green rectangular blocks standing upright, side by side.  \n   3) A horizontal yellow rectangular block bridging across the tops of the two green blocks.  \n   4) Two orange cylinders standing upright on top of that middle yellow block.  \n   5) Another horizontal yellow rectangular block capping the two orange cylinders.  \n   6) A single orange triangular wedge (or “roof” piece) resting on top.\n\n● House‐Shaped Structure (5 Blocks)\n  – Bottom layer: One red cube and one yellow cube side by side.  \n  – Middle “band”: A green rectangular block oriented horizontally, spanning the width of the two cubes below.  \n  – Roof layer: Two orange triangular wedges, arranged so that they form a pitched roof.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) SELECTION OF REQUIRED BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA) Tall Tower (8 Blocks):\n   • (3) × Block #8  (Yellow rectangular block, horizontal orientation)  \n   • (2) × Block #6  (Green rectangular block, vertical orientation)  \n   • (2) × Block #9  (Orange cylinder, vertical orientation)  \n   • (1) × Block #15 (Orange wedge in the matching “roof” orientation)\n\nB) House‐Shaped Structure (5 Blocks):\n   • (1) × Block #3  (Red cube)  \n   • (1) × Block #4  (Yellow cube)  \n   • (1) × Block #5  (Green rectangular block, horizontal orientation)  \n   • (1) × Block #13 (Orange wedge, left‐roof orientation)  \n   • (1) × Block #14 (Orange wedge, right‐roof orientation)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) RECOMMENDED STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 8   (place 1st yellow horizontal block for tower base)\n  Step2: Move block with index 6   (place 1st green vertical block on the base)\n  Step3: Move block with index 6   (place 2nd green vertical block on the base)\n  Step4: Move block with index 8   (bridge the green blocks with yellow horizontal)\n  Step5: Move block with index 9   (place 1st orange cylinder on top)\n  Step6: Move block with index 9   (place 2nd orange cylinder on top)\n  Step7: Move block with index 8   (bridge the two cylinders with yellow horizontal)\n  Step8: Move block with index 15  (add the orange wedge as the tower’s roof)\n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 3  (place red cube for the house base)\n  Step10: Move block with index 4  (place yellow cube for the house base)\n  Step11: Move block with index 5  (place green horizontal block atop those cubes)\n  Step12: Move block with index 13 (place left orange wedge for the roof)\n  Step13: Move block with index 14 (place right orange wedge for the roof)\n}\n\nUse the listed block indices exactly as given (no additional rotations) to reproduce the target arrangement.",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n1. **Number of Blocks and Layers**  \n   - The scene is composed of two separate “mini‐structures.” The left structure is a tall “tower” with two short vertical cylinders as “legs,” a rectangular platform spanning those legs, a red arch block on the platform, a yellow half‐cylinder on top of the arch, and two more vertical cylinders stacked behind forming the tall column, topped by an orange wedge.  \n   - The right structure looks like a “cart,” with two horizontally oriented orange cylinders acting as wheels, a yellow rectangular block bridging those wheels, a blue cube on top of one end of the block, and a yellow half‐cylinder on the other end.\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure)**  \n   - Bottom layer: Two short orange cylinders stand vertically side by side (the “legs”) plus another stack of two orange cylinders behind them (the “tower”).  \n   - Second layer: A horizontal yellow rectangular block (“platform”) rests on top of the two front cylinders and is also adjacent to the bottom cylinder of the tower.  \n   - Third layer: A red arch block sits on top of the yellow platform. A yellow half‐cylinder rests on the arch’s flat upper face.  \n   - The top of the tower: Two short orange cylinders are stacked vertically, with an orange wedge (small “roof”) capping the topmost cylinder.\n\n3. **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure)**  \n   - Bottom layer: Two short orange cylinders laid horizontally, parallel to each other (the “wheels”).  \n   - Second layer: A horizontal yellow rectangular block bridging on top of these two wheels.  \n   - Third layer: A blue cube sits on one side of that yellow block; a yellow half‐cylinder is placed on the other side.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nBelow are the dictionary indices (in parentheses) and how many times each is used:\n\n- **Orange short cylinder (vertical) – #7**: 4×  \n  (2 for the front legs of the tower and 2 stacked to form the tall column behind)  \n- **Orange cylinder (horizontal) – #9**: 2×  \n  (the two “wheels” of the right‐hand structure)  \n- **Orange wedge (roof shape) – #16**: 1×  \n  (the small orange “roof” on top of the tall tower)  \n- **Yellow rectangular block (horizontal) – #5**: 2×  \n  (one bridging the two front legs on the left tower and one bridging the two horizontal wheels on the right)  \n- **Yellow half‐cylinder (horizontal) – #10**: 2×  \n  (one on top of the red arch, one on the “cart” next to the blue cube)  \n- **Red arch block – #1**: 1×  \n  (sits under the yellow half‐cylinder in the left structure)  \n- **Blue cube – #4**: 1×  \n  (the blue block on the right‐hand structure)\n\n---\n\n**Step‐by‐Step Assembly Order**\n\nUse the blocks exactly as listed below (note that the same index may appear multiple times). A convenient build sequence would be:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7   (left front leg)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 7   (left right leg)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 5   (yellow platform spanning the two legs)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 7   (base of the tall tower behind)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 7   (second tower cylinder stacked above)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 16  (orange wedge “roof” on top of the tower)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 1   (red arch on top of the yellow platform)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 10  (yellow half‐cylinder on the red arch)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 9   (first horizontal “wheel” of the cart)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 9  (second horizontal “wheel” of the cart)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 5  (yellow block bridging the two wheels)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 4  (blue cube on one end of the cart)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 10 (yellow half‐cylinder on the other end)\n}\n\nThis completes the structure shown in the main target image without rotating any blocks beyond their dictionary orientations.",

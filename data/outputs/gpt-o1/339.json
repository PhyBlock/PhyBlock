        "content": "Below is a concise “walk‐through” of how the pictured scene is built and which dictionary blocks are used.  The description is divided into two main groups (the “house‐and‐tower” on the left, and the “vehicle” on the right).\n\n─────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n─────────\n•  Total Blocks and Layers\n   –  There are 11 total blocks forming two separate structures:  \n     •  A small “house” with an arched base, plus a cylindrical “tower” to its right  \n     •  A “vehicle” consisting of a long rectangular body, two cylindrical wheels, a cube, and a half‐cylinder  \n   –  The “house” portion has three vertical layers (red arch at bottom, green rectangular block in the middle, blue cube at the top) capped by an orange roof block.  The tower is a single orange cylinder topped by another orange roof block.  The vehicle is one layer of two orange cylinders (wheels) supporting a long yellow rectangular block, with a blue cube and a yellow half‐cylinder on top.\n\n•  Spatial Relationships (Left Group)\n   –  Bottom of the house: Red arch block  \n   –  Directly on top: Green rectangular block  \n   –  Above that: Blue cube  \n   –  Capping it: Orange triangular “roof” piece  \n   –  Tower (to the right of the house): One vertical orange cylinder topped by a second orange triangular roof  \n\n•  Spatial Relationships (Right Group / Vehicle)\n   –  Bottom layer: Two horizontal orange cylinders (the “wheels”)  \n   –  Next: A long yellow rectangular block spanning across those wheels  \n   –  On top, toward one end: A blue cube  \n   –  On top, toward the other end: A yellow half‐cylinder (curved side facing upward)\n\n────────────\n2)  SELECTING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────\n\nHouse+Tower (6 blocks total)\n•  Red arch at bottom of house → Dictionary index 1  \n•  Green rectangular block above arch → Dictionary index 6  \n•  Blue cube above green block → Dictionary index 4  \n•  Orange roof on top of the cube → Dictionary index 15  \n•  Orange cylinder for tower → Dictionary index 9 (vertical orientation)  \n•  Orange roof on top of tower → Dictionary index 14  \n\nVehicle (5 blocks total)\n•  2 × Orange horizontal cylinders (the wheels) → Dictionary index 10 (use it twice)  \n•  Long yellow rectangular block (main body) → Dictionary index 8  \n•  Blue cube (sits on the rear portion) → Dictionary index 4 (used again)  \n•  Yellow half‐cylinder on top (front portion) → Dictionary index 11  \n\nHence the exact list of indices (and how many times each is needed):  \n1, 6, 4, 15, 9, 14, 10, 10, 8, 4, 11  \n\nAll orientations must match exactly as shown in the dictionary images (no rotations beyond what is pictured there).\n\n────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY\n────────────\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1    // red arch, forms house base\n  Step2: Move block with index 6    // green rectangular block above arch\n  Step3: Move block with index 4    // blue cube on top of green block\n  Step4: Move block with index 15   // orange triangular roof for the house\n  Step5: Move block with index 9    // orange cylinder for the tower\n  Step6: Move block with index 14   // orange roof on tower\n  Step7: Move block with index 10   // first horizontal cylinder (wheel)\n  Step8: Move block with index 10   // second horizontal cylinder (wheel)\n  Step9: Move block with index 8    // yellow rectangular body spanning the wheels\n  Step10: Move block with index 4   // blue cube on the vehicle’s body\n  Step11: Move block with index 11  // yellow half‐cylinder on the front portion\n}\n\nThat completes the assembly in the same layout and orientations seen in the target image.",

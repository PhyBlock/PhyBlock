        "content": "Below is one way to “read off” the two structures from the images and match them (without rotations) to the dictionary blocks:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  There are TWO separate assemblies:\n\n  A) The Red “Ring” on the Left  \n     – Composed of two red half‐cylinders stacked to form a circular hole.\n     – Visually, you can see a horizontal seam halfway up, meaning the top and bottom halves are each a “C”‐shaped red block.\n\n  B) The “House” on the Right  \n     – Built in four vertical layers (bottom to top).  \n     – From the coloring and shape, a likely breakdown is:  \n       • Layer 1 (bottom): Three green cubes side by side.  \n       • Layer 2: Three orange cubes side by side (directly on top of the green row).  \n       • Layer 3: Blue–Yellow–Blue cubes side by side, forming the top “walls” with a yellow center “window.”  \n       • Layer 4 (roof): Two orange triangular blocks meeting in the middle to form a peaked roof.\n\n•  Overall Block Count:\n  – Ring = 2 blocks  \n  – House = 11 blocks (3 green + 3 orange + 2 blue + 1 yellow + 2 orange triangles)  \n  – Total = 13 blocks\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING MATCHING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA) Red Ring (2 blocks)  \n   – Requires two red “C”‐shaped halves, oriented exactly as shown so that when stacked they form a circular hole.  \n   – From the dictionary, #3 and #4 are the two complementary halves (one open to the left, the other open to the right).  \n     • Bottom half: #3  \n     • Top half:   #4  \n\nB) House (11 blocks)\n   1. Green Cubes (3×)  \n      – Use green‐cube #6 three times (all cubes are identical aside from orientation; #6 is already upright).  \n   2. Orange Cubes (3×)  \n      – Use orange‐cube #7 three times for the second‐layer “walls.”  \n   3. Blue Cubes (2×)  \n      – Use blue‐cube #5 twice for the left‐ and right‐side cubes in the third layer.  \n   4. Yellow Cube (1×)  \n      – Use yellow‐cube #9 in the center of the third layer.  \n   5. Orange Triangular Roof (2×)  \n      – Use #15 and #16, which are orange wedge blocks oriented so that they form a symmetrical peak when placed side by side.\n\nHence the exact block indices needed are:\n• #3, #4 (red halves for the ring)  \n• #5 (blue cubes) – used twice  \n• #6 (green cubes) – used three times  \n• #7 (orange cubes) – used three times  \n• #9 (yellow cube) – used once  \n• #15, #16 (roof wedges) – used once each  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA possible build sequence (placing the ring first, then the house from bottom to top) is:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 3        // Bottom half of red ring\n  Step2:  Move block with index 4        // Top half of red ring\n\n  Step3:  Move block with index 6        // Bottom row of house (first green)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 6        // Bottom row of house (second green)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 6        // Bottom row of house (third green)\n\n  Step6:  Move block with index 7        // Second layer of house (first orange)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 7        // Second layer of house (second orange)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 7        // Second layer of house (third orange)\n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 5        // Third layer left (blue)\n  Step10: Move block with index 9        // Third layer center (yellow)\n  Step11: Move block with index 5        // Third layer right (blue)\n\n  Step12: Move block with index 15       // Roof left\n  Step13: Move block with index 16       // Roof right\n}\n\nThat completes both the red ring on the left and the multi‐layered “house” on the right, exactly matching the target image using the blocks as‐is from the dictionary.",

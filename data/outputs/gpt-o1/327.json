        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can identify and assemble exactly the blocks shown in the target image, using only the orientations given in the dictionary (no rotations beyond what is shown there).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN (TARGET) STRUCTURE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•  Overall there are two separate “mini‐structures.”  \n•  LEFT‐HAND BUILD:\n   –  Total of 8 blocks.  \n   –  Bottom/First Layer:  \n      1) Three tall green pillars (two on the sides, one in the back center).  \n      2) One vertical orange cylinder in front center.  \n      3) Two orange triangular wedges leaning outward on the left and right edges.  \n   –  Second Layer:  \n      4) One horizontal green rectangular block bridging across the tops of the three pillars.  \n   –  Third (Roof) Layer:  \n      5) One orange triangular wedge perched on top (the “roof”).  \n\n•  RIGHT‐HAND BUILD:\n   –  Total of 5 blocks.  \n   –  Bottom/First Layer:\n      1) One flat green rectangular block lying horizontally on the ground.  \n   –  Second Layer:\n      2) One vertical orange cylinder stacked on that green base.  \n   –  Third Layer:\n      3) One horizontal green rectangular block on top of the cylinder.  \n      4) Two tall green pillars standing on that horizontal block, forming a “U” shape from above.  \n\nIn total, the entire scene uses 13 blocks arranged in three “layers” in each sub‐structure.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2)  SELECTING THE BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom the dictionary image (indices 1–16), the following exact‐orientation pieces are required.  \nParentheses show how many times each is used.\n\n•  Green Rectangular Blocks:  \n   –  #1 (Horizontal orientation): used 3 times  \n   –  #2 (Vertical, wide face forward): used 1 time  \n   –  #3 (Vertical, narrow face forward): used 4 times  \n\n•  Orange Cylinders:  \n   –  #6 (Vertical cylinder): used 2 times  \n\n•  Orange Triangular Wedges:  \n   –  #9  (Roof‐style wedge, apex up): used 1 time  \n   –  #13 (Apex to the left): used 1 time  \n   –  #14 (Apex to the right): used 1 time  \n\nIn total, that gives 13 blocks in exactly the orientations shown in the dictionary.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is one possible order for placing the 13 blocks (you may of course rearrange the order so long as the bottom‐most pieces are placed first):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 3   (Left vertical pillar on the left structure)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 2   (Center‐rear vertical pillar on the left structure)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 3   (Right vertical pillar on the left structure)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 13  (Left orange wedge at base)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 6   (Vertical orange cylinder in front center)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 14  (Right orange wedge at base)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 1   (Horizontal green block bridging pillars)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 9   (Orange “roof” wedge on top)\n\n  -- Now the right‐hand build --\n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 1   (Flat green base on the ground)\n  Step10: Move block with index 6   (Vertical orange cylinder)\n  Step11: Move block with index 1   (Horizontal green block on top of cylinder)\n  Step12: Move block with index 3   (Left vertical pillar on top)\n  Step13: Move block with index 3   (Right vertical pillar on top)\n}\n\nFollowing the above placements (without re‐orienting blocks beyond what is shown in the dictionary images) yields the target scene exactly as shown.",

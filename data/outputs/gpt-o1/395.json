Stacking two of these in the shown orientation creates the circular hole on the tower.  \n   - Needed twice.\n\n3. **Green pillars** (the tower’s vertical columns):  \n   - Index **5** is the long green rectangular prism standing upright.  \n   - Needed twice.\n\n4. **Yellow rectangular “plates”**  \n   - Index **7** is the horizontally oriented rectangular yellow block. All the flat yellow “plates” in both structures match this orientation.  \n   - Needed four times: three for the tower (bottom, middle, top) and one for the smaller arch structure.\n\n5. **Yellow half‐cylinder** (the curved cap on the smaller structure):  \n   - Index **10** is the yellow half‐cylinder lying horizontally.  \n   - Needed once.\n\n6. **Orange triangular roof block**  \n   - Index **16** is the orange wedge oriented as in the tower’s rooftop.  \n   - Needed once.\n\n**Block‐Index List**  \n• Red arch (#1) × 2  \n• Red half‐circle cut (#4) × 2  \n• Green vertical pillar (#5) × 2  \n• Yellow rectangular plate (#7) × 4  \n• Yellow half‐cylinder (#10) × 1  \n• Orange triangular wedge (#16) × 1  \n\n---\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nA straightforward way is to build the tower first from bottom to top, then assemble the smaller arch structure:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7   (tower bottom yellow plate)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 4   (lower red half‐circle)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 4   (upper red half‐circle)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 7   (middle yellow plate)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 5   (left green pillar)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 5   (right green pillar)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 7   (top yellow plate)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 16  (orange triangular roof)  \n\n  Step9: Move block with index 1   (left red arch for small structure)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 1  (right red arch)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 7  (yellow bridging plate)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 10 (yellow half‐cylinder on top)\n}",

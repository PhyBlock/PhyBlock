Use the blocks in the exact orientations shown in the dictionary (no rotations):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 13     // Left column bottom\n  Step2: Move block with index 6      // Left column lower red half\n  Step3: Move block with index 5      // Left column upper red half\n  Step4: Move block with index 13     // Left column top\n\n  Step5: Move block with index 13     // Right column bottom\n  Step6: Move block with index 11     // Right column left green pillar\n  Step7: Move block with index 11     // Right column right green pillar\n  Step8: Move block with index 7      // Right column center-bottom blue block\n  Step9: Move block with index 8      // Right column center-top red block\n  Step10: Move block with index 13    // Right column top\n}",

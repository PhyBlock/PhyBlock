Bottom layer of three red arches (forming a “bench”) plus four orange cylinders (the “legs”).  \n    2. Second layer of four green rectangular blocks on top of the red arches, and two yellow rectangular blocks forming a “tabletop” on the orange cylinders.  \n    3. Third layer consisting of one tall orange cylinder standing on the tabletop, capped by one yellow half‐cylinder.\n\n• **Spatial Relationships**  \n  – Three red arch‐shaped blocks line up side‐by‐side.  \n  – Four small green rectangular blocks sit in a row on top of these arches.  \n  – Behind the arches are four orange cylinders arranged in a rectangle; the two yellow rectangular blocks sit on top of those cylinders.  \n  – A fifth orange cylinder rises from the left side of the tabletop; the yellow half‐cylinder rests on top of that tall cylinder.\n\n---\n\n**2) Selecting Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\nBelow are the exact matches (no rotation allowed beyond what is shown):\n\n• **Red arches (3 needed):** Block #1  \n• **Green rectangular blocks (4 needed):** Block #4  \n• **Yellow rectangular “tabletop” blocks (2 needed):** Block #9  \n• **Orange vertical cylinders (5 needed):** Block #12  \n• **Yellow half‐cylinder “cap” (1 needed):** Block #14  \n\nHence the block indices required (with repeats) are:  \n1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 14  \n\n---\n\n**3) Step‐by‐Step Assembly Instructions**\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1  \n  Step3: Move block with index 1  \n  Step4: Move block with index 4  \n  Step5: Move block with index 4  \n  Step6: Move block with index 4  \n  Step7: Move block with index 4  \n  Step8: Move block with index 12  \n  Step9: Move block with index 12  \n  Step10: Move block with index 12  \n  Step11: Move block with index 12  \n  Step12: Move block with index 9  \n  Step13: Move block with index 9  \n  Step14: Move block with index 12  \n  Step15: Move block with index 14  \n}",

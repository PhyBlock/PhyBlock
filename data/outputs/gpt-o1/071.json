        "content": "Below is one workable “layer‐by‐layer” breakdown of the tower, followed by which dictionary‐blocks (by index) match each piece and a possible build order.  The key points are:\n\n• There are seven “levels” (horizontal layers) in the finished tower.  \n• Red arches form the bottom two levels, three bands of yellow blocks form “rings” at levels 2, 4, and 6, two tall green pillars plus one shorter green block make the fifth level, and an orange triangular block is the topmost piece.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  LAYER‐BY‐LAYER DESCRIPTION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Layer 1 (bottom):\n  – Two red arch blocks side by side (arches facing front).\n  \n• Layer 2:\n  – A “ring” of four short yellow blocks (front, back, left, right), each laid so that together they bridge across the red arches and enclose the center.\n\n• Layer 3:\n  – Two more red arch blocks (again facing front) forming a second “arched” level above layer 2.\n\n• Layer 4:\n  – Another “ring” of four short yellow blocks, arranged the same way as layer 2.\n\n• Layer 5:\n  – Three green blocks: two tall green pillars standing vertically (left and right) plus one short green block laid horizontally between them at the front (so that from the front view it looks like one slender pillar in the middle and one on each side, but it is actually two tall pillars and a short horizontal piece).\n\n• Layer 6:\n  – A third “ring” of four short yellow blocks on top of the green layer.\n\n• Layer 7 (top):\n  – One orange triangular “roof” block, centered above the yellow ring.\n\nOverall Block‐Counts (as seen in the final tower):\n • Red Arches: 4 total  \n • Short Yellow Rectangles: 12 total (4 × 3 rings)  \n • Tall Green Rectangles: 2 total  \n • Short Green Rectangle: 1 total  \n • Orange Triangular Block: 1 total  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING BLOCK‐INDEX NUMBERS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is a mapping from each visible shape/color/orientation in the tower to one of the numbered blocks in the “Block Dictionary” image.  This mapping ensures *no extra rotation* of a dictionary piece is required.\n\n• Red Arches (front‐facing arch):\n  – Use block #1.  \n  – Needed 4 times (two for the bottom layer, two for the third layer).\n\n• Short Yellow Rectangles\n  – For front/back pieces (length left‐to‐right), use block #8.  \n  – For left/right pieces (length front‐to‐back), use block #9.  \n  – Each “ring” of 4 yellow blocks is therefore 2 × #8 + 2 × #9.  \n  – There are 3 such rings → total of 6 × #8 and 6 × #9.\n\n• Tall Green Rectangles (vertical pillars):\n  – Use block #6.  \n  – Needed 2 times.\n\n• Short Green Rectangle (horizontal piece between pillars):\n  – Use block #5.  \n  – Needed 1 time.\n\n• Orange Triangular “Roof”:\n  – Use block #14.  \n  – Needed 1 time.\n\nSummarizing the dictionary‐block usage:\n\n  Red (#1) → 4 copies  \n  Yellow (#8) → 6 copies  \n  Yellow (#9) → 6 copies  \n  Green (#6) → 2 copies  \n  Green (#5) → 1 copy  \n  Orange (#14) → 1 copy  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA simple bottom‐to‐top build sequence (one “move block” step per piece) could be:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1   (red arch, bottom layer)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 1   (red arch, bottom layer)\n  \n  -- Now place the first yellow “ring” (layer 2: front/back = #8, sides = #9) --\n  Step3:  Move block with index 8\n  Step4:  Move block with index 8\n  Step5:  Move block with index 9\n  Step6:  Move block with index 9\n  \n  -- Next the second set of red arches (layer 3) --\n  Step7:  Move block with index 1\n  Step8:  Move block with index 1\n  \n  -- Second yellow ring (layer 4) --\n  Step9:  Move block with index 8\n  Step10: Move block with index 8\n  Step11: Move block with index 9\n  Step12: Move block with index 9\n  \n  -- Green pillars + short green piece (layer 5) --\n  Step13: Move block with index 6   (tall green pillar)\n  Step14: Move block with index 6   (tall green pillar)\n  Step15: Move block with index 5   (short green, bridges pillars)\n  \n  -- Third yellow ring (layer 6) --\n  Step16: Move block with index 8\n  Step17: Move block with index 8\n  Step18: Move block with index 9\n  Step19: Move block with index 9\n  \n  -- Finally, the orange roof (layer 7) --\n  Step20: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThat sequence yields the exact tower shown in the target image, using only the dictionary blocks in the orientations provided (no extra rotations).",

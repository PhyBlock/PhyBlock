A single green rectangular block lying flat at the bottom.  \n    2. One orange cylinder standing upright on top of the green base.  \n    3. The “ring” and wedge on top of the cylinder. This ring is made of  \n       – Two vertical green rectangular blocks (left and right).  \n       – Two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks (top and bottom).  \n       – A single orange triangular wedge in the center.  \n\n• Spatial Relationships  \n  – Bottom Layer: A green rectangular prism sits flat on the ground.  \n  – Middle Layer: An upright orange cylinder is centered atop the green base.  \n  – Top Layer (the ring): Two upright green blocks form the left and right sides; two yellow horizontal blocks form the top and bottom edges. An orange wedge is set within the ring, oriented so that its triangular face is visible from the front.  \n\nSelection of Dictionary Blocks\n\nTo match each color, shape, and orientation exactly (without rotating any blocks beyond what is shown), the following dictionary blocks suffice:\n\n1) Green, short horizontal rectangular base → index 1  \n2) Orange, vertical cylinder → index 10  \n3) Green, tall vertical rectangular columns (need two of the same) → index 4 (used twice)  \n4) Yellow, short horizontal rectangular beams (need two of the same) → index 7 (used twice)  \n5) Orange, triangular wedge in the correct “forward‐facing” orientation → index 15  \n\nAssembly Order\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 10\n  Step3: Move block with index 7\n  Step4: Move block with index 4\n  Step5: Move block with index 4\n  Step6: Move block with index 7\n  Step7: Move block with index 15\n}",

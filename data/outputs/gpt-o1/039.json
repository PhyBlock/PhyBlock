They stack in essentially one “layer” (no vertical stacking on top of each other).\n\n• **Spatial Relationships**  \n  1. The two red halves align front‐to‐back, creating a single rectangular red body with a circular hole running from the front face through to the back.  \n  2. A single green bar passes horizontally (left to right) through the center of that circular opening.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting Required Blocks**\n\nFrom the dictionary image, the best matches (without reorienting any piece) are:\n\n- **Red front half:** Block index **5** (shows the half‐cylinder opening facing forward).  \n- **Red rear half:** Block index **8** (same shape but half‐cylinder opening facing backward).  \n- **Green horizontal bar:** Block index **9** (short green rectangular prism oriented left‐to‐right).  \n\nNo other orientations are needed, and each block is used exactly once.\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nThe recommended step‐by‐step sequence is:\n\n{\n Step1: Move block with index 5  \n Step2: Move block with index 9  \n Step3: Move block with index 8  \n}",

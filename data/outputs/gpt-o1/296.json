Note that orientation must match exactly as shown—no re‐orientations allowed.\n\n• **#10** (Orange cylinder), used 2× for the vehicle “wheels.”  \n• **#6** (Green rectangular prism, short), used 3× total:  \n  – 1× bridging the wheels on the left vehicle,  \n  – 2× behind the left and right arches on the right structure.  \n• **#5** (Red rectangular prism), used 2× total:  \n  – 1× stacked under the blue cube of the left vehicle,  \n  – 1× on top of the right arch (forming the “house” body).  \n• **#3** (Blue cube), used 2× total:  \n  – 1× at the top of the left vehicle,  \n  – 1× on top of the left arch in the right structure.  \n• **#1** (Red arch, front‐opening), used 3× along the base of the right structure.  \n• **#7** (Green rectangular prism, tall), used 1× behind the middle arch on the right structure.  \n• **#9** (Yellow rectangular prism, tall), used 2× behind the middle arch (the two tall yellow columns).  \n• **#11** (Yellow half‐cylinder), used 2× atop the middle arch.  \n• **#16** (Orange wedge), used 2× total:  \n  – 1× as a roof over the blue cube (left arch “house”),  \n  – 1× as a roof over the red block (right arch “house”).\n\n**Step-by-Step Assembly Instructions**\n\nUse the following step order (you may of course combine steps in practice, but here each is listed separately):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 10  --(Place first orange cylinder wheel)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 10  --(Place second orange cylinder wheel)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 6   --(Bridge the wheels with a green rectangular block)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 5   --(Stack the red block on top of the green)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 3   --(Place the blue cube on top of the red block)  \n\n  Step6: Move block with index 1   --(Place first red arch for right structure)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 1   --(Place second red arch)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 1   --(Place third red arch)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 3   --(Put a blue cube on top of the left arch)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 5  --(Put a red rectangular block on top of the right arch)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 11 --(First yellow half‐cylinder, atop middle arch)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 11 --(Second yellow half‐cylinder, next to the first)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 6  --(Green rectangular prism behind left arch)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 7  --(Tall green block behind middle arch)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 6  --(Green rectangular prism behind right arch)  \n  Step16: Move block with index 9  --(First tall yellow block behind middle arch)  \n  Step17: Move block with index 9  --(Second tall yellow block behind middle arch)  \n  Step18: Move block with index 16 --(Orange wedge roof above blue cube)  \n  Step19: Move block with index 16 --(Orange wedge roof above red block)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps (without any re‐orientation of blocks beyond what is shown in the dictionary) replicates the target image exactly.",

        "content": "Below is one workable interpretation of how to reproduce the two structures exactly from the provided dictionary blocks (without rotating any block differently from how it appears in the dictionary).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)  DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN (TARGET) IMAGE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are two separate assemblies:\n\n• TALL “TOWER” (Left Side)\n  – It has three horizontal “bridge” pieces in bright‐yellow (one at the very bottom, one in the middle, and one at the top).  \n  – On the left side, a single tall green pillar runs from bottom to top.  \n  – On the right side, three small cubes (red on the bottom, blue in the middle, red on the top) are stacked in a vertical column.  \n\nHence, the tower can be viewed as 7 total blocks:\n  (a) 3 long yellow rectangles (the horizontal bridges)  \n  (b) 1 tall green rectangular block (the pillar)  \n  (c) 3 small cubes (red/blue/red) making the right column.  \n\n• “HOUSE‐LIKE” STRUCTURE (Right Side)\n  – A red arch at the bottom forms the “doorway.”  \n  – Directly above that are two small red cubes side by side (filling out a red rectangular layer).  \n  – On top of the red cubes sit two yellow half‐cylinders (placed side by side).  \n  – Finally, an orange wedge forms the triangular “roof.”  \n\nThis second structure uses 6 total blocks:\n  (a) 1 red arch block  \n  (b) 2 small red cubes  \n  (c) 2 yellow half‐cylinders  \n  (d) 1 orange wedge.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2)  MATCHING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is exactly which dictionary blocks correspond to each piece (and how many of each are used).  \nRemember you must not rotate any block differently from its shown orientation:\n\n● For the TALL TOWER\n\n  – Tall green pillar (left column):  1 × Block #7  \n    (#7 is the upright green rectangle with its narrow face forward, matching the tower’s vertical orientation.)  \n\n  – Right‐side cubes (stacked red/blue/red):\n      Bottom red cube:  1 × Block #5  \n      Middle blue cube: 1 × Block #3  \n      Top red cube:     1 × Block #5  \n\n  – Horizontal yellow bridges:  3 × Block #9  \n    (#9 is the yellow rectangular prism oriented lengthwise left‐to‐right, as seen bridging in the tower.)\n\n● For the “HOUSE‐LIKE” STRUCTURE\n\n  – Red arch (base):         1 × Block #1  (arch opening faces front, exactly as shown for #1)  \n  – Two small red cubes:     2 × Block #5  (side by side above the arch)  \n  – Two yellow half‐cylinders: 2 × Block #11 (placed horizontally, curved top facing front)  \n  – Orange wedge (roof):     1 × Block #14 (slope running front‐to‐back)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3)  ASSEMBLY ORDER\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA possible step‐by‐step sequence (simply list the moves in a logical build order).  \nUse the template:  { \"Step1\": \"Move block with index …\", … }\n\nFor clarity, one might build the tower first and then the house:\n\n{\n  Step1: \"Move block with index 7\"      // Place tall green pillar for tower\n  Step2: \"Move block with index 5\"      // Bottom red cube, tower right column\n  Step3: \"Move block with index 3\"      // Middle blue cube, tower right column\n  Step4: \"Move block with index 5\"      // Top red cube, tower right column\n  Step5: \"Move block with index 9\"      // Bottom yellow bridge\n  Step6: \"Move block with index 9\"      // Middle yellow bridge\n  Step7: \"Move block with index 9\"      // Top yellow bridge\n\n  // Now build the “house” on the right:\n  Step8:  \"Move block with index 1\"     // Red arch as house base\n  Step9:  \"Move block with index 5\"     // First small red cube above arch (left side)\n  Step10: \"Move block with index 5\"     // Second small red cube above arch (right side)\n  Step11: \"Move block with index 11\"    // First yellow half‐cylinder on top of red cubes\n  Step12: \"Move block with index 11\"    // Second yellow half‐cylinder next to the first\n  Step13: \"Move block with index 14\"    // Orange wedge on very top\n}\n\nThat completes a faithful recreation of the target image using only the listed dictionary blocks in their given orientations.",

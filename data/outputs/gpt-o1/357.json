        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n1. **Overall Block Count and Layers**\n\n   - There are **18 total blocks** in the scene.  \n   -  They arrange into two “buildings” (left and right), each with a red‐block base layer, a mid‐layer of cubes/half‐cylinders/rectangular prisms, and a top layer of roofs or horizontal beams.  In addition, the left building has three tall blocks standing behind it.\n\n2. **Detailed Spatial Breakdown**\n\n   - **Left Building**  \n     • **Bottom layer:** three red blocks in a row.  The left two are clearly red arches (each with a visible curved opening).  The third is a red cube of the same height filling out the right side of this base.  \n     • **Mid‐layer (front):**  \n       – A blue cube sits atop the leftmost red arch.  \n       – Two yellow half‐cylinders span across the middle arch (side‐by‐side).  \n       – An orange cube sits on the red cube at the right end, topped by a red triangular roof.  \n     • **Mid‐layer (rear/center):** a horizontal green rectangular beam bridging behind the half‐cylinders and under the roof line.  \n     • **Rear verticals:** one tall green rectangular prism and two tall yellow rectangular prisms stand up behind the arches and cubes (the “back row” of the structure).\n\n   - **Right Building**  \n     • **Bottom layer:** two red “U‐shaped” curved blocks side by side, forming a wavelike base, plus a red cube at the far right corner.  \n     • **Mid‐layer:** a blue cube rests on the curved blocks in the center, with a green rectangular beam spanning horizontally on top of the blue cube.  \n     • **Top:** an orange triangular roof caps the green beam.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Selection of Required Dictionary Blocks\n\nBelow is the exact set of block indices (and how many times each is used) that match color, shape, and orientation **as shown**—no rotations allowed other than what is pictured in the dictionary:\n\n• **#1 (Red Arch)** – used 2× (the two left‐building arches)  \n• **#2 (Red “U” Block, open‐top)** – used 1× (part of right‐building base)  \n• **#3 (Red “U” Block, mirrored)** – used 1× (part of right‐building base)  \n• **#4** – not used  \n• **#5 (Blue Cube)** – used 2× (one on the left building, one on the right)  \n• **#6 (Orange Cube)** – used 1× (the orange mid tower on the left)  \n• **#7 (Red Cube)** – used 2× (one at the left‐building base, one at the right‐building base)  \n• **#8 (Green Rect. Beam, horizontal)** – used 2× (one bridging the left building, one atop the right blue cube)  \n• **#9 (Green Rect. Beam, vertical)** – used 1× (the tall green piece behind the left building)  \n• **#10** – not used  \n• **#11 (Yellow Tall Rect.)** – used 2× (the two tall yellow pillars at the rear of the left building)  \n• **#12 (Yellow Half‐Cylinder)** – used 2× (the two yellow half‐arches on the left building)  \n• **#13** – not used  \n• **#14 (Orange Triangular Roof)** – used 1× (the roof on the right building)  \n• **#15** – not used  \n• **#16 (Red Triangular Roof)** – used 1× (the roof atop the left orange cube)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Assembly Order\n\nA suitable step‐by‐step sequence (numbering each “move block with index …”) could be:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1  \n  Step3: Move block with index 7  \n  Step4: Move block with index 5  \n  Step5: Move block with index 12  \n  Step6: Move block with index 12  \n  Step7: Move block with index 6  \n  Step8: Move block with index 16  \n  Step9: Move block with index 8  \n  Step10: Move block with index 9  \n  Step11: Move block with index 11  \n  Step12: Move block with index 11  \n  Step13: Move block with index 2  \n  Step14: Move block with index 3  \n  Step15: Move block with index 7  \n  Step16: Move block with index 5  \n  Step17: Move block with index 8  \n  Step18: Move block with index 14  \n}\n\nFollowing those steps in order will reproduce the target structure exactly, using each dictionary piece in the orientation shown.",

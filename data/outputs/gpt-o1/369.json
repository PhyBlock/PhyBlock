Instead, block #1 (the red “arch” piece) can be combined in pairs to form exactly that circular hole.  Two of these arches, placed back‐to‐back, create the ring.  \n     - The two blue cubes (block #3) slide through the center horizontally.\n\n   - **Right “Column” Assembly**  \n     - Composed of three orange cylinders stacked to make one tall column on the left side (all are block #8, which is the vertical orange cylinder).  \n     - A single orange cylinder (again block #8) stands on the right, forming a second “leg.”  \n     - Two yellow rectangular bars bridge between the tall column and the shorter “leg,” forming a sort of “H” or “T” shape.  One bar is oriented as in dictionary block #5; the other oriented as in block #6 (same shape, different orientation).  \n     - An orange wedge block sits atop the tall column (one of #13, #14, #15, or #16).  From the angle shown, #13 is a suitable match.\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**\n\n   - **Left Side:**\n     - Two red arch blocks (#1) are aligned so that their curved openings face each other, creating a ring.  \n     - Two blue cubes (#3) pass through the ring’s center, one on each side.\n   - **Right Side:**\n     - Two orange cylinders (#8) on the ground—one is stacked with a second and third cylinder (#8) to form a tall column.  The other cylinder (#8) remains a single “leg.”  \n     - Two yellow beams (#5 and #6) bridge horizontally between the tall column and the single “leg,” one set slightly above the other.  \n     - One orange wedge (#13) is placed on top of the tall column.\n\n---\n\n**Selection of Required Blocks and Their Indices**\n\n1. **Red Arch (for the ring):** 2 × block #1  \n2. **Blue Cube:** 2 × block #3  \n3. **Orange Cylinder:** 3 × block #8 for the tall column + 1 × block #8 for the right‐side leg = 4 total.  \n   (However, from the image it looks like only three cylinders in total were used: two stacked on the left and one on the right.  If you interpret it as three total cylinders, use “3 × #8.”)  \n4. **Yellow Rectangular Bars:** 1 × block #5 and 1 × block #6 (they are the same shape but oriented at right angles).  \n5. **Orange Wedge (roof):** 1 × block #13\n\n*(If you interpret four total cylinders, then list four #8 blocks.  The image most clearly shows three total, so below uses three.)*\n\nHence the needed indices (assuming 3 total cylinders) are:\n\n• #1 (twice)  \n• #3 (twice)  \n• #8 (three times)  \n• #5 (once)  \n• #6 (once)  \n• #13 (once)\n\n---\n\n**Recommended Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one simple step‐by‐step for placing them (you may of course vary the order as long as the final arrangement is the same):\n\n{\n  \"Step1\":  \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\":  \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\":  \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step4\":  \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step5\":  \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step6\":  \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step7\":  \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step8\":  \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step9\":  \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}",

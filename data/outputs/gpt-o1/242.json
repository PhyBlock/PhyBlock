        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how to reproduce exactly the two “structures” shown in your main image.  I have broken the solution into three parts as requested.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)  DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN (TARGET) IMAGE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•  The Scene Consists of Two Separate Assemblies:\n\n  A)  “Car‐like” Structure on the Left\n     –  Block Count: 5 pieces total  \n     –  Layers:\n        1.  Bottom Layer: Two horizontal orange cylinders side by side (the “wheels”).  \n        2.  Middle Layer: One yellow rectangular block laid horizontally across those cylinders.  \n        3.  Top Layer: A blue cube on one side and a yellow half‐cylinder (arching front‐to‐back) on the other.\n\n  B)  “Tower‐like” Structure on the Right\n     –  Block Count: 8 pieces total  \n     –  Layers (from bottom up):\n        1.  Bottom Layer: One orange triangular wedge to the left and one green rectangular block to the right.\n        2.  Second Layer: A blue cube and a yellow cube on top of the green block.  Next to that stack (on the floor) is a tall orange cylinder standing vertically.\n        3.  Third Layer: A red block with a large semicircular cutout bridging the top of the tall cylinder and the top of the cubes.\n        4.  Fourth/Top Layer: Two small yellow half‐cylinders placed side by side on top of the red block.\n\n•  Total Blocks Used: 13 pieces (5 in the “car” + 8 in the “tower”).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2)  SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is the exact match of each piece in the target image to the block‐dictionary index.  \nNote that no rotation other than what is shown in the dictionary is permitted, so the orientations are chosen to match exactly.\n\n────────────\nA) Car‐like Structure (Left)\n────────────\n1) Two orange horizontal cylinders → Dictionary block #11  \n2) One horizontal yellow rectangular block → Dictionary block #6  \n3) One blue cube → Dictionary block #3  \n4) One yellow half‐cylinder oriented with its curved side on top → Dictionary block #13  \n\n────────────\nB) Tower‐like Structure (Right)\n────────────\n1) One orange wedge (ramp shape) → Dictionary block #15  \n2) One green rectangular block → Dictionary block #5  \n3) One blue cube → Dictionary block #3  (a second copy, same index)  \n4) One yellow cube → Dictionary block #4  \n5) One tall orange cylinder (vertical) → Dictionary block #10  \n6) One red block with a large semicircle cut out → Dictionary block #2  \n7) Two small yellow half‐cylinders (curved side up, left–right) → Dictionary block #12  (two copies)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is one possible order in which to move each block into place.  Use the same block index each time you place an identical piece:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 11   // 1st orange wheel (left structure)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 11   // 2nd orange wheel (left structure)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 6    // Yellow rectangular block across wheels\n  Step4:  Move block with index 13   // Yellow half‐cylinder on top\n  Step5:  Move block with index 3    // Blue cube on top (completes left “car”)\n\n  Step6:  Move block with index 15   // Orange wedge on ground (right structure)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 5    // Green rectangular block to the right\n  Step8:  Move block with index 3    // Blue cube on top of the green block\n  Step9:  Move block with index 4    // Yellow cube next to the blue cube\n  Step10: Move block with index 10   // Tall orange cylinder standing vertically\n  Step11: Move block with index 2    // Red semicircle‑cut block bridging the cubes & cylinder\n  Step12: Move block with index 12   // 1st small yellow half‑cylinder on top\n  Step13: Move block with index 12   // 2nd small yellow half‑cylinder on top\n}\n\nFollowing the above selection and placement faithfully will reproduce the target image exactly as shown.",

        "content": "Below is one systematic way to “read off” the tower from the pictures and match each piece to the block‐dictionary images (without rotating any of them).  I have broken the solution into three parts, as requested.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN (TARGET) IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n•  Total Structures and Block Count  \n   There are two separate little towers.  In total, they use 19 blocks:\n   –  Left (smaller) tower uses 3 blocks.  \n   –  Right (larger) tower uses 16 blocks.\n\n•  Left (smaller) Tower  \n   –  Bottom layer: One short green rectangular prism.  \n   –  Middle layer: One upright orange cylinder (centered on the green block).  \n   –  Top layer: One orange “roof” wedge perched on the cylinder.  \n\n•  Right (larger) Tower (7 layers):\n   1.  Bottom layer: Two red arch‐shaped blocks side by side.  \n   2.  Second layer: A “ring” of four short yellow blocks around the top of the arches.  \n   3.  Third layer: Two red arch‐shaped blocks again, this time oriented so the arch opens upward.  \n   4.  Fourth layer: Another ring of four short yellow blocks.  \n   5.  Fifth layer: Two tall green rectangular prisms (the “columns”) standing side by side.  \n   6.  Sixth layer: One wide yellow block bridging across the two green columns.  \n   7.  Top layer: One orange wedge block sitting in the center as the roof.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING THE CORRECT BLOCKS AND INDICES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nFrom the block‐dictionary image, the required pieces (with their dictionary indices) are as follows:\n\nA)  Left Tower (3 blocks)  \n   •  Green rectangular base → index 4  \n   •  Orange upright cylinder → index 9  \n   •  Orange roof wedge (oriented as shown) → index 14  \n\nB)  Right Tower (16 blocks)  \n   •  Red arch blocks (arch on bottom) → index 1 (×2)  \n   •  Red arch blocks (arch on top) → index 2 (×2)  \n   •  Short yellow rectangular blocks (for the two “rings”) → index 6 (×8 total, four per ring)  \n   •  Tall green rectangular pillars → index 5 (×2)  \n   •  Wide yellow bridging block (spanning the pillars at the top) → index 8 (×1)  \n   •  Orange roof wedge (same orientation as the small tower’s roof) → index 14 (×1)  \n\nIn summary, the dictionary indices needed are:\n •  #1 (2×), #2 (2×), #4 (1×), #5 (2×), #6 (8×), #8 (1×), #9 (1×), and #14 (2×).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is one logical order (you may of course reorder so long as you build bottom‐to‐top).\n\n{\n Step1:  Move block with index 4   (place the small green base for the left tower)\n Step2:  Move block with index 9   (stand the orange cylinder on the green base)\n Step3:  Move block with index 14  (add the orange wedge roof on top of the cylinder)\n\n -- Begin the right tower --\n Step4:  Move block with index 1   (first red arch on bottom layer)\n Step5:  Move block with index 1   (second red arch on bottom layer)\n Step6:  Move block with index 6   (first yellow block of the second-layer ring)\n Step7:  Move block with index 6   (second yellow block of that ring)\n Step8:  Move block with index 6   (third yellow block of that ring)\n Step9:  Move block with index 6   (fourth yellow block of that ring)\n Step10: Move block with index 2   (first red arch of the third layer)\n Step11: Move block with index 2   (second red arch of the third layer)\n Step12: Move block with index 6   (first yellow block of the fourth-layer ring)\n Step13: Move block with index 6   (second yellow block of that ring)\n Step14: Move block with index 6   (third yellow block of that ring)\n Step15: Move block with index 6   (fourth yellow block of that ring)\n Step16: Move block with index 5   (first tall green column)\n Step17: Move block with index 5   (second tall green column)\n Step18: Move block with index 8   (wide yellow block bridging the two columns)\n Step19: Move block with index 14  (orange wedge roof on top)\n}\n\nThat completes the structure shown in the target image, using each block just as it appears in the dictionary (no rotations beyond what is shown).",

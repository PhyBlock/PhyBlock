        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can analyze and then rebuild exactly what is shown in the two target “buildings.”  For clarity, I will refer to the left structure as “Structure A” and the right structure as “Structure B.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\n■ OVERALL LAYOUT\nThere are two separate constructions in the scene:\n\n• Structure A (on the left):  \n  – Five total layers from bottom to top.  \n  – Bottom “legs” are blue, a yellow “belt” around the middle, red/blue blocks making up the tall mid‐section, a green rectangular block above that, and finally an orange peaked roof.\n\n• Structure B (on the right):  \n  – Four total layers.  \n  – Red arch blocks at the base, a full ring of yellow planks in the second layer, another pair of red arches in the third layer, and two red rectangular blocks (cubes) on top.\n\n■ STRUCTURE A LAYER‐BY‐LAYER\n  1. Bottom Layer: Four small blue cubes forming a 2×2 footprint (two in front, two in back).  \n  2. Second Layer: A “belt” of yellow.  From the dictionary, the only thin horizontal yellow plank is block #13, so four #13 planks arranged in a ring around the top of the blue cubes.  \n  3. Third Layer: Two cubes side by side (one blue, one red) to form the narrower tower portion.  \n  4. Fourth Layer: A single green rectangular block laid flat as a band (block #9 from the dictionary).  \n  5. Fifth Layer: The orange “roof,” which is actually two triangular wedges meeting in the middle.  From the dictionary, these are #15 and #16 (matching left‐ and right‐angled roof pieces).\n\n■ STRUCTURE B LAYER‐BY‐LAYER\n  1. Bottom Layer: Two red arch blocks (#1) side by side.  They are oriented so the arch is visible from the front (which matches block #1 exactly).  \n  2. Second Layer: A full ring of four yellow planks (#13 again) bridging across the tops of the two arches.  \n  3. Third Layer: Another two red arch blocks (#1) stacked above that yellow ring.  \n  4. Fourth/Top Layer: Two red cubes (#6), side by side, forming the rectangular “roof” of this arch structure.\n\n■ TOTAL BLOCK COUNT\n  • Structure A uses 13 blocks.  \n  • Structure B uses 10 blocks.  \n  • Overall, 23 blocks in total.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBased on the above analysis, these are the exact dictionary indices (with their original orientations) that you need.  Note that each index can be repeated as many times as required:\n\n• Red arch (front‐to‐back opening):  #1  \n• Blue cube:                         #5  \n• Red cube:                          #6  \n• Green flat rectangular block:      #9  \n• Yellow plank (horizontal):         #13  \n• Orange triangular wedge (left):    #15  \n• Orange triangular wedge (right):   #16  \n\nCounts/Uses in Each Structure:\n\nStructure A (Left):\n  – Blue cube (#5):  5 times total (4 in bottom layer + 1 in third layer)  \n  – Yellow plank (#13): 4 times (the “belt” ring)  \n  – Red cube (#6): 1 time (in the third layer)  \n  – Green block (#9): 1 time (fourth layer)  \n  – Orange wedges (#15, #16): 1 each (fifth/top layer)\n\nStructure B (Right):\n  – Red arch (#1): 4 times total (2 in bottom layer + 2 in third layer)  \n  – Yellow plank (#13): 4 times (second‐layer ring)  \n  – Red cube (#6): 2 times (top layer)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is one possible order in which to place the 23 blocks.  The key requirement is simply that lower‐layer blocks be placed before anything resting on them.\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 5  (blue cube, bottom layer of A)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 5  (blue cube, bottom layer of A)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 5  (blue cube, bottom layer of A)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 5  (blue cube, bottom layer of A)\n\n  Step5:  Move block with index 13 (yellow plank, second layer of A)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 13 (yellow plank, second layer of A)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 13 (yellow plank, second layer of A)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 13 (yellow plank, second layer of A)\n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 5  (blue cube, third layer of A)\n  Step10: Move block with index 6  (red cube, third layer of A)\n  Step11: Move block with index 9  (green rectangular block, fourth layer of A)\n  Step12: Move block with index 15 (orange wedge, top layer of A)\n  Step13: Move block with index 16 (orange wedge, top layer of A)\n\n  Step14: Move block with index 1  (red arch, bottom layer of B)\n  Step15: Move block with index 1  (red arch, bottom layer of B)\n\n  Step16: Move block with index 13 (yellow plank, second layer of B)\n  Step17: Move block with index 13 (yellow plank, second layer of B)\n  Step18: Move block with index 13 (yellow plank, second layer of B)\n  Step19: Move block with index 13 (yellow plank, second layer of B)\n\n  Step20: Move block with index 1  (red arch, third layer of B)\n  Step21: Move block with index 1  (red arch, third layer of B)\n\n  Step22: Move block with index 6  (red cube, top layer of B)\n  Step23: Move block with index 6  (red cube, top layer of B)\n}\n\nFollowing that sequence (or any logically equivalent bottom‐to‐top approach) will reproduce both “house” structures exactly as shown, without rotating any piece beyond its original dictionary orientation.",

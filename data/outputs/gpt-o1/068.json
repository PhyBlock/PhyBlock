The bottom layer has 1 green cube (center) and 2 orange triangular wedges (left/right). The second layer has 1 green cube stacked on top of the first. The top (third) layer is an orange “roof” wedge.\n\n• Spatial Arrangement  \n  – Bottom layer: A single green cube is in the center. An orange triangular wedge is attached on the left face of that cube, and an identically oriented orange triangular wedge is attached on the right face.  \n  – Second layer: Another green cube is centered directly over the lower green cube.  \n  – Third (top) layer: An orange roof‐shaped wedge rests on top of the upper green cube.\n\n2)  Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\n• Green Cubes (2×): Block index 2 (the green cube).  \n• Roof Wedge (1×): Block index 7 (the orange roof‐shaped wedge).  \n• Left Triangular Wedge (1×): Block index 13 (orange triangular piece, orientation matching the left side).  \n• Right Triangular Wedge (1×): Block index 14 (orange triangular piece, orientation matching the right side).\n\n3)  Assembly Order\n\n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 2  \n  Step2: Move block with index 13  \n  Step3: Move block with index 14  \n  Step4: Move block with index 2  \n  Step5: Move block with index 7  \n}",

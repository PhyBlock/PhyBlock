The bottom layer is a single red arch‐shaped block. Above it (second layer) are two triangular wedges, meeting at a peak to form the “roof.”\n\n• **Spatial Arrangement:**  \n  – **Bottom Layer:** One red arched block standing upright.  \n  – **Top Layer:** Two orange wedge blocks placed side by side on top of the arch so that their sloping edges meet in the center, creating a pitched roof shape.  \n\n**2) Selecting the Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\nFrom the dictionary image, the matching shapes (including correct color and orientation) are:\n\n1. **Red Arch Block (#1)** for the base.  \n2. **Orange Wedge Blocks (#13 and #14)** used as mirror‐image roof halves.\n\nHence the needed indices are:  \n• 1 × Block #1  \n• 1 × Block #13  \n• 1 × Block #14  \n\n**3) Step‐by‐Step Assembly Order**\n\nUse the template format:\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:  \n• First place the red arch block (#1) as the foundation.  \n• Next place the left‐side orange wedge (#13) on top.  \n• Finally place the right‐side orange wedge (#14) so it meets #13 at the roof peak.",

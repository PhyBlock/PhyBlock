ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n\n   •  Block Count and Layers  \n      -  The structure uses a total of 6 blocks.  \n      -  Visually it can be thought of in three “layers”:  \n         1) A flat green rectangular block at the bottom,  \n         2) Three tall yellow pillars and one red cube in the middle,  \n         3) A flat green rectangular block on top.  \n\n   •  Spatial Arrangement  \n      -  The bottom green block forms a horizontal base.  \n      -  Three tall yellow rectangular blocks stand upright on this base: two at the “front” edges and one behind them, leaving an open center space.  \n      -  A red cube sits on the bottom green block, centered between the three yellow pillars.  \n      -  A second green rectangular block spans across the top of the three yellow pillars, serving as the top “cap.”  \n\n2.  SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n\n   •  Required Shapes, Colors, and Orientations  \n      1) Two green flat (horizontal) rectangular blocks for the top and bottom → dictionary block index 7 (used twice).  \n      2) Three tall yellow rectangular pillars → dictionary block index 13 (used three times).  \n      3) One red cube → dictionary block index 4.  \n\n   •  Final List of Block Indices  \n      [7, 13, 13, 13, 4, 7]  \n\n   (Order here is not necessarily assembly order—just the set of blocks needed.)\n\n3.  ASSEMBLY ORDER\n\n   Below is one possible step‐by‐step sequence using the required blocks exactly in their dictionary orientations:\n\n   {\n     Step1: Move block with index 7   (place the bottom green rectangle)\n     Step2: Move block with index 13  (place the first tall yellow pillar)\n     Step3: Move block with index 13  (place the second tall yellow pillar)\n     Step4: Move block with index 13  (place the third tall yellow pillar)\n     Step5: Move block with index 4   (place the red cube in the center)\n     Step6: Move block with index 7   (place the top green rectangle)\n   }",

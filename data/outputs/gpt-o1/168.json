In parentheses is the quantity used.\n\n• Red Arch (index 1) … 2×  \n• Orange Cylinder (index 12) … 5× (1 for the left cylinder + 4 for the right columns)  \n• Orange Wedge (index 14) … 1× (the “roof” piece on top of the left cylinder)  \n• Tall Yellow Rectangular Block (index 10) … 1×  \n• Small Green Rectangular Block (index 4) … 1× (behind the cylinder on the left)  \n• Green Rectangular Block (index 5) … 2× (the pair forming the top platform on the right)  \n\nAssembly Order\n--------------\n{  \n  Step1:  Move block with index 1  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 1  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 12  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 10  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 4  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 14  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 12  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 12  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 12  \n  Step10: Move block with index 12  \n  Step11: Move block with index 5  \n  Step12: Move block with index 5  \n}",

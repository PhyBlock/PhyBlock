        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n1. **Block Count and Layers**  \n   - The model is made of 4 total blocks.  \n   - From bottom to top there are essentially two “wheel” cylinders on the ground‐level, one horizontal rectangular block resting atop those wheels, and finally one cube set on the center of the rectangle.\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**  \n   - **Bottom Layer (Wheels):** Two orange cylinders lie side by side in a strictly horizontal orientation.  \n   - **Middle Layer (Base):** A single yellow rectangular block spans across (left to right) and rests on top of both cylinders.  \n   - **Top Layer (Cube):** One blue cube is centered on (and sitting directly above) the yellow rectangular block.\n   \nBecause the dictionary does **not** include perfectly horizontal orange cylinders (the only orange cylinders provided are at an angle), the best approximation (without “rotating” any blocks ourselves) is to use the angled orange cylinders from the dictionary as “wheels.” Although they appear slightly tilted in the dictionary, they are the only orange cylinders available.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\n- **Blue Cube**:  Block index **1**  \n- **Yellow Horizontal Rectangular Block**:  For the yellow base with left‐to‐right orientation, use block index **6**.  \n- **Orange Cylinders** (wheels):  The only orange cylinders shown are indices **13** and **14**, each tilted at opposing angles.  Since we need two side‐by‐side wheels, we will use one of each to mirror one another.  \n\nHence, the four blocks you will need are:  \n• Two copies of index 13/14 (one of each for left and right wheels)  \n• One copy of index 6 (the yellow base)  \n• One copy of index 1 (the blue cube)\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step instructions (indices match those from the dictionary exactly, with no rotation):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 13  (first “wheel”)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 14  (second “wheel”)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 6   (yellow rectangular base)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 1   (blue cube on top)\n}",

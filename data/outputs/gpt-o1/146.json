        "content": "Below is one workable “breakdown” of the tower as it appears in your target image, followed by which dictionary blocks match each part (without any re‐orientation) and a sample step‐by‐step build order.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE TARGET STRUCTURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Total Block Count: 10  \n• Layers (roughly three “levels”):  \n  – Level 1 (the base):  \n     • 3 orange cylinders on the ground (two “legs” at the front, one forming the bottom of the tall column).  \n  – Level 2 (mid‐platform and tower continuation):  \n     • 1 more orange cylinder stacked on the tall column.  \n     • 1 wide yellow rectangular block bridging the two front cylinders and the tower cylinder.  \n     • 2 red arch blocks perched on top of that platform at right angles to each other, with a yellow half‐cylinder fitted between them (at “arch‐height”).  \n  – Level 3 (top pieces):  \n     • Another yellow half‐cylinder bridging across the two red arches at the top.  \n     • An orange “roof‐wedge” capping the tall column.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  WHICH DICTIONARY BLOCKS ARE USED\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow are the 10 pieces (by their dictionary indices) that match both color and orientation exactly as shown.  No rotations beyond how they appear in the dictionary are allowed.  \n\n• Four (4) Orange Cylinders  \n  – Block #8 (used four times)  \n• One (1) Orange “Roof‐Wedge”  \n  – Block #15 (the wedge oriented so that it sits neatly on top of the cylinder)  \n• One (1) Wide Yellow Rectangular Platform  \n  – Block #5  \n• Two (2) Yellow Half‐Cylinders  \n  – Block #9 (used twice, one tucked under the arches, one on top)  \n• Two (2) Red Arch Blocks  \n  – Block #1 (arch opening spans left‐to‐right)  \n  – Block #2 (arch opening spans front‐to‐back)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  EXAMPLE ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a sample order in which one might place these blocks (you can vary this as needed).  Use the exact format “StepX: Move block with index …”\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 8   // Place first orange cylinder (front left leg)\n  Step2: Move block with index 8   // Place second orange cylinder (front right leg)\n  Step3: Move block with index 8   // Place third orange cylinder (tower base)\n  Step4: Move block with index 8   // Stack fourth orange cylinder on top of tower base\n  Step5: Move block with index 5   // Lay down the wide yellow platform across the front legs and tower\n  Step6: Move block with index 1   // Put first red arch (arch opening L‐R) on the platform\n  Step7: Move block with index 2   // Put second red arch (arch opening F‐B) next to the first arch\n  Step8: Move block with index 9   // Insert first yellow half‐cylinder between arches (lower position)\n  Step9: Move block with index 9   // Add second yellow half‐cylinder bridging arches at the top\n  Step10: Move block with index 15 // Finally place the orange roof‐wedge atop the tall column\n}\n\nThat set of 10 blocks (indices #8, #15, #5, #9, #1, and #2 used as noted) reproduces the shape, color‐placement, and orientations seen in your target image.",

Above it is a horizontally‐placed green rectangular block.  \n    3.  Above that is a blue cube.  \n    4.  Capping the cube is an orange wedge (roof shape).  \n    5.  Next to the arch tower is a vertical orange cylinder with another orange wedge on top.  \n  – Right “Vehicle”:  \n    1.  Two horizontally‐lying orange cylinders form the “wheels.”  \n    2.  A horizontal yellow rectangular block rests across the two cylinders.  \n    3.  A blue cube sits on top of the yellow block (as the “cab”).  \n\n•  Block Count and Layers:  \n  – The left tower effectively has four layers (arch → green block → cube → roof), plus an adjacent cylinder‐plus‐roof.  \n  – The right vehicle has two layers of wheels, then a yellow block, then a blue cube.  \n\nSelecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary  \n•  Matching Each Piece Exactly (no re‐orientations allowed):  \n  1.  Red arch at the tower base → Dictionary index 1  \n  2.  Green rectangular block (horizontal) → Dictionary index 5  \n  3.  Blue cube (used twice: tower and vehicle) → Dictionary index 3 (×2)  \n  4.  Orange wedge/roof (front‐to‐back orientation) → Dictionary index 15 (×2)  \n  5.  Vertical orange cylinder → Dictionary index 9  \n  6.  Two orange cylinders lying horizontally (vehicle wheels) → Dictionary index 10 (×2)  \n  7.  Yellow rectangular block (horizontal) → Dictionary index 7  \n\nAssembly Order  \n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 5  \n  Step3: Move block with index 3  \n  Step4: Move block with index 15  \n  Step5: Move block with index 9  \n  Step6: Move block with index 15  \n  Step7: Move block with index 10  \n  Step8: Move block with index 10  \n  Step9: Move block with index 7  \n  Step10: Move block with index 3  \n}  ",

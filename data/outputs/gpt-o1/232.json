        "content": "**1) Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\nThere are **two separate structures**:\n\n• **Left‐Hand Structure**  \n  – **Total of 5 blocks**  \n    1. A short, flat green rectangular block at the bottom (the cylinder sits “through” it).  \n    2. One upright orange cylinder in the center.  \n    3. Another short, flat green rectangular block on top of the cylinder.  \n    4–5. Two tall green rectangular blocks standing side by side on the very top.  \n  – You can view this as **3 layers**:  \n    1) Bottom green block  \n    2) Cylinder + top green block  \n    3) Two tall green blocks\n\n• **Right‐Hand Structure**  \n  – **Total of 9 blocks**  \n    1–2. Two tall green rectangular blocks on the ground (left and right).  \n    3–5. Three upright orange cylinders in the center, side by side.  \n    6–7. Two orange triangular wedges at the left and right bases.  \n    8–9. Two orange triangular wedges on top, forming a “roof.”  \n  – This forms **3 layers**:  \n    1) Base green blocks + base wedges + cylinders (all on the ground)  \n    2) The main cylinder “column” + tall green blocks  \n    3) Two triangular wedges on top as a roof\n\n**2) Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nMatching each piece exactly (same shape, color, and orientation—no re‐orienting allowed):\n\n• **Left Structure**  \n  – Bottom green block: Index #1 (short green block, long side left‐to‐right).  \n  – Upright orange cylinder: Index #7.  \n  – Top green block (directly above cylinder): again Index #1.  \n  – Two tall green rectangular blocks on top: each is Index #4 (tall, narrow‐face forward).\n\n• **Right Structure**  \n  – Two tall green rectangular blocks on the outer sides: each is Index #3 (tall, wide‐face forward).  \n  – Three upright orange cylinders side by side: all are Index #7 again.  \n  – Four triangular orange wedges:  \n    • Bottom left wedge: Index #13.  \n    • Bottom right wedge: Index #14.  \n    • Top left wedge: Index #11.  \n    • Top right wedge: Index #12.\n\nHence the full list of required blocks (by index) with repetitions:  \n• #1 (used twice), #3 (used twice), #4 (used twice), #7 (used four times), #11, #12, #13, #14\n\n**3) Assembly Order**\n\nA sample step‐by‐step sequence (one step per block) could be:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1   (left-structure bottom)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 7   (left-structure cylinder)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 1   (left-structure top plate)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 4   (first tall green pillar on left structure)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 4   (second tall green pillar on left structure)  \n\n  Step6: Move block with index 3   (right-structure tall green block on left)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 3   (right-structure tall green block on right)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 13  (bottom-left orange wedge)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 14  (bottom-right orange wedge)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 7  (first orange cylinder, center)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 7  (second orange cylinder)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 7  (third orange cylinder)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 11 (top-left wedge)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 12 (top-right wedge)  \n}\n\nThis completes the final arrangement exactly as shown in the target image.",

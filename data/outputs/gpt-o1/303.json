        "content": "**1) Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image**\n\n- **Overall Layout**  \n  There are two separate “buildings” in the image—a tall tower on the left (7 blocks) and a “house” on the right (also 7 blocks). Thus, the total structure uses 14 blocks.\n\n- **Left Tower (7 blocks, 5 layers)**  \n  1. **Layer 1 (bottom):** Two cubes side‐by‐side: red (left), yellow (right).  \n  2. **Layer 2:** Two cubes side‐by‐side: orange (left), red (right).  \n  3. **Layer 3:** A short green rectangular block laid horizontally across the tops of the two cubes below.  \n  4. **Layer 4:** A single blue cube centered on top of the green rectangle.  \n  5. **Layer 5 (top):** A single red cube on top.\n\n- **Right House (7 blocks, 4 layers)**  \n  1. **Layer 1 (bottom):** Two cubes side‐by‐side: blue (left), orange (right).  \n  2. **Layer 2:** Two orange cubes side‐by‐side (left and right).  \n  3. **Layer 3:** A short green rectangular block laid horizontally across the tops of the two orange cubes.  \n  4. **Layer 4 (roof):** Two orange triangular blocks side‐by‐side forming a peaked roof.\n\n---\n\n**2) Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nBelow are the dictionary indices (in **bold**) of the exact‐orientation blocks needed. Note that the same index may be reused multiple times.\n\n- **Left Tower (7 pieces)**  \n  - 3× **#4** (Red cube)  \n  - 1× **#5** (Yellow cube)  \n  - 1× **#3** (Orange cube)  \n  - 1× **#6** (Short green rectangular block, horizontal orientation)  \n  - 1× **#1** (Blue cube)  \n\n- **Right House (7 pieces)**  \n  - 1× **#1** (Blue cube)  \n  - 3× **#3** (Orange cube)  \n  - 1× **#6** (Short green rectangular block, horizontal orientation)  \n  - 1× **#13** (Orange triangular block, left‐slope orientation)  \n  - 1× **#14** (Orange triangular block, right‐slope orientation)  \n\n---\n\n**3) Step‐by‐Step Assembly Order**\n\nA sensible way to place them (tower first, then house) is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 4  (Left Tower bottom-left red cube)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 5  (Left Tower bottom-right yellow cube)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 3  (Left Tower second-layer orange cube, left side)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 4  (Left Tower second-layer red cube, right side)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 6  (Left Tower green rectangular block bridging third layer)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 1  (Left Tower blue cube on top of green)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 4  (Left Tower top red cube)\n\n  Step8:  Move block with index 1  (Right House bottom-left blue cube)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 3  (Right House bottom-right orange cube)\n  Step10: Move block with index 3  (Right House second-layer orange cube, left side)\n  Step11: Move block with index 3  (Right House second-layer orange cube, right side)\n  Step12: Move block with index 6  (Right House green rectangular block bridging third layer)\n  Step13: Move block with index 13 (Right House left roof triangle)\n  Step14: Move block with index 14 (Right House right roof triangle)\n}\n```",

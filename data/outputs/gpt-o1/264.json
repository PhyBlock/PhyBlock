        "content": "**Analysis of Main Target Image**\n\n1. **Overall Count and Layers**  \n   - There are **two separate sub‐structures** in the image, using a total of **10 blocks**.  \n   - **Left “tower” sub‐structure (4 blocks)** has 4 vertical layers:  \n     • Bottom layer: a red arch block (the “doorway”).  \n     • Second layer: a green rectangular block.  \n     • Third layer: a blue cube.  \n     • Top layer: an orange wedge “roof.”  \n   - **Right “frame” sub‐structure (6 blocks)** can be viewed in four layers (from bottom to top):  \n     • Bottom layer: a long yellow plank.  \n     • Second layer: red arch (bottom half of the circular opening) plus two tall green columns (left and right).  \n     • Third layer: red arch (top half of the circular opening).  \n     • Top layer: another yellow plank.  \n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**  \n   - **Tower:**  \n     • The red arch sits on the ground.  \n     • The green rectangular block rests directly on top of that arch.  \n     • A blue cube sits centered on the green block.  \n     • Finally, an orange wedge roof caps the top of the cube.  \n   - **Frame:**  \n     • A yellow plank spans horizontally at the bottom.  \n     • Stacked on it in the center are two red arch blocks, one inverted on top of the other, forming a circular hole in front view.  \n     • On the far left and right of those arches are two tall green blocks standing vertically.  \n     • A second yellow plank caps the structure at the top.  \n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nBelow are the dictionary indices (with repeats allowed) that match **exactly** in shape/orientation:\n\n- **Tower (4 blocks):**  \n  1. Red arch (index #1) — arch facing forward at the bottom.  \n  2. Green rectangular (index #7) — laid horizontally on top of the arch.  \n  3. Blue cube (index #5).  \n  4. Orange wedge roof (index #13).  \n\n- **Frame (6 blocks):**  \n  1. Red arch with arch on the bottom (index #1) — forms the top half of the circular hole.  \n  2. Red arch with arch on the top (index #2) — forms the bottom half of the circular hole.  \n  3. Two tall green blocks (index #9) — left and right vertical supports.  \n  4. Two yellow planks (index #11) — one for the very bottom; one for the very top.  \n\nSo in total, the indices used are  \n{1, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 9, 11, 11, 13}.  \n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one possible step‐by‐step way of stacking them (bottom‐to‐top, left‐to‐right):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1     // Tower base arch  \n  Step2: Move block with index 7     // Green rectangular above arch  \n  Step3: Move block with index 5     // Blue cube above green block  \n  Step4: Move block with index 13    // Orange roof on top of cube  \n  Step5: Move block with index 11    // Bottom yellow plank for frame  \n  Step6: Move block with index 2     // Red arch (bottom half of circle)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 9     // Left tall green column  \n  Step8: Move block with index 9     // Right tall green column  \n  Step9: Move block with index 1     // Red arch (top half of circle)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 11   // Top yellow plank\n}",

It matches both top and bottom arches seen in the target (no other rotation is allowed, so we use #7 as‐is for both).  \n\n- **Green rectangular blocks (second & fourth layers):** Block #8 is the short, horizontally oriented green brick. We need two of these in exactly that orientation.  \n\n- **Yellow half‐cylinders (middle layer):** To form a full circle when placed side by side (with no rotation), one half‐cylinder must have its flat side facing one way and the other must be its mirror. The dictionary shows #12 and #16 as mirror‐image yellow half‐cylinders. Placed side by side, they form the circle seen in the middle.  \n\nThus, the required block indices and their usage are:  \n• Red arch: #7 (used twice)  \n• Green rectangular brick: #8 (used twice)  \n• Yellow half‐cylinder: #12 (one piece)  \n• Yellow half‐cylinder: #16 (one piece)  \n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nA straightforward bottom‐to‐top build sequence would be:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7   // bottom red arch  \n  Step2: Move block with index 8   // lower green block  \n  Step3: Move block with index 12  // first yellow half‐cylinder  \n  Step4: Move block with index 16  // second yellow half‐cylinder  \n  Step5: Move block with index 8   // upper green block  \n  Step6: Move block with index 7   // top red arch  \n}",

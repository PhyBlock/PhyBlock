Two orange cylinders stand vertically between the bottom and middle yellow rectangles, and two green rectangular prisms stand vertically between the middle and top yellow rectangles. An orange triangular “roof” block caps the tower.  \n   - In the right “car,” two horizontal orange cylinders form “wheels,” a single horizontal yellow rectangular block rests on top of the wheels, a blue cube is placed on one end of that yellow block, and an orange triangular “roof” block sits on top of the blue cube.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks**\n\nFrom the dictionary image (indices 1–16), the following exact matches (with correct orientations) are needed:\n\n• **Blue cube**: #1 (used once, on the right car).  \n• **Green vertical rectangular prism**: #3 (used twice, for the tower).  \n• **Yellow horizontal rectangular block**: #5 (used four times: three in the tower, one in the car).  \n• **Orange vertical cylinder**: #7 (used twice, for the tower’s columns).  \n• **Orange horizontal cylinder**: #9 (used twice, for the car’s wheels).  \n• **Orange triangular roof piece**: #11 (used twice: one atop the tower, one atop the car’s blue cube).\n\nHence the **required indices** are:  \n[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]  \nwith counts:  \n• #1 × 1  \n• #3 × 2  \n• #5 × 4  \n• #7 × 2  \n• #9 × 2  \n• #11 × 2  \n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nA suitable step‐by‐step instruction list (building the tall tower first, then the car) could be:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 5   (place bottom yellow rectangle for tower)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 7   (place first vertical orange cylinder)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 7   (place second vertical orange cylinder)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 5   (place middle yellow rectangle atop cylinders)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 3   (place first vertical green prism)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 3   (place second vertical green prism)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 5   (place top yellow rectangle)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 11  (place orange roof piece on tower)  \n\n  Step9: Move block with index 9   (place first horizontal orange cylinder/wheel)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 9  (place second horizontal orange cylinder/wheel)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 5  (place yellow rectangle “chassis” on wheels)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 1  (place blue cube on chassis)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 11 (place orange roof on blue cube)\n}",

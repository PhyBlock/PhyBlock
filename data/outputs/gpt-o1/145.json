Two upright cylinders on the ground.  \n     2. The yellow rectangular beam laid horizontally bridging those two cylinders.  \n     3. A third cylinder standing on top of one of the base cylinders (continuing upward).  \n     4. Another cylinder stacked above the third, with the orange roof block sitting on top.\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**  \n   - The two orange cylinders at the bottom stand upright and are side‐by‐side.  \n   - The yellow rectangular block rests across the tops of both those base cylinders (so it spans from one cylinder to the other).  \n   - A third orange cylinder stands on top of one of the base cylinders (towering above the yellow block). A fourth cylinder continues directly above it, making a tall column.  \n   - Finally, the orange roof‐shaped piece sits at the very top of the column.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\n- **4 × Block #4**  \n  (Orange cylinder in the vertical orientation)  \n- **1 × Block #1**  \n  (Yellow rectangular prism oriented “flat”/horizontal)  \n- **1 × Block #8**  \n  (Orange roof block oriented exactly as shown)\n\nThese choices match exactly the color and orientation seen in the target image without any rotation.\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step sequence (adding one block per step):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4  \n  Step2: Move block with index 4  \n  Step3: Move block with index 1  \n  Step4: Move block with index 4  \n  Step5: Move block with index 4  \n  Step6: Move block with index 8  \n}\n\nThis places the two base cylinders first, then the yellow bridging block, then stacks the next two vertical cylinders for the tall column, and finally crowns it with the roof (block #8).",

        "content": "Below is one way to “read off” the large arch‐and‐roof structure plus the smaller arch‐and‐wedge exactly as shown, using the block orientations from your dictionary.  \n\n--------------------------------\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET\n--------------------------------\n•  Total Blocks / Layers\n   – There are 8 total blocks used in the scene.  \n   – The taller “gateway” on the left is made of 6 blocks in three vertical layers:  \n     1st Layer: two green columns + one yellow block bridging them  \n     2nd Layer: a red arch block  \n     3rd Layer: two orange wedges forming a peaked roof  \n\n   – The smaller structure on the right uses 2 blocks in two layers:  \n     1st Layer: a red arch block  \n     2nd Layer: one orange wedge on top  \n\n•  Spatial Arrangement\n   – “Gateway” (left):\n     • Two tall green columns stand upright, side by side.  \n     • A single yellow rectangular block lies horizontally across the tops of the two columns.  \n     • Centered on top of that yellow beam is a red arch (opening faces front‐to‐back).  \n     • Two orange triangular wedges sit on the arch to form a symmetrical pitched roof.  \n   – Small Arch (right):\n     • A red arch (same front‐to‐back orientation) stands by itself.  \n     • A single orange wedge rests on top of that smaller arch.  \n\n---------------------------------------\n2)  SELECTING BLOCKS FROM DICTIONARY\n---------------------------------------\n•  Green Columns  \n  – Use block #5 (green rectangular prism in the correct tall‐upright orientation).  \n  – You need 2 copies of #5 (one for each column).  \n\n•  Yellow Bridging Block  \n  – Use block #8 (yellow rectangular prism oriented lengthwise, matching the horizontal “lintel”).  \n  – You need 1 copy of #8.  \n\n•  Red Arches  \n  – Use block #1 (red arch oriented with the curved opening front‐to‐back).  \n  – You need 2 copies of #1 (one for the large gateway and one for the smaller arch).  \n\n•  Orange Roof Wedges  \n  – Use blocks #15 and #16 for the two‐piece pitched roof on the large arch (they are mirror‐image wedges oriented front‐to‐back).  \n  – Use one additional #16 wedge for the smaller arch’s top (same front‐to‐back slope).  \n  – Hence a total of 1×#15 and 2×#16 are required.  \n\nIn summary, the block “shopping list” is:  \n•  #5 (green) × 2  \n•  #8 (yellow) × 1  \n•  #1 (red)   × 2  \n•  #15 (orange) × 1  \n•  #16 (orange) × 2  \n\n--------------------------------\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY\n--------------------------------\nBelow is one possible build sequence:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 5   (place left green column)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 5   (place right green column)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 8   (bridge columns with the yellow beam)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 1   (set the red arch on top of yellow beam)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 15  (place first orange wedge for the roof)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 16  (place second orange wedge for the roof)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 1   (build the smaller free‐standing arch)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 16  (add the single orange wedge on top of smaller arch)  \n}\n\nThat completes the structure precisely as shown in the target image.",

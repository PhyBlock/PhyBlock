        "content": "Below is one systematic way to reproduce both the “star”‐shaped object on the left and the “rocket”‐shaped object on the right exactly as shown, **without** rotating any blocks beyond how they appear in the dictionary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) ANALYSIS OF MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n■ Overall there are two separate builds:\n\nA) The “Star” on the Left  \n   • Single‐layer construction (1 layer high).  \n   • Center: 1 green cube.  \n   • Surrounding Cross: 4 blue cubes (one on each side of the green center).  \n   • Corners: 4 orange triangular wedges, each sloping outward/downward from the blue cubes.  \n   → Total of 1 (green) + 4 (blue) + 4 (orange wedges) = 9 blocks.\n\nB) The “Rocket” on the Right  \n   • Three distinct layers:  \n     – Bottom Layer:  \n        1 red “ring” block (the circular hole in the center)  \n        2 yellow cubes (left and right corners)  \n        2 orange wedges (forming the slanted sides on the bottom)  \n     – Middle Layer:  \n        1 green cube (left)  \n        1 blue cube (right)  \n     – Top Layer (“roof”):  \n        2 orange wedges meeting at a peak  \n   → Total of 1 (red ring) + 2 (yellow) + 2 (orange wedges on bottom) + 2 (orange wedges on top) + 1 (green) + 1 (blue) = 9 blocks.\n\n■ Grand Total Across Both Builds  \n   9 blocks in the star + 9 blocks in the rocket = 18 blocks used.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) SELECTING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is one possible matching that respects shape, color, and orientation exactly:\n\nA) Blocks for the “Star” (9 total):  \n   • (1) Green cube: dictionary index 5  \n   • (4) Blue cubes: dictionary index 4 (used 4 times)  \n   • (4) Orange wedges (all the same orientation for the corners): dictionary index 14 (used 4 times, for example)\n\nB) Blocks for the “Rocket” (9 total):  \n   • (1) Red ring (circular hole): dictionary index 3  \n   • (2) Yellow cubes: dictionary index 6 (used twice)  \n   • (2) Orange wedges for bottom corners: dictionary indices 12 and 13 (mirrored pair)  \n   • (1) Green cube (upper layer): dictionary index 5  \n   • (1) Blue cube (upper layer): dictionary index 4  \n   • (2) Orange wedges for the roof: dictionary indices 12 and 13 again (another mirrored pair)\n\nNote:\n – A perfect cube’s “orientation” does not change its appearance, so index 4 is chosen for all blue cubes.  \n – Likewise index 5 (green) and index 6 (yellow) are each unique for their color so those choices are unambiguous.  \n – For the orange wedges, we pair up complementary orientations (e.g. #12 and #13) so that one slopes left, the other slopes right, matching the “roof” or the “bottom‐corner” angles in the target.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) STEP‑BY‑STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is an example of how one might place the blocks in sequence.  \nUse the same pattern for the “Star” first, then the “Rocket,” or vice versa.\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 5  (place green cube for star center)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 4  (1st blue cube around star center)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 4  (2nd blue cube around star center)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 4  (3rd blue cube around star center)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 4  (4th blue cube around star center)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 14 (1st orange wedge corner of star)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 14 (2nd orange wedge corner of star)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 14 (3rd orange wedge corner of star)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 14 (4th orange wedge corner of star)\n  \n  Step10: Move block with index 3  (red ring at rocket bottom center)\n  Step11: Move block with index 6  (1st yellow cube at bottom corner)\n  Step12: Move block with index 6  (2nd yellow cube at bottom corner)\n  Step13: Move block with index 12 (orange wedge bottom left of rocket)\n  Step14: Move block with index 13 (orange wedge bottom right of rocket)\n  Step15: Move block with index 5  (green cube on second layer of rocket)\n  Step16: Move block with index 4  (blue cube on second layer of rocket)\n  Step17: Move block with index 12 (top-left rocket wedge)\n  Step18: Move block with index 13 (top-right rocket wedge)\n}\n\nFollowing the above plan (or any re‑arranged step order you prefer) will yield the two final shapes exactly as pictured, with no extra rotations needed.",

        "content": "**Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image**\n\nThe target image actually shows _two_ separate structures:\n\n1. **“Chair”‐like Structure** (left):\n   - **Layers/Count**  \n     - **Bottom Layer:** Two tall green rectangular blocks (legs).  \n     - **Second Layer:** A red cube sits atop one of the green legs; a horizontal yellow rectangular block spans across (forming the “seat”).  \n     - **Third Layer:** A blue cube sits on top of the red cube.  \n     - **Top Layer:** A yellow half‐cylinder (arch) rests on the blue cube.  \n   - **Total Blocks in Chair:** 6  \n   - **Spatial Notes:**  \n     - Two vertical green pillars side by side.  \n     - Red cube on top of the front pillar, with a yellow rectangular “seat” bridging both pillars at that same level.  \n     - Blue cube stacked above the red cube, and a curved yellow arch on top.\n\n2. **“House”‐like Structure** (right):\n   - **Layers/Count**  \n     - **Bottom Layer:** Two blue cubes side by side.  \n     - **Second Layer:** A horizontal yellow rectangular block bridging the two blue cubes.  \n     - **Third Layer:** One blue cube and one red cube side by side (forming a 2‐block span).  \n     - **Fourth Layer:** A horizontal green block bridging across those two cubes.  \n     - **Top Layer (Roof):** Two orange triangular wedges meeting in the middle to form a pitched roof.  \n   - **Total Blocks in House:** 8  \n   - **Spatial Notes:**  \n     - The base is two blue cubes.  \n     - A yellow rectangular beam spans them.  \n     - Above that is one blue and one red cube.  \n     - The next level is a green rectangular beam bridging across the red and blue cubes.  \n     - Finally, two triangular wedges (orange) create the symmetric roof peak.  \n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nBelow are the dictionary‐index matches used, _without_ re‐orienting any blocks:\n\n• For the **Chair**  \n  1. Yellow arch on top → index **9**  \n  2. Blue cube → index **1**  \n  3. Red cube → index **3**  \n  4. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (seat) → index **7**  \n  5. Two vertical green rectangular blocks (legs) → index **6** (used twice)\n\n• For the **House**  \n  1. Two bottom blue cubes → index **1** (used twice)  \n  2. Yellow horizontal rectangular block bridging them → index **7**  \n  3. One red cube + one blue cube above → indices **3** and **1** respectively  \n  4. Green horizontal rectangular block (just under the roof) → index **5**  \n  5. Two orange triangular wedges for the roof → indices **14** (left) and **15** (right)\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nA possible step‐by‐step sequence (from bottom to top, chair first, then house):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 6  (first green pillar for chair)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 6  (second green pillar for chair)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 3  (red cube onto front green pillar)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 7  (yellow seat across the two pillars)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 1  (blue cube on top of red cube)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 9  (yellow arch on top of the blue cube)  \n\n  Step7: Move block with index 1  (left blue cube at house base)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 1  (right blue cube at house base)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 7  (yellow rectangular block spanning the two blue cubes)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 1 (blue cube above the left side)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 3 (red cube above the right side)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 5 (green block bridging the red & blue cubes)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 14 (left orange wedge for roof)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 15 (right orange wedge for roof)\n}\n\nUse exactly those dictionary blocks (and multiples of them as noted) without reorienting any piece.",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\nThere are actually two separate little “structures” in the target image:\n\n1) **Left Structure**  \n   - **Layering/Count:**  \n     • Bottom layer: two small yellow rectangular prisms side by side  \n     • Above those: one red “curved‐cutout” block and, slightly behind it, one small orange “roof” piece  \n     • Above the red block: one flat green rectangular prism  \n     • Topmost layer: two blue cubes  \n\n   - **Blocks Used (7 total):**  \n     1 × red curved block  \n     2 × yellow rectangular blocks  \n     1 × green rectangular block  \n     2 × blue cubes  \n     1 × orange roof piece  \n\n   - **Spatial Notes:** The two yellow blocks form the base; the red curved block sits centered on the front yellow base block, and the orange roof sits on (or just above) the rear yellow base block. A single green plank spans the top of the red block, with two blue cubes standing side by side on that green plank.\n\n2) **Right Structure**  \n   - **Layering/Count:**  \n     • Bottom layer: two horizontal orange cylinders (the “wheels”)  \n     • Above them: a single long yellow rectangular prism bridging across  \n     • Topmost layer: a single blue cube  \n\n   - **Blocks Used (4 total):**  \n     2 × orange cylinders  \n     1 × yellow rectangular block  \n     1 × blue cube  \n\n   - **Spatial Notes:** The two orange cylinders line up in parallel on the ground. The long yellow block lies on top across them, and the single blue cube is centered on the yellow block.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Selecting Matching Blocks From the Dictionary\n\nUsing the dictionary image:\n\n- **Red Curved Block:** Index #3 (it has the curved cutout oriented forward, matching the target).  \n- **Green Flat Rectangular Block:** Index #6 (the green plank lying horizontally).  \n- **Blue Cubes:** Index #4 (use three of them total: two for the left structure’s top, one for the right structure’s top).  \n- **Orange Roof Piece:** Index #13 (the small orange “house‐roof” shape).  \n- **Yellow Rectangular Blocks:**  \n  - For the two small base blocks under the left structure: Index #8 (twice).  \n  - For the long horizontal block on the right structure: Index #9 (once).  \n- **Orange Cylinders (Wheels):** Index #11 (twice, since they lie horizontally).\n\nSummarizing all needed pieces (with exact orientations as shown in the dictionary):\n\n• #3 × 1  \n• #6 × 1  \n• #4 × 3  \n• #13 × 1  \n• #8 × 2  \n• #9 × 1  \n• #11 × 2  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Assembly Order\n\nBelow is one logical step‐by‐step sequence to place all 11 blocks.  (Steps 1–7 build the left structure; steps 8–11 build the right one.)\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 8,\n  Step2: Move block with index 8,\n  Step3: Move block with index 3,\n  Step4: Move block with index 13,\n  Step5: Move block with index 6,\n  Step6: Move block with index 4,\n  Step7: Move block with index 4,\n  Step8: Move block with index 11,\n  Step9: Move block with index 11,\n  Step10: Move block with index 9,\n  Step11: Move block with index 4\n}",

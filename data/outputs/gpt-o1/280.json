I have broken the solution into three parts per your instructions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Total Block Count:  13  \n  –  Main “double‐arch” structure uses 11 blocks  \n  –  The smaller separate arch‐and‐roof structure uses 2 blocks  \n• Layering (3 layers total):\n  1) Bottom Layer:\n     – Two red arches (forming the front of the main structure)  \n     – One red arch in the smaller separate piece  \n     – One tall green rectangular block behind the arches  \n     – Two tall yellow rectangular blocks behind the green block  \n  2) Middle Layer:\n     – One blue cube on top of the left arch  \n     – One orange cube/block on top of the right arch  \n     – Two yellow half‐cylinder pieces spanning between left and right arch  \n     – One orange roof wedge on the small separate arch  \n  3) Top Layer:\n     – Two orange roof wedges, each perched atop its tower (one over the blue cube, one over the orange cube)\n\nSpatially:\n• The two front arches sit side by side.  \n• The blue cube sits directly above the left arch; the orange cube sits above the right arch.  \n• Two yellow half‐cylinders bridge the gap between the tops of those two cubes.  \n• A tall green block and two tall yellow blocks stand behind the arches, rising up in the rear.  \n• Off to the right, a single red arch has an orange roof wedge placed on top, forming the small separate structure.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) SELECTING THE REQUIRED DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow are the blocks (by index) that match color, shape, and orientation exactly as seen in the target.  Note that some blocks appear multiple times.\n\n• Red arches (3 total):\n  – #1 (twice) – used for the left arch in the main structure and for the separate arch\n  – #2 (once) – used for the right arch in the main structure\n• Blue cube (1 total):\n  – #4\n• Orange cube/block (1 total):\n  – #5\n• Tall green rectangular block (1 total):\n  – #7\n• Tall yellow rectangular blocks (2 total):\n  – #9 (twice)\n• Yellow half‐cylinders (2 total):\n  – #12 (twice)\n• Orange wedge “roof” pieces (3 total):\n  – #15 (three times)\n\nIn total, that yields 13 blocks:  \n  #1 × 2, #2 × 1, #4 × 1, #5 × 1, #7 × 1, #9 × 2, #12 × 2, #15 × 3.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n{  \n   Step1:  Move block with index 1   (place left red arch of main structure)  \n   Step2:  Move block with index 2   (place right red arch of main structure)  \n   Step3:  Move block with index 1   (place red arch for the separate small structure)  \n   Step4:  Move block with index 7   (stand the tall green block behind the arches)  \n   Step5:  Move block with index 9   (first tall yellow block behind green)  \n   Step6:  Move block with index 9   (second tall yellow block behind green)  \n   Step7:  Move block with index 4   (place blue cube on top of left arch)  \n   Step8:  Move block with index 5   (place orange cube on top of right arch)  \n   Step9:  Move block with index 12  (first half‐cylinder bridging tops of arches)  \n   Step10: Move block with index 12  (second half‐cylinder bridging tops of arches)  \n   Step11: Move block with index 15  (roof wedge on the small separate arch)  \n   Step12: Move block with index 15  (roof wedge on top of the blue cube)  \n   Step13: Move block with index 15  (roof wedge on top of the orange cube)  \n}  \n\nFollowing these steps with the listed blocks (without rotating them further) reproduces the target scene exactly as shown.",

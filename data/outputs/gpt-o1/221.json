        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can replicate the two structures exactly as shown, using the Dictionary blocks without any re‐orientations.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN (TARGET) IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n■  Smaller “House”‐Shaped Structure  \n•  Total Blocks: 6  \n•  Layers (bottom to top):  \n   – Layer 1: Two blue cube blocks on the left and right, bridged by one yellow rectangular block in the center.  \n   – Layer 2: One red arch block sitting atop the yellow bridge.  \n   – Layer 3 (Roof): Two orange wedge blocks forming a peaked roof.  \n\n■  Larger “Tower”‐Shaped Structure  \n•  Total Blocks: 14  \n•  Layers (bottom to top):  \n   – Layer 1: One wide yellow rectangular block forming the base.  \n   – Layer 2: Four red arch blocks arranged to form a circular opening.  \n   – Layer 3: Another wide yellow rectangular block bridging across the top of the arches.  \n   – Layer 4: A tall “body” consisting of two red cubes on one side, one small blue cube in front, and one green rectangular block bridging across the top of those cubes.  \n   – Layer 5 (Roof): Four orange wedge blocks (two pairs of mirrored wedges) forming a pyramid‐shaped roof.  \n\nHence, across the two structures there are 20 blocks in total (6 for the smaller house, 14 for the tall tower).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING THE REQUIRED DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\nFrom the provided Dictionary image (blocks 1‒16), you need the following:\n\n■  For the Smaller Structure (6 blocks total):\n   – 1× #7 (blue cube, left base)  \n   – 1× #8 (blue cube, right base)  \n   – 1× #11 (yellow rectangular block for the bridge)  \n   – 1× #1 (red arch)  \n   – 1× #13 (orange wedge for left side of roof)  \n   – 1× #15 (orange wedge for right side of roof)  \n\n■  For the Larger Structure (14 blocks total):\n   – 2× #11 (two wide yellow rectangular blocks, bottom & arch‐cap)  \n   – 4× #1 (four red arches making the circular opening)  \n   – 2× #6 (two red cubes, stacked at the side)  \n   – 1× #3 (blue cube in front)  \n   – 1× #9 (green rectangular block bridging across the top)  \n   – 2× #13 (orange wedges for two corners of the roof)  \n   – 2× #15 (orange wedges for the other two corners of the roof)  \n\nAll must be used in exactly the orientation shown (no rotation beyond what is depicted in the Dictionary).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER (BOTTOM → TOP)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is one possible build sequence (enumerating each block placement).  \n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 7   (left blue cube for small house)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 8   (right blue cube for small house)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 11  (yellow bridge for small house)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 1   (red arch on the small house)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 13  (left orange wedge for small house roof)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 15  (right orange wedge for small house roof)\n\n  Step7:  Move block with index 11  (wide yellow base for the tall tower)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 1   (first red arch around tower opening)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 1   (second red arch)\n  Step10: Move block with index 1   (third red arch)\n  Step11: Move block with index 1   (fourth red arch)\n  Step12: Move block with index 11  (yellow block bridging above arches)\n  Step13: Move block with index 6   (first red cube for tower body)\n  Step14: Move block with index 6   (second red cube stacked above)\n  Step15: Move block with index 3   (blue cube in front)\n  Step16: Move block with index 9   (green rectangular block spanning the top)\n  Step17: Move block with index 13  (first orange wedge for tower roof)\n  Step18: Move block with index 13  (second orange wedge)\n  Step19: Move block with index 15  (third orange wedge)\n  Step20: Move block with index 15  (fourth orange wedge)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps (and using the designated block indices in the orientations shown in the Dictionary) will reproduce the two target structures exactly.",

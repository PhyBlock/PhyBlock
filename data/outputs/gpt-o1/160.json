        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n1.  **Total Block Count and Layers**\n\n    -  The **left “house‐shaped” structure** is made from **9** blocks arranged in **three levels**:  \n       •  **Bottom level (5 blocks):** two orange triangular wedges (left and right), two small yellow cubes, and one red arch‐shaped block with a circular hole.  \n       •  **Second level (2 blocks):** one green cube on the left and one blue cube on the right.  \n       •  **Top level (2 blocks):** two orange triangular wedges forming the peaked roof.\n\n    -  The **right “temple‐shaped” structure** is made from **5** blocks in essentially **two main levels plus a top wedge**:  \n       •  **Bottom level (1 block):** one long yellow rectangular base.  \n       •  **Middle level (3 blocks):** two vertical orange cylinders serving as columns, spanned by another long yellow rectangular block on top.  \n       •  **Top level (1 block):** a single orange wedge resting on the upper yellow beam.\n\n    In total, the scene uses **14 blocks** (9 for the left structure + 5 for the right).\n\n2.  **Spatial Relationships**\n\n    -  **Left Structure (“House”)**  \n       •  On the bottom row, the red arch block sits in the center, flanked by a small yellow cube on each side, and then an orange triangular wedge at each outer corner.  \n       •  Above the left wedge and cube sits the green cube; above the right wedge/cube side sits the blue cube.  \n       •  Two orange wedges meet at the top to form the peaked roof.\n\n    -  **Right Structure (“Temple”)**  \n       •  A single yellow rectangular prism forms the base.  \n       •  Two orange cylinders stand vertically on this base, supporting a second yellow rectangular prism on top (like a lintel).  \n       •  One orange wedge is placed on the very top as the “roof” piece.\n\n---\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks\n\nMatching each color, shape, and orientation _exactly_ (without re‐orienting beyond how they appear in the dictionary) leads to the following block‐index choices:\n\n•  **Red Arch (front‐to‐back hole):** Block **#3**  \n•  **Small Yellow Cubes:** Block **#7** (used twice)  \n•  **Long Yellow Rectangular Prisms:** Block **#8** (used twice)  \n•  **Green Cube:** Block **#6**  \n•  **Blue Cube:** Block **#5**  \n•  **Orange Cylinders (vertical):** Block **#9** (used twice)  \n•  **Orange Triangular Wedges:**  \n  -  For the bottom corners and the left‐structure roof (which needs mirrored wedges), use blocks **#15** and **#16** in pairs. In total, four wedges for the “house”: 2×#15 + 2×#16.  \n  -  For the single wedge on top of the right “temple,” use block **#14** (an orange wedge oriented as shown).\n\n### Complete List of Indices and Quantities\n\n1.  #3  (×1)  \n2.  #5  (×1)  \n3.  #6  (×1)  \n4.  #7  (×2)  \n5.  #8  (×2)  \n6.  #9  (×2)  \n7.  #14 (×1)  \n8.  #15 (×2)  \n9.  #16 (×2)\n\n---\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBelow is a possible step‐by‐step sequence, building from the ground up. (You may of course rearrange the order so long as the final stacking is the same.)\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 15   // bottom-left wedge of the house\n  Step2: Move block with index 7    // bottom-left yellow cube\n  Step3: Move block with index 3    // red arch in the house center\n  Step4: Move block with index 7    // bottom-right yellow cube\n  Step5: Move block with index 16   // bottom-right wedge of the house\n\n  Step6: Move block with index 6    // place green cube (2nd layer, left)\n  Step7: Move block with index 5    // place blue cube (2nd layer, right)\n\n  Step8: Move block with index 15   // top-left wedge of the peaked roof\n  Step9: Move block with index 16   // top-right wedge of the peaked roof\n\n  Step10: Move block with index 8   // large yellow base of the temple\n  Step11: Move block with index 9   // first orange column\n  Step12: Move block with index 9   // second orange column\n  Step13: Move block with index 8   // yellow beam across the columns\n  Step14: Move block with index 14  // small wedge on top of the temple\n}",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n1. **Overall Layout and Layers**  \n   - The model consists of **two separate sub‐structures**:\n\n     • **Left Tower**: A five‐layer vertical stack.  \n       1. Top layer: red “arched” block (large cylindrical cutout visible from the front).  \n       2. Second layer: a thin green rectangular block.  \n       3. Middle layer: two small cubes side by side—blue on the left, yellow on the right.  \n       4. Fourth layer: another thin green rectangular block.  \n       5. Bottom layer: the same red “arched” block as used at the top.  \n\n     • **Right Cradle**: Two red “half‐cylinder” blocks side by side (forming a cradle) with a single blue cube resting on top.\n\n2. **Block Count**  \n   - **Left Tower** uses 6 blocks.  \n   - **Right Cradle** uses 3 blocks.  \n   - **Total**: 9 blocks.\n\n3. **Spatial Relationships**  \n   - The red arched blocks enclose the tower top and bottom, with green rectanglular pieces sandwiched in between.  \n   - The two small colored cubes (blue and yellow) occupy the middle of the tower, side by side.  \n   - On the right side, two red half‐cylinders form a base cradle, and a blue cube sits directly on top of them.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\n- From the dictionary image, the matching pieces (in the exact orientations shown) are:\n\n  1. **Red Arched Block (#7)**  \n     • Used twice (top and bottom of the left tower).  \n     • #7 is the tall red block viewed so that its large circular cutout faces front.  \n\n  2. **Green Rectangular Block (#12)**  \n     • Used twice (the thin green “bands” in the tower).  \n     • #12 is the horizontal orientation of the green plank.  \n\n  3. **Blue Cube (#8)**  \n     • Used twice (one in the tower’s middle, one on the right cradle).  \n\n  4. **Yellow Cube (#11)**  \n     • Used once (the other cube in the tower’s middle).  \n\n  5. **Red Half‐Cylinder Blocks (#3 and #4)**  \n     • One of each to form the right‐side cradle (top surface curved upwards).\n\nHence the required indices (with repeats) are:\n• #7 (twice), #12 (twice), #8 (twice), #11 (once), #3 (once), #4 (once).\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one possible bottom‐to‐top build sequence, using each block by its dictionary index:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7   // Bottom red arch of the left tower\n  Step2: Move block with index 12  // Lower green rectangular block\n  Step3: Move block with index 8   // Blue cube (left tower middle)\n  Step4: Move block with index 11  // Yellow cube (left tower middle)\n  Step5: Move block with index 12  // Upper green rectangular block\n  Step6: Move block with index 7   // Top red arch of the left tower\n  Step7: Move block with index 3   // Left half of the red cradle (right structure)\n  Step8: Move block with index 4   // Right half of the red cradle (right structure)\n  Step9: Move block with index 8   // Blue cube on top of cradle (right structure)\n}",

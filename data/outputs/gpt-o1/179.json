        "content": "Analysis of the Target Structure\n--------------------------------\n\n1) Overall Count & Layers\n\n•  The tower at left uses a total of 10 blocks arranged in (approximately) five layers from bottom to top:\n\n   Layer 1 (bottom):\n   – 1 yellow rectangular block\n\n   Layer 2:\n   – 2 orange cylinders standing on the yellow block\n\n   Layer 3:\n   – 1 yellow rectangular block bridging across the top of the two cylinders\n\n   Layer 4:\n   – 2 blue cubes side by side\n   – 1 red arch block behind the cubes on the same level\n\n   Layer 5 (top):\n   – 1 red cube resting on top of the arch\n   – 2 orange wedge blocks forming a pitched roof\n\n•  The separate smaller structure on the right uses 3 blocks in a single layer:\n   – 1 blue cube in the center\n   – 2 orange wedges (one on each side)\n\n2) Which Dictionary Blocks Match?\n---------------------------------\n\nFrom the provided block dictionary, the following pieces (by index) match exactly in shape/color/orientation (no rotations allowed other than those shown):\n\n• Yellow rectangular blocks (for tower’s bottom and bridging piece):  #6  \n  (use two of these)\n\n• Orange cylinders: #9  \n  (use two of these)\n\n• Blue cubes: #4  \n  – two cubes for the tower  \n  – one more cube for the small side‐structure  \n  (total three #4 cubes)\n\n• Red arch (with curved opening on the underside): #1  \n  (one needed)\n\n• Red cube (the small red block that sits on top of the arch): #5  \n  (one needed)\n\n• Orange wedges (for the tower’s roof): #13 and #16  \n  – one pair (#13 + #16) for the top roof of the tower  \n\n• Orange wedges (for the small side structure): #13 and #16 again  \n  – another pair (#13 + #16) flanking the blue cube on the ground  \n\nHence in total you will use:\n– 2 × #6  \n– 2 × #9  \n– 3 × #4  \n– 1 × #1  \n– 1 × #5  \n– 2 × #13  \n– 2 × #16  \n\n3) Assembly Order\n-----------------\n\nBelow is a suggested step‐by‐step sequence.  Remember that the same index may appear multiple times if more than one identical piece is needed.\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 6   (place first yellow rectangular block as the tower’s base)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 9   (place first orange cylinder on the base)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 9   (place second orange cylinder on the base)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 6   (place second yellow rectangular block bridging over the two cylinders)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 4   (place first blue cube on top)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 4   (place second blue cube on top)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 1   (place the red arch behind/over the two blue cubes)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 5   (place the red cube on top of the arch)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 13  (place left orange wedge for the roof)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 16  (place right orange wedge for the roof)  \n\n  -- Now assemble the smaller side structure --\n\n  Step11: Move block with index 13  (place left orange wedge on the ground)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 4   (place the blue cube between the wedges)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 16  (place right orange wedge on the ground)  \n}\n\nFollowing these steps and using the indicated block indices will reproduce the target arrangement exactly as shown.",

        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how to interpret and build the two structures exactly as shown, without rotating any blocks beyond the orientations given in the dictionary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n■ Overall Count and Layers\n•  The scene consists of TWO separate sub‐structures.  \n•  Total of 13 blocks are used across both.\n\nStructure A (the “arch/house” on the left), 8 blocks total:\n  –  Bottom Layer:  \n     ➊ Two columns, each made of two blue cubes stacked (4 blue cubes total).  \n  –  Middle Layer:  \n     ➋ A short yellow rectangular block spans across the two columns.  \n     ➌ A yellow half‐cylinder sits in the center, nested under the arch.  \n  –  Top Layer:  \n     ➍ A red arch block rests above the half‐cylinder.  \n     ➎ Finally, a red triangular “roof” block on the very top.  \n\nStructure B (the “car” on the right), 5 blocks total:\n  –  Bottom Layer:  \n     ➊ Two orange cylinders laid horizontally, acting as wheels.  \n  –  Top Layer:  \n     ➋ One long yellow rectangular block bridging those two wheels.  \n     ➌ A single blue cube sitting on top of the bar (toward one side).  \n     ➍ Another yellow half‐cylinder on top of the bar (toward the other side).  \n\nIn summary:  \n•  Structure A uses 4 blue cubes, 1 red arch, 1 red roof block, 1 short yellow bar, and 1 yellow half‐cylinder.  \n•  Structure B uses 2 orange cylinders, 1 long yellow bar, 1 blue cube, and 1 yellow half‐cylinder.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFrom the block‐index image, the following matches are needed (no re‐orientations allowed):\n\n•  Blue Cube → index 3  \n  –  Used FIVE times total (4 in the left arch structure, 1 in the car).  \n\n•  Red Arch (opening facing front) → index 1  \n  –  Used ONCE (the arch atop the left structure).  \n\n•  Short Yellow Rectangular Bar (horizontal) → index 4  \n  –  Used ONCE (spanning the blue pillars in Structure A).  \n\n•  Long Yellow Rectangular Bar (horizontal) → index 5  \n  –  Used ONCE (the main “chassis” in the car).  \n\n•  Orange Cylinder (horizontal) → index 9  \n  –  Used TWICE (the two wheels under the car).  \n\n•  Yellow Half‐Cylinder (curved side up, horizontal) → index 10  \n  –  Used TWICE (one under the red arch, one on the car’s bar).  \n\n•  Red Triangular “Roof” Block → index 13  \n  –  Used ONCE (the rooftop piece above the red arch).  \n\nBlock‐Index List (with quantities in parentheses):  \n  [1], [3 × 5], [4], [5], [9 × 2], [10 × 2], [13]  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP-BY-STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one logical order for placing each piece. Feel free to group or reorder steps if desired, but these 13 moves will reproduce the target exactly:\n\n{\n Step1:  Move block with index 3   // Place 1st blue cube (left column, bottom)\n Step2:  Move block with index 3   // Stack 2nd blue cube on top of the first\n Step3:  Move block with index 3   // Place 3rd blue cube (right column, bottom)\n Step4:  Move block with index 3   // Stack 4th blue cube on top of the third\n Step5:  Move block with index 4   // Place short yellow bar bridging the two blue columns\n Step6:  Move block with index 10  // Set yellow half-cylinder on that bar, centered\n Step7:  Move block with index 1   // Put red arch on top, over the half-cylinder\n Step8:  Move block with index 13  // Add the red triangular roof on very top\n\n // Now the “car” structure:\n Step9:  Move block with index 9   // Place 1st orange cylinder horizontally (wheel)\n Step10: Move block with index 9   // Place 2nd orange cylinder horizontally (second wheel)\n Step11: Move block with index 5   // Lay long yellow bar atop the two orange wheels\n Step12: Move block with index 3   // Put the 5th blue cube on the bar (forming the “cab”)\n Step13: Move block with index 10  // Place 2nd yellow half-cylinder on the bar (rear “hood”)\n}\n\nFollowing those steps (with the indicated blocks) will exactly reproduce the two structures as shown in the main image.",

        "content": "Analysis of the Main Target Image\n---------------------------------\nFrom the picture, there are actually two separate little “structures”:\n\n• Left Structure (4 blocks total)\n  – Two orange triangular prisms forming a “tent‐like” base.  \n  – One blue cube set in the middle/behind them.  \n  – One green rectangular block bridging across the triangular prisms.  \n\n• Right Structure (10 blocks total)\n  – Four orange cylinders acting as “legs.”  \n  – Three yellow rectangular blocks on top of the cylinders forming a “seat/platform.”  \n  – One green cube stacked on the platform.  \n  – One blue cube on top of the green cube.  \n  – One yellow half‐cylinder capping it all at the top.  \n\nHence, the entire scene uses 14 blocks in total. Viewed in vertical “layers,” the right‐hand build has cylinders on the bottom layer, the rectangular seat blocks above them, then a green cube layer, a blue cube above that, and finally a yellow half‐cylinder on top. The left‐hand build is simpler—two triangular blocks on the bottom with the blue cube and green rectangular block forming the upper layer.\n\nSelecting the Required Blocks\n-----------------------------\nBelow are the dictionary indices that match each piece exactly as‐pictured (no rotation allowed other than as shown in the dictionary):\n\n• Left Structure\n  1) Blue cube → Index 1  \n  2) Green rectangular block (horizontal orientation) → Index 4  \n  3) Orange triangular prism (left side) → Index 13  \n  4) Orange triangular prism (right side) → Index 14  \n\n• Right Structure\n  1) Orange cylinders (4 total) → Index 8 (used 4 times)  \n  2) Yellow rectangular blocks for the seat (3 total) → Index 5 (used 3 times)  \n  3) Green cube → Index 2  \n  4) Blue cube → Index 1  \n  5) Yellow half‐cylinder (curved front‐to‐back) → Index 9  \n\nAssembly Order\n--------------\nA suitable step‐by‐step build sequence (bottom‐to‐top) could be:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 13    // Left orange triangle  \n  Step2: Move block with index 14    // Other orange triangle  \n  Step3: Move block with index 1     // Blue cube (left build)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 4     // Green rectangular block bridging triangles  \n\n  Step5: Move block with index 8     // 1st orange cylinder (right build)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 8     // 2nd orange cylinder  \n  Step7: Move block with index 8     // 3rd orange cylinder  \n  Step8: Move block with index 8     // 4th orange cylinder  \n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 5    // 1st yellow rectangle on top of cylinders  \n  Step10: Move block with index 5    // 2nd yellow rectangle (seat)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 5    // 3rd yellow rectangle (seat)  \n\n  Step12: Move block with index 2    // Green cube on the seat  \n  Step13: Move block with index 1    // Blue cube on the green cube  \n  Step14: Move block with index 9    // Yellow half‐cylinder capping the tower  \n}",

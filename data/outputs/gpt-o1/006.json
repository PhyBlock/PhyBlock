        "content": "Analysis of Target Structure\n1)  Total Block Count and Layers  \n   •  The model uses 7 total pieces arranged in two “tiers.”  \n   •  The bottom tier has five blocks: two tall green rectangular prisms (one left, one right), two vertical orange cylinders side‐by‐side in the center, and one orange triangular wedge on each side at floor level.  \n   •  The top tier consists of a single orange triangular wedge resting across the tops of the green blocks and cylinders.  \n\n2)  Spatial Relationships  \n   •  At floor level, the two upright green blocks flank the center.  \n   •  Between them (in the middle) sit two vertical orange cylinders, placed side by side.  \n   •  On the outer edges of each green block base is an orange triangular wedge leaning outward (left wedge on the left block, right wedge on the right block).  \n   •  A single orange triangular wedge (“roof” shape) caps the structure on top, bridging across the tops of the two green blocks and cylinders.  \n\nSelection of Dictionary Blocks\nTo match both shape and orientation _exactly_ (no re‐orientations allowed), the following blocks from the dictionary are used:\n\n •  Green Rectangular Block (tall orientation): index 3  \n    – Use two of these (left and right).  \n •  Orange Cylinder (vertical): index 6  \n    – Use two of these, side by side in the center.  \n •  Orange Triangular Wedge (left‐leaning): index 13  \n    – One copy for the left side at ground level.  \n •  Orange Triangular Wedge (right‐leaning): index 14  \n    – One copy for the right side at ground level.  \n •  Orange Triangular Wedge (front‐to‐back “roof”): index 15  \n    – One copy for the top.  \n\nAssembly Order\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 13,\n  Step2: Move block with index 14,\n  Step3: Move block with index 3,\n  Step4: Move block with index 3,\n  Step5: Move block with index 6,\n  Step6: Move block with index 6,\n  Step7: Move block with index 15\n}",

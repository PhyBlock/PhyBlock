        "content": "Below is one worked‐through “match‐up” of the finished model to the block “dictionary,” together with a suitable build‐order.  The main points to note are (1) there are two large red “arches,” one at each end, (2) four small yellow cubes around the base, (3) two green cubes in the middle layers, (4) three blue cubes on top, and (5) six orange “wedge” pieces making up the sloping sides and the peaked roof.  In total there are 17 blocks in three main vertical “layers” on the left tower and two layers on the right.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE TARGET STRUCTURE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n•  Total Block Count = 17  \n   –  2 × Red arch blocks  \n   –  4 × Yellow small cubes  \n   – 2 × Green small cubes  \n   – 3 × Blue cubes  \n   – 6 × Orange wedges\n\n•  Layers and Arrangement  \n   – Left “tower” section is three layers high:  \n       ◦  Bottom row (5 blocks): an orange wedge at each corner, a red arch in the center, and a small yellow cube on each side of the red arch.  \n       ◦  Second row (3 blocks): one orange wedge sloping up on one side, a green cube centered above the arch, and then the blue cube on top of that green.  \n       ◦  Rooftop/apex (2 orange wedges) forming the peaked top.  \n\n   – Right “platform” section is two layers high:  \n       ◦  Bottom row: one red arch block (with its circular opening), plus two yellow cubes at its corners (one clearly seen on the far right, one tucked behind).  \n       ◦  Second row: one green cube directly on top of the arch, crowned by two blue cubes.  An additional orange wedge sits behind/alongside to connect back to the left tower.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2)  MATCHING TO THE DICTIONARY (BLOCK INDICES)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is one plausible way to “map” each colored shape to the dictionary images (keeping orientation the same as shown in the dictionary):\n\n•  Red Arches → Block #1  \n  (Use 2 of #1 for the two arch pieces, since #1 is the red block with the circular hole oriented front‐to‐back.)  \n\n•  Blue Cubes → Block #4  \n  (Use 3 of #4 for the three blue cubes.)  \n\n•  Green Small Cubes → Block #5  \n  (Use 2 of #5 for the two green blocks that sit above the arches.)  \n\n•  Yellow Small Cubes → Block #6  \n  (Use 4 of #6 for the four yellow cubes in the base layer.)  \n\n•  Orange Wedges → A combination of #13, #15, and #16 (whichever ones in the dictionary show the correct “triangular wedge” faces without rotating).  \n  (Total 6 wedges.  For example, you might use three copies of #13 and three copies of #16 if those two orientations match the left‐and‐right sloping sides and the peaked roof.  The key is to pick whichever orange wedges in the dictionary have exactly the same orientation you see in the target.)\n\nHence, the needed block indices and counts are:\n\n  •  #1 × 2  \n  •  #4 × 3  \n  •  #5 × 2  \n  •  #6 × 4  \n  •  #13 × 3  (or as many as match the “left‐sloping” wedges)  \n  •  #16 × 3  (or as many as match the “right‐sloping” wedges)  \n\n(If your particular set has wedges #15 instead of #13 for one slope, simply choose the wedge indices that visually match the target’s faces.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA sample build sequence (one block per step) might look like this:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 13  (orange wedge, bottom left corner)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 6   (yellow cube, bottom row)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 1   (red arch, left tower)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 6   (yellow cube, other side of arch)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 16  (orange wedge, bottom right corner)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 13  (orange wedge sloping up one side)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 5   (green cube on arch)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 4   (blue cube on green)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 13  (one half of the orange “roof” apex)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 16  (other half of the apex)  \n\n  -- Now build out the right platform --\n\n  Step11: Move block with index 1   (second red arch)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 6   (yellow cube, base right front)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 6   (yellow cube, tucked behind arch)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 16  (orange wedge bridging to left tower)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 5   (green cube on the right arch)  \n  Step16: Move block with index 4   (first blue cube on right)  \n  Step17: Move block with index 4   (second blue cube on right)\n}\n\nAny minor re‐ordering of the wedges is fine so long as the final stacked structure matches the original.  The crucial rule is to use the blocks in exactly the orientations shown in the dictionary (no rotations other than what is pictured).",

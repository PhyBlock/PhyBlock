Bottom layer: two vertical orange cylinders.  \n    2. Top layer: one horizontal green rectangular block bridging across the two cylinders.\n\n• **Spatial Relationships:**  \n  – The two orange cylinders stand upright at the same height, spaced just far enough apart so that the green block can lie across their tops.  \n  – The green rectangular block rests horizontally on top of (and spanning) the two cylinders, forming a simple “table” shape.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\n1. **Orange Cylinders (x2)**  \n   – Both orange cylinders in the target image are vertical.  \n   – In the dictionary, the upright orange cylinder is shown at index **7**.  \n   – Hence, choose block index 7‐twice (for the left and right pillars).\n\n2. **Green Rectangular Block (x1)**  \n   – A single horizontal rectangular green block is on top.  \n   – In the dictionary, the horizontally oriented green block at index **1** matches that orientation without further rotation.  \n   – Thus, choose block index 1 for the top piece.\n\n**List of Block Indices Needed:**  \n• Two copies of index 7 (the vertical orange cylinder).  \n• One copy of index 1 (the horizontal green rectangular block).\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**  \n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 7  \n  Step2: Move block with index 7  \n  Step3: Move block with index 1  \n}  ",

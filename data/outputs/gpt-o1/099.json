Block Count and Layers  \n•  There are 9 total blocks.  \n•  They form roughly five vertical “levels”:  \n   – Level 1 (bottom): Two small blue cubes side‐by‐side.  \n   – Level 2: One long yellow rectangular bar bridging across those two cubes, plus the tall orange cylinder rising up the center.  \n   – Level 3: Two orange triangular wedges on either side of the cylinder.  \n   – Level 4: A single red “arched” block that sits around/against the top of the cylinder.  \n   – Level 5 (topmost): Two small yellow half‐cylinders (the “caps”).  \n\n2.  Spatial Relationships  \n•  The two blue cubes form the base (left and right).  \n•  The yellow bar rests across the front edges of the two cubes.  \n•  The orange cylinder stands vertically behind (or through the center of) that yellow bar.  \n•  The pair of orange wedges sit atop the yellow bar, one to the left of the cylinder and one to the right.  \n•  A red arched block is placed at the top of the cylinder.  \n•  Two small yellow half‐cylinders cap off the red block, side‐by‐side.  \n\nSelecting the Required Blocks\nBelow are the exact blocks (by index) from the dictionary that match color, shape, and orientation (no further rotation allowed):\n\n•  Two blue cubes → Block 6 (used twice).  \n•  One yellow rectangular bar → Block 7.  \n•  One tall orange cylinder (vertical) → Block 8.  \n•  Two orange triangular wedges (mirrored left/right) → Blocks 15 and 16.  \n•  One red arched block (curved front face) → Block 3.  \n•  Two small yellow half‐cylinders (lying left‐to‐right) → Block 11 (used twice).  \n\nAssembly Order\nUse the following step‐by‐step sequence (one “Move block with index …” per step):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 6\n  Step2: Move block with index 6\n  Step3: Move block with index 7\n  Step4: Move block with index 8\n  Step5: Move block with index 15\n  Step6: Move block with index 16\n  Step7: Move block with index 3\n  Step8: Move block with index 11\n  Step9: Move block with index 11\n}",

(Note that we reuse the same index for identical blocks if needed, exactly as portrayed—no rotations different from the dictionary images.)\n\n- **Red Arch**:  \n  • Index #1 (used twice; one arch per structure)\n\n- **Orange Roof Wedges**:  \n  • Index #14 (used twice; left side of each peaked roof)  \n  • Index #15 (used twice; right side of each peaked roof)\n\n- **Green Pillar**:  \n  • Index #7 (tall green rectangular prism, used once for the left structure)\n\n- **Yellow Plank**:  \n  • Index #9 (used three times total: one for the left structure, two for the right)\n\n- **Blue Cube**:  \n  • Index #4 (used twice for the right structure)\n\n- **Orange Cylinder**:  \n  • Index #10 (used twice, for the columns in the right structure)\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one possible step‐by‐step sequence placing blocks from the ground up.  Use each block in exactly the orientation shown in the dictionary (no additional rotation):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 7   // Left green pillar  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 9   // Yellow plank on the pillar (left structure)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 1   // Red arch atop the plank (left structure)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 14  // First orange wedge (left roof piece)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 15  // Second orange wedge (right roof piece)  \n\n  Step6:  Move block with index 9   // Bottom yellow plank on the right structure  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 10  // First orange cylinder  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 10  // Second orange cylinder  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 9   // Upper yellow plank on the columns  \n  Step10: Move block with index 4   // First blue cube  \n  Step11: Move block with index 4   // Second blue cube  \n  Step12: Move block with index 1   // Red arch spanning the cubes  \n  Step13: Move block with index 14  // Left wedge of the roof  \n  Step14: Move block with index 15  // Right wedge of the roof  \n}\n\nBy following the above list of blocks and this assembly order, you will recreate the two structures exactly as shown in the target image.",

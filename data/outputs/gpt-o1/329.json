        "content": "Below is one systematic way to “read off” the two pictured structures from the images and then match them block‐for‐block (including orientation) to the dictionary.  Finally, an example assembly order is given.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n●  Overall there are two separate assemblies:\n\n A)  Left‐Hand Tower/Arch Assembly\n    –  **Bottom layer:**  Three orange cylinders standing upright.  \n        - Two are side‐by‐side at the front.  \n        - A third “tall” cylinder behind them (in practice made by stacking two orange cylinder blocks).  \n    –  **Middle layer:**  Two short yellow rectangular blocks arranged at right angles to form a small “platform.”  \n    –  **On top of the platform:**  One red arch block (arch opening downward) plus one blue cube perched on the front edge.  \n    –  **Very top:**  An orange triangular “roof” piece capping the tall cylinder.\n\n B)  Right‐Hand “Window” Assembly\n    –  **Bottom:**  One yellow rectangular block laid horizontally (left to right).  \n    –  **Sides:**  Two tall green rectangular blocks, one on the left and one on the right, standing vertically.  \n    –  **Center fill:**  A red rectangular block above a blue rectangular/cube block.  \n    –  **Top:**  Another yellow rectangular block, also laid horizontally.\n\n●  Block Counts and Layers\n  –  Left assembly uses 9 total pieces:\n    (1) four orange cylinder pieces (two at the front, two stacked behind),  \n    (2) two short yellow blocks forming the “platform,”  \n    (3) one red arch block,  \n    (4) one blue cube,  \n    (5) one orange triangular roof.  \n\n  –  Right assembly uses 6 total pieces:\n    (1) two short yellow blocks (top and bottom),  \n    (2) two tall green blocks (left and right columns),  \n    (3) one red rectangular/cube block in the center (upper),  \n    (4) one blue cube in the center (lower).  \n\nTotal across both structures: 15 blocks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTION FROM THE DICTIONARY (NO RE‐ORIENTATIONS)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nUsing the numbering in your second image, the matches (with required repeats) are as follows.\n\nA)  Left‐Hand Tower/Arch Assembly\n  •  Orange Cylinders (#13) × 4  \n  •  Short Yellow “flat” block (#9) × 1  (horizontal L–R)  \n  •  Short Yellow “flat” block (#10) × 1 (front–back orientation)  \n  •  Red Arch (#1) × 1   (arch opening downward as shown)  \n  •  Blue Cube (#4) × 1  \n  •  Orange Triangular Wedge (#14) × 1  \n\nB)  Right‐Hand “Window” Assembly\n  •  Short Yellow “flat” block (#9) × 2  (both laid left–right, top & bottom)  \n  •  Tall Green Rectangular block (#6) × 1 (left column)  \n  •  Tall Green Rectangular block (#7) × 1 (right column)  \n  •  Red Small Block (#5) × 1  (center top)  \n  •  Blue Cube (#4) × 1  (center bottom)  \n\nNote that #9, #4, and #13 each appear multiple times as needed.  \n \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  EXAMPLE STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one logical order (you can of course vary the exact sequence):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 13   (front‐left cylinder)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 13   (front‐right cylinder)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 13   (rear cylinder base)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 13   (stacked above rear base)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 9    (yellow platform piece, left–right)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 10   (yellow platform piece, front–back)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 1    (red arch on top of platform)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 4    (blue cube on front edge)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 14   (orange roof wedge on top of tall cylinder)\n\n  -- Now build the right “window” --\n\n  Step10: Move block with index 9   (bottom yellow bar, left–right)\n  Step11: Move block with index 6   (green left column)\n  Step12: Move block with index 7   (green right column)\n  Step13: Move block with index 5   (red center block, upper)\n  Step14: Move block with index 4   (blue center block, lower)\n  Step15: Move block with index 9   (top yellow bar)\n}\n\nThis completes both structures exactly as shown, using only the block orientations given in the dictionary.",

        "content": "1)  MAIN‐IMAGE ANALYSIS\n\n   •  Overall there are two separate “builds.”  On the left is a tall “tower” with a red/arch base, two orange columns, and a yellow cross‐piece at both the bottom and the top, topped by a triangular (wedge) “roof.”  On the right is a smaller “house‐shaped” assembly consisting of two triangular orange wedges at the base with a vertical blue block between them, a green rectangular block across the middle, and another triangular wedge on top.\n\n   •  Counting & Layers\n       –  Left Tower:  \n          ▪  Layer 1 (bottom): one red arch flanked by two triangular wedges.  \n          ▪  Layer 2: one wide yellow rectangular block bridging across.  \n          ▪  Layer 3: two vertical orange cylinders topped by another wide yellow rectangular block.  \n          ▪  Layer 4 (top): a single triangular wedge.  \n          →  8 blocks total in this sub‐structure.\n       –  Right “House”:  \n          ▪  Layer 1 (bottom): two triangular wedges with a vertical blue block between them.  \n          ▪  Layer 2: one green rectangular block set horizontally as a “belt.”  \n          ▪  Layer 3 (top): a single triangular wedge “roof.”  \n          →  5 blocks total in this sub‐structure.\n\n   •  Spatial Relationships\n       –  The left tower’s lowest layer places one arch block in the center and two wedges on either side, all touching along their edges.  \n       –  A yellow block spans across the top of that first layer.  The two vertical cylinders stand on that block, with another identical yellow block placed over the tops of the cylinders.  \n       –  A triangular wedge then caps everything at the very top.  \n       –  The right “house” has its two wedges forming a triangular base, with a blue rectangular/cube block between them.  A green rectangular block rests horizontally across the mid‐section, and finally another triangular wedge sits on top.\n\n\n2)  REQUIRED DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n\n   To match color, shape, and orientation exactly (no re‐orienting beyond what is shown), the following dictionary‐indices are needed.  (Note that some indices are reused multiple times.)\n\n   •  Left Tower\n       1)  #15 (red/orange wedge, left foot)  \n       2)  #16 (red/orange wedge, right foot)  \n       3)  #1  (red arch, center of base)  \n       4)  #8  (yellow rectangular block, bottom cross‐piece)  \n       5)  #10 (orange cylinder, left column)  \n       6)  #10 (orange cylinder, right column)  \n       7)  #8  (yellow rectangular block, top cross‐piece)  \n       8)  #14 (red/orange wedge, roof)\n\n   •  Right “House”\n       9)   #13 (red/orange wedge, bottom left)  \n       10)  #16 (red/orange wedge, bottom right)  \n       11)  #3  (blue cube in center)  \n       12)  #6  (green rectangular block for the “belt”)  \n       13)  #14 (red/orange wedge, top “roof”)\n\n   (Total of 13 blocks, counting reused indices.)\n\n\n3)  ASSEMBLY ORDER\n\nBelow is one possible step‐by‐step sequence (using the same block indices listed above):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 15\n  Step2:  Move block with index 16\n  Step3:  Move block with index 1\n  Step4:  Move block with index 8\n  Step5:  Move block with index 10\n  Step6:  Move block with index 10\n  Step7:  Move block with index 8\n  Step8:  Move block with index 14\n  Step9:  Move block with index 13\n  Step10: Move block with index 16\n  Step11: Move block with index 3\n  Step12: Move block with index 6\n  Step13: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nFollowing the above list will yield the two‐piece structure shown in the target image.",

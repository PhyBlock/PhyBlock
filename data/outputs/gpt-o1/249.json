        "content": "Analysis of the Main Target Image  \n• Overall there are two “sub‐assemblies.”  \n  1) A tall red rectangular “ring” with a horizontal circular hole, through which a flat green block is passed.  \n  2) A “car” shape consisting of:  \n     – Two orange cylinders laid horizontally (the wheels/axles).  \n     – A yellow rectangular block resting on those cylinders (the car’s body).  \n     – A blue cube on top of the left side of the yellow block.  \n     – A yellow half‐cylinder on top of the right side of the yellow block.  \n\n• Layering and Counts  \n  – The red/green ring assembly effectively has two blocks in one layer (the green block passes through the red ring).  \n  – The car assembly has three vertical layers:  \n    1) The two orange wheels on the bottom.  \n    2) One yellow rectangular block spanning those wheels.  \n    3) A blue cube on one end of that block and a yellow half‐cylinder on the other end.  \n\nSelecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary  \nBelow is the exact block match (no rotation allowed beyond what is shown in the dictionary images):  \n• Red ring block with horizontal hole → Block index 4  \n• Green flat rectangular bar, oriented horizontally → Block index 8  \n• Blue cube → Block index 6  \n• Yellow rectangular block (short, horizontal) → Block index 11  \n• Yellow half‐cylinder, flat side down → Block index 14  \n• Orange cylinders (wheels), horizontally oriented → Block index 13 (used twice)  \n\nHence, the indices needed (with repeats as required) are:  \n(4), (8), (13), (13), (11), (6), (14).  \n\nAssembly Order  \n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4,  \n  Step2: Move block with index 8,  \n  Step3: Move block with index 13,  \n  Step4: Move block with index 13,  \n  Step5: Move block with index 11,  \n  Step6: Move block with index 6,  \n  Step7: Move block with index 14  \n}  ",

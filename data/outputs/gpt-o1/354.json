        "content": "Below is one reasonable “best‐fit” reading of the scene that uses only the block‐orientations shown in the dictionary (no additional rotations).  First comes a careful inventory of what is in the Target Image, then which Dictionary blocks match, and finally a plausible step‐by‐step build order.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DESCRIPTION OF THE TARGET STRUCTURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  Overall there are two separate sub‐structures:\n\n  A)  LEFT “TOWER” SUB‐STRUCTURE\n     –  Base/Column:  Two orange cylinders stacked vertically, forming a tall column.  \n     –  Top “Roof”:  An orange wedge‐shaped block capping the column.  \n     –  Mid‐Level Platform:  Two yellow rectangular blocks arranged horizontally around the mid‐height of the column.  One extends far enough to hold a blue cube; the other supports a red arch.  \n     –  Red Arch + Blue Cube:  At that same mid‐level, a single red arch sits over the column, and a blue cube is perched out front.\n\n  B)  RIGHT “H‐SHAPED” SUB‐STRUCTURE\n     –  Four Red Arches:  Two arches form the “legs” on the bottom layer; two more arches sit on top.  \n     –  Yellow Cross‐Bar:  Spanning the middle (left‐to‐right) between the two pairs of arches is a horizontal “band” of two yellow rectangular blocks.\n\n•  Layer Count (conceptually):\n  –  The left tower has three main vertical layers:\n       1) The two stacked cylinders (base),\n       2) The mid‐platform of yellow blocks + arch + cube,\n       3) The orange wedge on top.\n  –  The right “H” has two main layers:\n       1) Bottom pair of red arches,\n       2) Middle yellow cross‐bar + top arches.\n\n•  Total Block Count (as interpreted here):\n  –  Left Tower:  2 orange cylinders, 1 orange wedge, 1 red arch, 2 yellow rectangular blocks, 1 blue cube.\n  –  Right “H”:   4 red arches, 2 yellow rectangular blocks.\n  –  Grand Total:  13 blocks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING MATCHING BLOCKS (BY INDEX)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA)  LEFT TOWER  \n  •  Orange Cylinders (#11) × 2  \n    (Vertical cylinder as shown—no extra rotation needed.)  \n  •  Orange Wedge (#15) × 1  \n    (Matches the “roof” piece on top in the same orientation as the dictionary.)  \n  •  Red Arch (#2) × 1  \n    (Arch opening left‐to‐right, matching the main image’s orientation.)  \n  •  Yellow Rectangular Block (#8) × 2  \n    (Blocks oriented long‐side left‐to‐right, used as the mid‐level “platform.”)  \n  •  Blue Cube (#5) × 1  \n\nB)  RIGHT “H”  \n  •  Red Arch (#2) × 4  \n    (All four arches have their curved openings running left‐to‐right.)  \n  •  Yellow Rectangular Block (#8) × 2  \n    (Again, oriented with the long dimension left‐to‐right for the horizontal cross‐bar.)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  SUGGESTED ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 11   (1st orange cylinder for left tower base)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 11   (2nd orange cylinder stacked above the first)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 8    (1st yellow rectangle to form mid‐platform)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 8    (2nd yellow rectangle completing mid‐platform)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 2    (Red arch onto the yellow platform)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 5    (Blue cube onto the front extension)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 15   (Orange wedge on top of the tower)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 2    (1st red arch for the right “H” base)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 2    (2nd red arch for the right “H” base)\n  Step10: Move block with index 8    (1st yellow rectangle as the cross‐bar)\n  Step11: Move block with index 8    (2nd yellow rectangle beside it)\n  Step12: Move block with index 2    (3rd red arch on top of the “H”)\n  Step13: Move block with index 2    (4th red arch on top of the “H”)\n}\n\nThat completes a no‐rotation match to the Target Image using the indicated block‐indices from the Dictionary.",

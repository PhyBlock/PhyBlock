        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can reproduce the little “car” exactly as shown:\n\n1)  Main‐Image Analysis  \n• Block Count: There are exactly 5 blocks in total.  \n• Layers: The model is effectively 3 layers tall:  \n   – Layer 1 (bottom): Two horizontal orange cylinders side by side.  \n   – Layer 2 (middle): One short yellow rectangular block spanning the two cylinders.  \n   – Layer 3 (top): A blue cube on one end of the yellow block and a yellow half‐cylinder on the other end.  \n• Spatial Arrangement:  \n   – The two orange cylinders lie parallel to each other (their long axes horizontal).  \n   – The short yellow rectangular block sits directly on top of them.  \n   – The blue cube is placed on top of (and aligned with) the left side of that yellow block.  \n   – The yellow half‐cylinder is similarly on top of (and aligned with) the right side of the same yellow block, curved side facing up.\n\n2)  Selecting Blocks from Dictionary  \nTo match orientation, color, and shape exactly (no re‐orienting of the dictionary pieces), use:  \n• Two copies of Index 9 (orange cylinder, horizontally oriented).  \n• One copy of Index 4 (short yellow rectangular block, lying horizontally).  \n• One copy of Index 1 (blue cube).  \n• One copy of Index 11 (yellow half‐cylinder, curved side up and length horizontal).\n\n3)  Assembly Order  \nA suitable step‐by‐step sequence (using the required block indices) is:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 9\n  Step2: Move block with index 9\n  Step3: Move block with index 4\n  Step4: Move block with index 1\n  Step5: Move block with index 11\n}\n\nFollowing this order will yield the illustrated car exactly as shown in the target image.",

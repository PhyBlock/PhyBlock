        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can reproduce both of the pictured structures step by step, using only the exact blocks (and orientations) shown in the “Block Dictionary.”  The solution is in three parts:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are actually two separate builds:\n\nA) Chair‐like Structure (left side of the image)\n •  Four orange cylinder “legs,” arranged in a 2×2 grid on the floor.  \n •  A “seat” made of three yellow rectangular blocks laid flat atop the four cylinders.  \n •  A single tall green rectangular prism rising upward from the back of the seat.  \n •  A yellow half‐cylinder capping the top of that green prism (the “chair back”).  \n\nHence, this chair uses a total of 9 blocks:  \n   –  4 orange cylinders  \n   –  3 yellow rectangular blocks (for the seat)  \n   –  1 tall green rectangular block (the back)  \n   –  1 yellow half‐cylinder (the top “arch” of the back)\n\nB) House/Tower Structure (right side of the image)\n •  Bottom Layer (3 blocks):  \n      –  A green horizontal rectangular block on the left  \n      –  A red arch block in the center  \n      –  A green horizontal rectangular block on the right  \n •  Second Layer (4 blocks):  \n      –  A red triangular wedge on the far left  \n      –  A small green block next to it  \n      –  A blue cube block next to the green one  \n      –  A red triangular wedge on the far right  \n •  Top Layer (2 blocks):  \n      –  Two red triangular wedges forming the “roof” peak  \n\nThat configuration totals 9 blocks for the “house,” namely:  \n   –  2 green rectangular blocks  \n   –  1 red arch  \n   –  1 small green block  \n   –  1 blue cube  \n   –  4 red wedges (two in the second layer’s sides, two forming the roof)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS (BY DICTIONARY INDEX)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom the dictionary image (indices 1–16), the structures match up to the following pieces (in the orientations shown; no rotations allowed):\n\n● Chair‐like Structure  \n   –  #10 (Orange cylinder) × 4  \n   –  #8  (Yellow rectangular block) × 3  \n   –  #7  (Tall green rectangular prism) × 1  \n   –  #11 (Yellow half‐cylinder) × 1  \n\n● House/Tower Structure  \n   –  #6  (Green rectangular block) × 2   [for the bottom layer sides]  \n   –  #1  (Red arch) × 1                 [bottom layer center]  \n   –  #5  (Small green block) × 1        [second layer middle‐left]  \n   –  #4  (Blue cube) × 1                [second layer middle‐right]  \n   –  #14 (Red wedge) × 1                [second layer left wedge]  \n   –  #16 (Red wedge) × 1                [second layer right wedge]  \n   –  #13 (Red wedge) × 1                [top roof left‐side]  \n   –  #15 (Red wedge) × 1                [top roof right‐side]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is one possible order in which to place each block.  Use the exact block‐index each time (with duplicates for those used multiple times):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 10   (1st orange cylinder for the chair leg)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 10   (2nd orange cylinder)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 10   (3rd orange cylinder)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 10   (4th orange cylinder)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 8    (1st yellow seat block)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 8    (2nd yellow seat block)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 8    (3rd yellow seat block)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 7    (tall green back block)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 11   (yellow half‐cylinder on top)\n\n  Step10: Move block with index 6    (house base, left green block)\n  Step11: Move block with index 1    (red arch block in center of base)\n  Step12: Move block with index 6    (house base, right green block)\n  Step13: Move block with index 14   (red wedge, second layer left side)\n  Step14: Move block with index 5    (small green block, second layer middle‐left)\n  Step15: Move block with index 4    (blue cube, second layer middle‐right)\n  Step16: Move block with index 16   (red wedge, second layer right side)\n  Step17: Move block with index 13   (top roof wedge, left half)\n  Step18: Move block with index 15   (top roof wedge, right half)\n}\n\nFollowing the above list (and placing each block in the same orientation as shown in the dictionary) will recreate the two target builds exactly.",

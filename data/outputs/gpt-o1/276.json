        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can interpret and build the two structures exactly as shown, using only the orientations provided in the block‐dictionary image.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1.  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n■ Overall Count and Separation into Two Structures  \n  •  In total, there are 14 blocks used: 9 form the left “house‐like” structure and 5 form the right “ring” structure.\n\n■ Left Structure (9 blocks, stacked in 5 layers)  \n  1) Bottom Layer: Three red arch‐blocks side by side.  \n  2) Second Layer: One long yellow rectangular block bridging across the three arches.  \n  3) Third Layer:  \n     – A green cube on the left.  \n     – A blue cube in the center (same height as the green blocks).  \n     – A green cube on the right.  \n  4) Fourth Layer: One small blue cube centered on top of the middle blue piece.  \n  5) Top Layer: An orange/red wedge resting on the upper blue cube.\n\n■ Right Structure (5 blocks)  \n  • Formed by two large red “half‐ring” pieces that join to create a circular opening.  \n  • Three blue cubes pass through the center of that ring—one cube in the middle, with one on each side.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2.  SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is exactly which dictionary‐index each visible block corresponds to; note that cubes are truly cubic, so using the same index repeatedly is acceptable so long as the face‐orientation in the dictionary image matches what is shown.\n\nA) Left “House” Structure (9 blocks total):\n   • Bottom Layer (3 arches): Use block index 1 three times.  \n   • Second Layer (long yellow block): Use block index 12 once.  \n   • Third Layer (L‐to‐R: green – blue – green):  \n        – Green cubes: block index 9 (twice).  \n        – Middle blue cube: block index 10 (once).  \n   • Fourth Layer (top blue cube): block index 8 (once).  \n   • Fifth Layer (orange/red wedge): block index 15 (once).\n\nB) Right “Ring” Structure (5 blocks total):\n   • Two red half‐ring pieces: block index 5 and block index 7.  \n   • Three blue cubes spanning the ring: all block index 10 (used three times).\n\nHence the full set used is:\n   – #1 × 3  \n   – #5 × 1  \n   – #7 × 1  \n   – #8 × 1  \n   – #9 × 2  \n   – #10 × 4  \n   – #12 × 1  \n   – #15 × 1  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3.  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one logical order in which to place the blocks:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1   // left arch (bottom layer)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 1   // center arch (bottom layer)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 1   // right arch (bottom layer)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 12  // yellow rectangular block across arches\n  Step5:  Move block with index 9   // green cube on left (3rd layer)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 10  // blue cube in center (3rd layer)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 9   // green cube on right (3rd layer)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 8   // small blue cube on top (4th layer)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 15  // orange/red wedge on very top (5th layer)\n\n  Step10: Move block with index 5   // left half of the red ring (right structure)\n  Step11: Move block with index 7   // right half of the red ring\n  Step12: Move block with index 10  // center blue cube through ring\n  Step13: Move block with index 10  // left blue cube through ring\n  Step14: Move block with index 10  // right blue cube through ring\n}\n\nThat completes the two assembled figures exactly as pictured, with no additional rotations needed.",

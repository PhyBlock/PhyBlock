        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can interpret and reconstruct BOTH groupings in the target image—from the “arched tower” on the left to the “star” on the right—using only the unrotated blocks from the dictionary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Overall there are two separate assemblies:\n\n  A)  Red‐and‐Yellow Tower (left side)\n     – Layers:\n       ◦ Bottom Layer: Four red arches forming the “legs.”  \n       ◦ Middle Layer: A band of four yellow rectangular blocks bridging between those arches (front, back, left, right), plus two red cubes standing above the yellow band (serving as pillars), and one red arch bridging across the pillars.  \n       ◦ Top Layer: A single orange wedge‐shaped “roof” resting on the red arch below.  \n     – Block Count (tower):  \n       ◦ 4 red arch blocks (#1).  \n       ◦ 4 yellow rectangular blocks (#7) for the horizontal band.  \n       ◦ 2 red cubes (#3) as the short pillars.  \n       ◦ 1 red arch (#1) bridging the pillars up top.  \n       ◦ 1 orange wedge (#15) forming the triangular roof.  \n     – Spatial Note: The four arches (#1) stand at the corners; the yellow planks (#7) connect them. The pair of red cubes (#3) sits above the yellow band, and a single red arch (#1) spans across those cubes. Last, the orange wedge (#15) caps the top.\n\n  B)  Blue‐and‐Orange Star (right side)\n     – A flat, symmetric “star” with a green cube in its center, four blue rectangular bars radiating out in a cross, and four orange triangular wedges filling the corners.  \n     – Block Count (star):  \n       ◦ 1 green cube (#2) at center.  \n       ◦ 2 blue rectangular blocks (#5) for front/back arms (no rotation).  \n       ◦ 2 blue rectangular blocks (#6) for left/right arms.  \n       ◦ 4 orange wedges (#14) at the four outer corners.  \n     – Spatial Note: The green cube (#2) anchors the middle. Each blue block (#5 or #6) abuts one face of that cube, forming a “plus” shape. Around the outside corners, four orange wedges (#14) complete the star shape.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  WHICH DICTIONARY BLOCKS ARE USED (AND HOW MANY)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Red Arch (#1) — 5 total  \n  (4 for the tower’s bottom arches + 1 bridging across the two red cubes up top)\n\n• Red Cube (#3) — 2 total  \n  (the “pillars” above the yellow ring)\n\n• Yellow Rectangular (#7) — 4 total  \n  (the horizontal band around the middle of the tower)\n\n• Orange Wedge (#15) — 1 total  \n  (the triangular roof piece on the tower)\n\n• Green Cube (#2) — 1 total  \n  (center of the star)\n\n• Blue Rectangular (#5) — 2 total  \n  (the “arms” of the star front/back)\n\n• Blue Rectangular (#6) — 2 total  \n  (the “arms” of the star left/right)\n\n• Orange Wedge (#14) — 4 total  \n  (the four corner wedges of the star)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY SEQUENCE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1   (place first red arch at front‐left corner)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 1   (place second red arch at front‐right corner)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 1   (place third red arch at rear‐left corner)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 1   (place fourth red arch at rear‐right corner)\n\n  Step5:  Move block with index 7   (lay first yellow plank across arches, front side)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 7   (lay second yellow plank, back side)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 7   (lay third yellow plank, left side)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 7   (lay fourth yellow plank, right side)\n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 3   (place first red cube above the yellow ring)\n  Step10: Move block with index 3   (place second red cube next to the first)\n\n  Step11: Move block with index 1   (span a red arch across those two cubes)\n\n  Step12: Move block with index 15  (set the orange wedge‐roof on top)\n\n  -- Now build the star:\n\n  Step13: Move block with index 2   (place green cube in the center)\n\n  Step14: Move block with index 5   (attach a blue bar to the front face of the cube)\n  Step15: Move block with index 5   (attach a blue bar to the back face of the cube)\n  Step16: Move block with index 6   (attach a blue bar to the left face)\n  Step17: Move block with index 6   (attach a blue bar to the right face)\n\n  Step18: Move block with index 14  (first orange wedge at front‐left corner)\n  Step19: Move block with index 14  (second orange wedge at front‐right corner)\n  Step20: Move block with index 14  (third orange wedge at rear‐left corner)\n  Step21: Move block with index 14  (fourth orange wedge at rear‐right corner)\n}\n\nThat completes the two structures exactly as shown in the target image, using only the dictionary blocks in the orientations given.",

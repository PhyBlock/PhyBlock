        "content": "**1) Description of the Target Build**\n\nA convenient way to view the scene is as two separate little “builds.”  On the **left** is the taller “house‐like” structure, and on the **right** is a smaller block stack.  In total there are **10** pieces arranged in a few simple layers:\n\n• **Left (taller) structure** – 4 layers high  \n  – **Layer 1 (bottom):** Two red arch blocks side‐by‐side, arch‐openings facing front.  \n  – **Layer 2:** A long yellow rectangular block laid horizontally across the two arches, with one green cube perched toward the left and one blue cube perched toward the right (both at about the same height).  \n  – **Layer 3:** A single red arch block bridging over the green‐and‐blue cubes (arch facing front).  \n  – **Layer 4 (top):** One orange triangular “roof” piece resting on that upper arch.\n\n• **Right (smaller) structure** – 2 layers high  \n  – **Layer 1 (bottom):** One red arch block on the floor, again arch facing front.  \n  – **Layer 2 (top):** A blue cube and a yellow cube side‐by‐side on top of the arch.\n\nHence there are 10 blocks total:\n- 4 red arches,  \n- 1 yellow rectangular prism,  \n- 1 green cube,  \n- 2 blue cubes (one in each sub‐build),  \n- 1 yellow cube,  \n- 1 orange triangular roof piece.\n\n**2) Which Dictionary Blocks Are Used (No Rotation Beyond Their Shown Orientation)**\n\nBelow are the dictionary‐index matches (using them exactly as pictured, no re‐orientation):\n\n• **Red arches:** Block #1 (arch open to the front) used 4 times  \n• **Green cube:** Block #7 used once  \n• **Blue cube:** Block #6 used twice  \n• **Yellow rectangular (horizontal):** Block #9 used once  \n• **Yellow cube:** Block #8 used once  \n• **Orange triangular roof:** Block #14 used once  \n\n**3) Step‐by‐Step Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one possible order, building the left structure first and then the smaller right structure.  Use the blocks in the exact dictionary orientations noted above.\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1   (place first red arch, bottom left of tall structure)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1   (place second red arch, bottom right of tall structure)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 9   (set yellow rectangular block across the two arches)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 7   (green cube on left side, atop the yellow block)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 6   (blue cube on right side, atop the yellow block)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 1   (red arch over the green/blue cubes)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 14  (orange triangular roof on very top)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 1   (red arch for bottom of the smaller right structure)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 6   (blue cube on top/right of that arch)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 8  (yellow cube beside the blue cube)\n}",

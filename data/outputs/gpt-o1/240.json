        "content": "Below is one systematic way to “read off” the two pictured assemblies and match them to the block‐dictionary images without rotating or recoloring any piece.  I have broken the solution into three parts as requested.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n●  There are effectively two separate sub‐structures:\n\n  A)  The “little house” on the left (4 blocks total):\n     – Base: Two identical red arch‐blocks side by side.  \n     – Roof: Two orange wedge‐blocks meeting at the top.\n\n  B)  The taller “tower” on the right (10 blocks total):\n     – Columns (floor–level): Two orange cylinders in front plus a taller stack (3 cylinders) toward the back.  \n     – Yellow Platform: A single wide, yellow rectangular prism bridging the two front columns.  \n     – Second‐story “arch”: A red arch‐block set on the platform.  \n     – Yellow half‐circle piece behind that arch (functionally a small cylinder in yellow).  \n     – Two orange wedges as “roofs”: one atop the little arch‐and‐cylinder unit, and another on the very top of the tall rear cylinder stack.\n\n●  Layer / Count Summary:\n  – Left House: 4 pieces (2 red arches + 2 orange wedges).  \n  – Right Tower: 10 pieces (5 orange cylinders total, 1 yellow rectangular platform, 1 red arch, 1 small yellow cylinder/“half‐circle,” and 2 orange wedges).  \n  – Overall = 14 blocks, arranged in (at least) three vertical layers (ground‐level arches/cylinders, the yellow platform layer, and the red‐arch + wedge roofs above).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING THE CORRECT BLOCKS (AND THEIR INDICES) \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nFrom the reference sheet (second image), the following choice reproduces both color and orientation exactly (no rotation allowed):\n\n• Red arches → Dictionary index 1  (use three of these in total: two for the left “house,” one for the tower’s small arch).  \n• Orange cylinders (vertical) → Dictionary index 9  (use five total: two for front columns, three stacked at rear).  \n• Yellow rectangular platform → Dictionary index 8  (one wide, horizontal yellow prism).  \n• Small yellow “half‐cylinder” behind the top arch → approximated by the small yellow cylinder at index 12 (placed so that only half is visible, matching the half‐circle silhouette).  \n• Orange wedges → We need four wedges in total.  We can use index 14 and 16 (both slopes oriented “left–right”) in pairs.  Two go on the left‐house roof; the other two top out the tower’s second‐story arch and the rear cylinder stack.\n\nThus the required block‐index list (with quantities) is:\n\n• Index 1:  3 copies  \n• Index 8:  1 copy  \n• Index 9:  5 copies  \n• Index 12: 1 copy  \n• Index 14: 2 copies  \n• Index 16: 2 copies  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is one natural order in which to place them.  (You may, of course, reorder as convenient, but each step “moves” one block of a given index.)\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1   (left‐house: first red arch)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 1   (left‐house: second red arch)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 14  (left‐house: first orange wedge roof)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 16  (left‐house: second orange wedge roof)\n\n  Step5:  Move block with index 9   (tower front: left column)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 9   (tower front: right column)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 9   (tower rear: bottom cylinder)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 9   (tower rear: middle cylinder)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 9   (tower rear: top cylinder)  \n\n  Step10: Move block with index 8   (yellow bridging platform)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 1   (red arch atop the platform)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 12  (small yellow cylinder behind arch)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 14  (orange wedge roof on second‐story arch)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 16  (final orange wedge atop the tall rear column)\n}\n\nFollowing the above steps (and using the listed dictionary blocks in exactly these orientations) will recreate the target scene as shown in the first image.",

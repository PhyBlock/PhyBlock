Place both orange cylinders (index 9) side by side.  \n2. Place the two tall green blocks (index 6) on either side.  \n3. Lean each orange wedge (13 on the left, 14 on the right) against the green blocks.  \n4. Span the red arch (index 1) across the tops of the cylinders.  \n5. Finally, place the orange roof piece (index 10) on top of the arch.",

The second yellow rectangle is oriented front‐to‐back (behind/right).  Together they make an “L” shaped footprint.  \n   –  The red curved block sits directly on the front yellow block and faces outward so its curved cavity opens at the front.  \n   –  A single green rectangular block rests on top of the red curved block, running left‐to‐right.  \n   –  Finally, two blue cubes sit side by side on top of that green block, forming the highest layer.  \n\n2)  Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the exact color/shape/orientation in the dictionary images (no re‐orientations allowed), the needed blocks and their indices are:\n\n•  Yellow rectangular block (horizontal, left‐to‐right) → Index 14  \n•  Yellow rectangular block (horizontal, front‐to‐back) → Index 16  \n•  Red curved block (curved opening facing front) → Index 3  \n•  Green rectangular block (horizontal, left‐to‐right) → Index 11  \n•  Blue cube (used twice) → Index 8 (×2)  \n\n3)  Assembly Order\n\nBelow is one suitable step‐by‐step assembly sequence:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 14  \n  Step2: Move block with index 16  \n  Step3: Move block with index 3  \n  Step4: Move block with index 11  \n  Step5: Move block with index 8  \n  Step6: Move block with index 8\n}",

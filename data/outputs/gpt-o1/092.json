Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\n   • Total Blocks & Layers  \n     – The structure uses 5 total blocks.  \n       1) Two tall green rectangular prisms (forming the legs)  \n       2) One long yellow rectangular prism (the “seat” or top bar)  \n       3) One vertical orange cylinder (the “backrest post”)  \n       4) One yellow half‐cylinder (the “cap” on top)  \n     – There are effectively 4 layers:  \n       Layer 1: Green legs  \n       Layer 2: Yellow rectangular bar  \n       Layer 3: Orange cylinder  \n       Layer 4: Yellow half‐cylinder  \n\n   • Spatial Arrangement  \n     – Two green blocks stand vertically and support the bar.  \n     – A single yellow rectangular bar spans horizontally across the two legs.  \n     – The orange cylinder stands upright on top of that bar.  \n     – A yellow half‐cylinder sits on top of the orange cylinder, aligned so that its curved edge faces front‐to‐back.\n\n2.  Selecting Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\n   • Green Legs: Use block index 2 (tall green prism oriented vertically) twice.  \n   • Yellow Bar: Use block index 6 (yellow rectangular prism oriented horizontally).  \n   • Orange Cylinder: Use block index 10 (cylinder standing vertically).  \n   • Yellow Half‐Cylinder: Use block index 12 (half‐cylinder oriented so its curved face goes front‐to‐back when placed on top).\n\n3.  Assembly Order\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step assembly. Note that each step “moves” one block into place:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2\n  Step2: Move block with index 2\n  Step3: Move block with index 6\n  Step4: Move block with index 10\n  Step5: Move block with index 12\n}",

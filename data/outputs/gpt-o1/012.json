We cannot rotate any of them ourselves, so each piece must be used exactly as‐pictured:\n\n•  Green Center  \n   – Use block #2 (the green cube) for the middle.  \n\n•  Four Blue Arms  \n   – Use block #7 for each of the four blue arms.  \n     (All are the same blue cube in the same orientation as depicted in index #7.)  \n\n•  Four Orange Wedges  \n   – Use blocks #13, #14, #15, and #16 (the four orange wedges, each in its own orientation).  \n     These four together yield the “four‐way” wedge arrangement seen in the target.  \n\nHence your final block list and their dictionary indices:\n   { 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16 }\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‑BY‑STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nUse the following sequence (one possible order) to build the structure from the ground up:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2   // Place the green cube at center\n   Step2: Move block with index 7   // First blue arm\n   Step3: Move block with index 7   // Second blue arm\n   Step4: Move block with index 7   // Third blue arm\n   Step5: Move block with index 7   // Fourth blue arm\n   Step6: Move block with index 13  // First orange wedge\n   Step7: Move block with index 14  // Second orange wedge\n   Step8: Move block with index 15  // Third orange wedge\n   Step9: Move block with index 16  // Fourth orange wedge\n}\n\nFollowing these steps (and using **each block exactly as pictured** in the dictionary) reproduces the target arrangement shown in the first image.",

        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can arrive at (and build) the pictured shape:\n\n1)  DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE TARGET IMAGE  \n•  Total Block Count: 9 blocks  \n   – 1 green block in the very center/top.  \n   – 4 blue blocks arranged around that green block (forming a “plus” when viewed from above).  \n   – 4 orange wedge‐shaped blocks, each leaning outward against one of the blue blocks.  \n•  Layering: Essentially two “levels.”  \n   – Top Layer: The green block plus the 4 blue blocks (all their top faces come to the same height).  \n   – Below/Outward Layer: The 4 orange wedges slope down from the edges of the blue blocks to the ground.  \n•  Spatial Relationships:  \n   – The green block sits in the center, touching all four blue blocks.  \n   – Each blue block stands upright (top face horizontal) and touches one side of the central green block, forming a cross/plus shape around it.  \n   – Each orange wedge is placed against an outer face of one of the blue blocks, slanting outwards to the floor.  \n\n2)  SELECTING THE DICTIONARY BLOCKS  \n•  Green Center Block: Must be the green cube in the same orientation as shown in the dictionary → Block index 2.  \n•  Four Blue Upright Blocks: All appear as cubes with their top faces horizontal → Block index 1 used four times (all are the same orientation).  \n•  Four Orange “Lean‐Out” Wedges: In the dictionary, the orange wedges #13, #14, #15, and #16 are each the same basic wedge but oriented differently. To get one wedge leaning out on each of the four sides (front/back/left/right) without rotating them yourself, you need one of each index.  \n\nHence, the required blocks are:  \n•  (1) Green:    index 2  \n•  (4) Blue:     index 1 (repeated four times)  \n•  (4) Orange:   indexes 13, 14, 15, and 16 (one each)  \n\n3)  ASSEMBLY ORDER (EXAMPLE)  \nA straightforward way is to place the four blue columns to form a plus, add the green top, and then attach wedges around the outside.  In the required JSON‐style format:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1,\n  Step2: Move block with index 1,\n  Step3: Move block with index 1,\n  Step4: Move block with index 1,\n  Step5: Move block with index 2,\n  Step6: Move block with index 13,\n  Step7: Move block with index 14,\n  Step8: Move block with index 15,\n  Step9: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nThis sequence ensures the plus‐shaped top is built first (blue+green), then each orange wedge is added in turn.",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\nThere are two separate “models” in the target photo.  The left‐hand model looks like a simple “chair” (four orange cylinder‐legs supporting a yellow seat, with a tall green back and a curved yellow top).  The right‐hand model looks like a little “figure” (yellow half‐cylinder “feet,” a green–blue base, a yellow “belt,” a red arched body, a green band around its “shoulders,” and an orange triangular top).\n\n- **Left Model (“Chair”)**  \n  - **Block Count & Layers**  \n    1) **Layer 1**: Four orange cylinders serving as legs.  \n    2) **Layer 2**: Two yellow rectangular prisms side‐by‐side (forming the seat).  \n    3) **Layer 3**: One tall green rectangular block standing vertically on the seat.  \n    4) **Layer 4**: One yellow half‐cylinder resting on top of the green block.  \n    → Total of 8 blocks for the chair.  \n\n- **Right Model (“Figure”)**  \n  - **Block Count & Layers**  \n    1) **Layer 1**: One small green cube (left), one blue cube (right), plus two yellow half‐cylinders in front (the “feet”).  \n    2) **Layer 2**: One long yellow rectangular prism spanning the width (the “belt”).  \n    3) **Layer 3**: One tall red “arch” block.  \n    4) **Layer 4**: One short green rectangular block on top (the “band”).  \n    5) **Layer 5**: One orange triangular wedge at the very top.  \n    → Total of 8 blocks for the figure.  \n\nOverall, the two models together use **16 blocks** in five or fewer layers each.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Selection of Required Blocks\n\nBelow are the exact dictionary‐block indices needed (re‐using some indices multiple times as allowed):\n\n- **Left Model**  \n  • Four orange cylinders → **Index 12** (used 4 ×)  \n  • Two yellow rectangular prisms (seat) → **Index 9** (used 2 ×)  \n  • One tall green rectangular prism (back) → **Index 6** (1 ×)  \n  • One yellow half‐cylinder (top) → **Index 13** (1 ×)\n\n- **Right Model**  \n  • One green cube → **Index 4**  \n  • One blue cube → **Index 3**  \n  • Two yellow half‐cylinders (feet) → **Index 13** (used 2 ×)  \n  • One long yellow rectangular prism (belt) → **Index 9**  \n  • One red arch block → **Index 2**  \n  • One short green rectangular block (band) → **Index 5**  \n  • One orange triangular wedge (top) → **Index 16**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Assembly Order\n\nA possible step‐by‐step build sequence (bottom‐to‐top, first the chair, then the figure):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 12  (1st orange cylinder for chair’s leg)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 12  (2nd orange cylinder)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 12  (3rd orange cylinder)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 12  (4th orange cylinder)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 9   (1st yellow seat‐block)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 9   (2nd yellow seat‐block)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 6   (tall green block for back)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 13  (yellow half‐cylinder on top)  \n\n  Step9: Move block with index 4   (green cube for figure’s lower left)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 3  (blue cube for figure’s lower right)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 13 (1st yellow half‐cylinder foot)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 13 (2nd yellow half‐cylinder foot)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 9  (yellow rectangular “belt”)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 2  (red arch block for body)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 5  (green rectangular band)  \n  Step16: Move block with index 16 (orange wedge at the top)\n}\n\nFollowing this plan (using each piece in the orientation shown in the dictionary, without further rotation) will reproduce the target structures exactly.",

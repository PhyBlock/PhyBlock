        "content": "**Analysis of the Target Structure**\n\n• **Block Count and Layers**  \n  The model uses _five_ total blocks arranged in four vertical “layers”:  \n  1. Bottom layer: two red quarter‐arc pieces side by side.  \n  2. Second layer: one blue cube centered above the red arcs.  \n  3. Third layer: one green rectangular “bar” on top of the blue cube.  \n  4. Top layer: one orange wedge resting on the green bar.  \n\n• **Spatial Relationships**  \n  – The two red arcs touch each other at their flat sides, forming a cradle shape with their curves facing upward.  \n  – The blue cube sits directly on the center of those arcs (so the arcs together form its footing).  \n  – A horizontal green bar spans left‐to‐right on top of the cube.  \n  – The orange wedge is placed on top of the green bar, forming a roof‐like peak.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks**\n\nFrom the dictionary image, the exact matches (including orientation) are:\n\n1. **Red quarter‐arc** (index 1) → _used twice_ for the base.  \n2. **Blue cube** (index 4) → for the middle cube.  \n3. **Green rectangular bar** (index 7) → for the horizontal green piece.  \n4. **Orange wedge** (index 16) → for the roof‐shaped top.\n\nHence the needed block indices (with no rotations allowed) are:  \n• 1, 1, 4, 7, 16  \n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step instructions (the “move” order), referring to each block by its dictionary index:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 1\n  Step3: Move block with index 4\n  Step4: Move block with index 7\n  Step5: Move block with index 16\n}",

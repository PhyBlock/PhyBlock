Centered on this beam is a vertical orange cylinder, which is finally topped by a half‐cylinder in yellow.  \n\n---\n\n**Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nFrom the block‐dictionary image, the needed blocks (with exact orientation) are:\n\n- **Left Tower:**  \n  • Green base → Index 1 (short, horizontal green block)  \n  • Orange cylinder (vertical) → Index 8  \n  • Orange roof → Index 12  \n\n- **Right Tower:**  \n  • Two tall green pillars → Index 2 (used twice)  \n  • Yellow horizontal beam → Index 4  \n  • Orange cylinder (vertical) → Index 8 (used again)  \n  • Yellow half‐cylindrical cap → Index 10  \n\n**List of Block Indices Needed:**  \n{1, 2, 2, 4, 8, 8, 10, 12}\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one possible step‐by‐step sequence:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 8  \n  Step3: Move block with index 12  \n  Step4: Move block with index 2  \n  Step5: Move block with index 2  \n  Step6: Move block with index 4  \n  Step7: Move block with index 8  \n  Step8: Move block with index 10  \n}",

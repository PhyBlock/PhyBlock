Placed together, they form the round opening.  \n2) Green Sides: Use block #9 on the left and block #10 on the right (both are tall green rectangles oriented exactly as shown).  \n3) Top and Bottom Yellow “Slabs”: Use block #13 for the top and block #14 for the bottom (both are thin yellow rectangles oriented horizontally as in the dictionary).  \n\nAssembly Order\n\n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 14  // place yellow bottom  \n  Step2: Move block with index 9   // left green block  \n  Step3: Move block with index 10  // right green block  \n  Step4: Move block with index 6   // left half of red ring  \n  Step5: Move block with index 5   // right half of red ring  \n  Step6: Move block with index 13  // place yellow top  \n}  ",

        "content": "■ Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n1) Overall Count and Layering\n\nThe model naturally divides into two “groups” of blocks (a left group and a right group).  In total there are 16 blocks used, arranged in multiple layers:\n\n• Left Group (9 blocks total)\n  – Bottom Layer: 3 red arches side‐by‐side.  \n  – Second Layer (resting on the arches): one blue cube, one yellow half‐cylinder, and one orange cube.  \n  – Behind/Above those cubes (forming the “third layer”): one tall green rectangular block flanked by two tall yellow rectangular blocks.\n\n• Right Group (7 blocks total)\n  – Bottom Layer: 2 red arches side‐by‐side.  \n  – Second Layer: a wide yellow rectangular block spanning across the two arches.  \n  – Third Layer: another red arch set on top of that wide yellow block.  \n  – Fourth Layer: a narrower yellow rectangular block inserted through (or bridging) the red arch.  \n  – Top Layer: two orange triangular wedges (mirrored) forming a “roof.”\n\n2) Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nMatching each shape, color, and orientation exactly (without rotating any dictionary blocks), the following indices are used:\n\n• Red Arches (index 1) – 6 total  \n• Blue Cube (index 6) – 1 total  \n• Orange Cube (index 7) – 1 total  \n• Green Tall Rectangular Block (index 8) – 1 total  \n• Narrow Yellow Rectangular Block (index 9) – 1 total  \n• Tall Yellow Rectangular Block (index 11) – 2 total  \n• Wide Yellow Rectangular Block (index 13) – 1 total  \n• Yellow Half‐Cylinder (index 14) – 1 total  \n• Orange Triangular Wedge, left‐leaning (index 15) – 1 total  \n• Orange Triangular Wedge, right‐leaning (index 16) – 1 total  \n\n3) Step‐by‐Step Assembly Order\n\nBelow is one possible build sequence.  Use the indicated block indices in exactly that order:\n\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1 (red arch) for left-group base, left side\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1 (red arch) for left-group base, center\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1 (red arch) for left-group base, right side\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6 (blue cube) on top of left arch\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14 (yellow half-cylinder) on top of center arch\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7 (orange cube) on top of right arch\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 8 (green tall block) behind the half-cylinder\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11 (tall yellow block) behind/next to green block\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11 (tall yellow block) behind/next to green block (other side)\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1 (red arch) for right-group base, left side\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 1 (red arch) for right-group base, right side\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 13 (wide yellow rectangle) bridging those two arches\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 1 (red arch) on top of the wide yellow rectangle\",\n  \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 9 (narrow yellow rectangle) through the top arch\",\n  \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 15 (orange wedge) as left half of roof\",\n  \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 16 (orange wedge) as right half of roof\"\n}",

        "content": "Analysis of the Target Image\n\nThere are two separate “towers” or assemblies in the target picture.  The left‐hand tower uses seven pieces arranged in (roughly) six layers; the right‐hand tower uses nine pieces in about eight layers.  In total there are sixteen blocks.\n\n• Left Tower (7 blocks):\n  1)  Bottom layer is a flat yellow rectangular block.  \n  2)  Above it is a red block with a large circular hole through its center.  \n  3)  Another flat yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the red piece.  \n  4)  Two tall green rectangular columns stand vertically, side by side, on that yellow block.  \n  5)  A third yellow rectangular block rests horizontally atop the two green columns.  \n  6)  Finally, an orange “roof‐wedge” sits at the very top.\n\n• Right Tower (9 blocks):\n  1)  The base is a green rectangular block laid flat.  \n  2)  An orange cylinder (standing upright) is placed on that green base.  \n  3)  A yellow rectangular block bridges across, forming the bottom crosspiece of a “square ring.”  \n  4)  Two tall green rectangular blocks stand vertically to form the left and right sides of this ring.  \n  5)  Another yellow rectangular block completes the top crosspiece of the ring.  \n  6)  An orange wedge (triangular block) is tucked inside that ring.  \n  7)  A second green rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the ring.  \n  8)  Finally, a small blue cube caps off the very top.\n\nBlocks Needed (by Dictionary Index)\n\nBelow are the dictionary indices that match exactly (same color, shape, and orientation) as shown in the target.  The same index can be repeated as many times as needed.\n\n• For the Left Tower (7 pieces):\n  –  #7 (Yellow rectangular block) used 3 times  \n  –  #1 (Red block with circular hole) used 1 time  \n  –  #5 (Green tall rectangular column) used 2 times  \n  –  #16 (Orange wedge/“roof”) used 1 time  \n\n• For the Right Tower (9 pieces):\n  –  #4 (Green rectangular block, horizontal) used 2 times  \n  –  #10 (Orange upright cylinder) used 1 time  \n  –  #7 (Yellow rectangular block) used 2 times  \n  –  #5 (Green tall rectangular column) used 2 times  \n  –  #14 (Orange wedge block) used 1 time  \n  –  #3 (Blue cube) used 1 time  \n\nStep‐by‐Step Assembly Order\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 7       (Left tower, bottom yellow)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 1       (Red hole block on left tower)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 7       (Middle yellow on left tower)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 5       (Left green column on left tower)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 5       (Right green column on left tower)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 7       (Top yellow on left tower)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 16      (Orange roof wedge on left tower)\n\n  Step8:  Move block with index 4       (Green base on right tower)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 10      (Orange cylinder on right tower)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 7       (Bottom yellow crosspiece of ring)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 5       (Left green column of ring)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 5       (Right green column of ring)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 7       (Top yellow crosspiece of ring)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 14      (Orange wedge inside ring)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 4       (Green block on top of ring)  \n  Step16: Move block with index 3       (Blue cube at the very top)\n}",

In the JSON‐like format requested:\n\n{\n  Step1:  \"Move block with index 8\"  ,\n  Step2:  \"Move block with index 10\" ,\n  Step3:  \"Move block with index 10\" ,\n  Step4:  \"Move block with index 8\"  ,\n  Step5:  \"Move block with index 1\"  ,\n  Step6:  \"Move block with index 5\"  ,\n  Step7:  \"Move block with index 16\" ,\n\n  Step8:  \"Move block with index 1\"  ,\n  Step9:  \"Move block with index 1\"  ,\n  Step10: \"Move block with index 14\" ,\n  Step11: \"Move block with index 14\" ,\n  Step12: \"Move block with index 14\" ,\n  Step13: \"Move block with index 11\" ,\n  Step14: \"Move block with index 11\" ,\n  Step15: \"Move block with index 6\"  ,\n  Step16: \"Move block with index 6\"  ,\n  Step17: \"Move block with index 3\"  ,\n  Step18: \"Move block with index 9\"  ,\n  Step19: \"Move block with index 9\"\n}",

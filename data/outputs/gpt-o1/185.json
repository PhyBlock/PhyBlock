Four orange cylinder “columns” on the ground.  \n    2. Three yellow rectangular “planks” forming a platform.  \n    3. A tall green rectangular block.  \n    4. A blue cube.  \n    5. A yellow half‐cylinder on top.  \n  – On the left side, there are two layers:\n    1. Three red arch‐shaped blocks side by side along the ground.  \n    2. Three green cubes on top of the red arches.\n\n• Spatial Relationships  \n  – Left “Bench”:\n    • Three red blocks form a row.  The first two are arches showing from the front; the third is an arch turned so that the curved opening is hidden from front view.  \n    • Three green cubes sit directly atop those red blocks.  \n  – Right “Table and Tower”:\n    • Four orange cylinders stand in a square arrangement.  \n    • Three yellow planks span across the tops of these orange cylinders, creating a flat deck.  \n    • Centered on this deck is one tall green rectangular block, with a blue cube on top, and finally a yellow half‐cylinder capping the very top.\n\n2)  Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nNeeded block indices (with exact orientations as shown):  \n• Red arches:  \n  – #1 (twice) for the two arches showing from the front.  \n  – #2 (once) for the arch turned sideways.  \n• Green cubes (3×): #5  \n• Tall green rectangular block (1×): #7  \n• Blue cube (1×): #4  \n• Orange cylinders (4×): #11  \n• Yellow rectangular planks (3×): #9  \n• Yellow half‐cylinder (1×): #13  \n\n3)  Assembly Order\n\n{  \n  Step1:  Move block with index 1,  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 1,  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 2,  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 5,  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 5,  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 5,  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 11,  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 11,  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 11,  \n  Step10: Move block with index 11,  \n  Step11: Move block with index 9,  \n  Step12: Move block with index 9,  \n  Step13: Move block with index 9,  \n  Step14: Move block with index 7,  \n  Step15: Move block with index 4,  \n  Step16: Move block with index 13  \n}",

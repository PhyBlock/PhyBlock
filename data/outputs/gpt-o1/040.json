        "content": "1)  Description of the Target Structure\n\n•  Block Count and Layers  \n  The model uses exactly four blocks in a single “layer.”  Two tall red halves come together around the outside to form a vertical ring (with a circular hole visible from the front), and inside that ring sit one blue cube and one green cube, intersecting at the center.\n\n•  Spatial Arrangement  \n  – The two red ring‐halves are joined side‐by‐side vertically, creating a single tall rectangular frame whose center is a circular opening.  \n  – The blue cube sits in the middle of that circular opening.  \n  – The green cube also sits in the same horizontal plane, touching the blue cube so that the two cubes form a cross shape when viewed from above.  \n\n2)  Selecting the Required Blocks\n\nFrom the dictionary image, you need:\n\n•  Red ring‐half #7  \n•  Red ring‐half #8  \n•  Blue cube #9  \n•  Green cube #10  \n\nThese blocks match the colors, shapes, and (crucially) the same orientations required by the target image.  \n\n3)  Assembly Order\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step sequence (you may of course place them in a slightly different order, but here is one logical approach):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7  \n  Step2: Move block with index 8  \n  Step3: Move block with index 9  \n  Step4: Move block with index 10  \n}",

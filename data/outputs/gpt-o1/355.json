        "content": "Below is a systematic breakdown of how the target model is built and which blocks (by index) match each piece.  The final section shows a reasonable step‐by‐step order in which you could assemble them.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1.  DESCRIPTION OF THE TARGET STRUCTURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Overall Count and Layers\n  – There are 20 total blocks arranged into two main “sections”:  \n    – Left Section: 8 blocks in five layers (counting from the bottom up).  \n    – Right Section: 12 blocks in (effectively) three layers plus a few tall uprights.\n\n• Left Section (8 blocks)\n  1) Bottom Layer: Two red arches (side by side).  \n  2) Second Layer: One horizontal yellow plank bridging across the two arches.  \n  3) Third Layer: Three blocks across—green cube on the left, tall blue rectangular block in the center, green cube on the right.  \n  4) Fourth Layer: A single small blue cube placed on top (center).  \n  5) Fifth/Top Layer: An orange triangular “roof” wedge resting on the blue cube.\n\n• Right Section (12 blocks)\n  1) Bottom Layer: Three red arches lined up.  \n  2) Second Layer: One horizontal yellow plank bridging those three arches.  \n  3) Upper Pieces (placed on or just above the yellow plank):\n     – One small blue cube toward the left  \n     – Two yellow half‐cylinders (side by side)  \n     – Two tall vertical yellow blocks standing at or near center/back  \n     – One short green rectangular block, one tall green rectangular block (behind or beside the others)  \n     – One orange cube on the right side.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2.  SELECTING THE DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMatching each visible block exactly (shape, color, and orientation) yields the following indices from your dictionary:\n\n• Red arches (front‐facing): index 1  \n  – 5 total arches needed (2 on the left section, 3 on the right)  \n\n• Horizontal yellow rectangular plank: index 10  \n  – 2 total (one bridging the 2 arches on the left, one bridging the 3 arches on the right)  \n\n• Green cubes: index 4  \n  – 2 total (both are the small green cubes in the middle layer on the left)  \n\n• Tall blue rectangular block (vertical): index 7  \n  – 1 total (center of the left section’s third layer)  \n\n• Small blue cubes: index 3  \n  – 2 total (one at the top of the left section, one on the right section)  \n\n• Orange wedge (the “roof” piece): index 16  \n  – 1 total (very top of the left section)  \n\n• Yellow half‐cylinders: index 13  \n  – 2 total (front row of curved pieces on the right section)  \n\n• Tall yellow rectangular blocks (vertical): index 11  \n  – 2 total (the two tall upright yellow columns on the right)  \n\n• Short green rectangular block: index 8  \n  – 1 total (right section, smaller green rectangular piece)  \n\n• Tall green rectangular block: index 9  \n  – 1 total (right section, taller green block near the orange cube)  \n\n• Orange cube: index 5  \n  – 1 total (right section, on top/right)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3.  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA simple bottom‐to‐top build order follows.  Use the exact block indices listed:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1   (first red arch, left section)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 1   (second red arch, left section)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 10  (yellow plank bridging those two arches)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 4   (left green cube on third layer)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 7   (tall blue rectangle in center)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 4   (right green cube on third layer)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 3   (blue cube on top)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 16  (orange wedge roof)\n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 1   (first red arch, right section)\n  Step10: Move block with index 1   (second red arch, right section)\n  Step11: Move block with index 1   (third red arch, right section)\n  Step12: Move block with index 10  (yellow plank across those three arches)\n  Step13: Move block with index 3   (blue cube on left side of plank)\n  Step14: Move block with index 13  (first yellow half‐cylinder)\n  Step15: Move block with index 13  (second yellow half‐cylinder)\n  Step16: Move block with index 11  (first tall yellow upright)\n  Step17: Move block with index 11  (second tall yellow upright)\n  Step18: Move block with index 8   (short green rectangular block)\n  Step19: Move block with index 9   (tall green rectangular block)\n  Step20: Move block with index 5   (orange cube on the right)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps (or any other systematic bottom‐to‐top approach) will reproduce the target structure exactly as shown.",

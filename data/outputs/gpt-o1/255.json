Note that the order of left vs. right assembly is arbitrary:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7   (front half-ring for left assembly)\n  Step2: Move block with index 8   (back half-ring for left assembly)\n  Step3: Move block with index 9   (blue cube for left assembly)\n  Step4: Move block with index 10  (green cube for left assembly)\n\n  Step5: Move block with index 7   (front half-ring for right assembly)\n  Step6: Move block with index 8   (back half-ring for right assembly)\n  Step7: Move block with index 9   (first blue cube for right assembly)\n  Step8: Move block with index 9   (second blue cube for right assembly)\n  Step9: Move block with index 9   (third blue cube for right assembly)\n}\n```\n\nPlacing #7 and #8 together forms each red ring, and then the cubes (#9 and/or #10) are inserted through the hole.",

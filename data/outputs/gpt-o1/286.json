Bottom layer: two blue cubes (forming “pillars”).  \n    2. Second layer: one yellow rectangular block bridging across those two pillars.  \n    3. Third layer: one red arch block sitting on the yellow rectangle.  \n    4. Top layer (roof): a single orange wedge‐shaped block.  \n  – **Spatial Relationships:**  \n    – The two blue cubes are side by side with a gap spanned by the yellow block.  \n    – The red arch is centered on top of that yellow piece.  \n    – The orange wedge (roof) rests on top of the arch.\n\n• **Right (Car‐like) Structure**  \n  – **Layers & Block Count:**  \n    1. Base layer: one yellow rectangular “platform” plus two orange cylinders (the “wheels”) underneath.  \n    2. Top layer: one blue cube and one red cube side by side toward the rear of the platform.  \n  – **Spatial Relationships:**  \n    – The rectangular base is supported by the two cylinders.  \n    – The blue and red cubes sit on top at the back edge of the yellow base.\n\nAltogether, there are 10 visible blocks: 5 for the “house” and 5 for the “car.”  \n\n---\n\n**Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nTo match color, shape, and orientation **exactly** (no re‐orienting allowed), one can use:\n\n- **Blue cube:** Index 2 (used three times total: two for the house pillars, one for the car top).  \n- **Yellow rectangular block:** Index 8 (used twice total: one for the house “bridge,” one for the car base).  \n- **Red arch block:** Index 1 (used once, for the house).  \n- **Orange wedge block:** Index 13 (used once, as the house roof).  \n- **Orange cylinder:** Index 11 (used twice, as the car’s two wheels).  \n- **Red cube:** Index 5 (used once, for the car’s top).\n\nHence the needed indices (with repetitions) are:  \n1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 8, 8, 11, 11, 13.\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one reasonable step‐by‐step sequence in the required JSON‐like format.  (You may of course assemble them in a slightly different order if desired.)\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 2   // first blue cube (house pillar)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 2   // second blue cube (house pillar)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 8   // yellow rectangle spanning the two blue pillars\n  Step4:  Move block with index 1   // red arch on top\n  Step5:  Move block with index 13  // orange wedge (roof)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 8   // yellow rectangle (car base)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 11  // first orange cylinder (car wheel)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 11  // second orange cylinder (car wheel)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 2   // blue cube on car base\n  Step10: Move block with index 5   // red cube on car base\n}",

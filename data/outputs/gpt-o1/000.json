Block Count and Layers  \n• The model uses exactly five blocks in three vertical “layers.”  \n  – Bottom Layer: A single red arch block.  \n  – Middle Layer: Two side‐by‐side cubes (one blue, one red).  \n  – Top Layer: An orange triangular “roof” on top of the blue cube, and a yellow half‐cylinder on top of the red cube.  \n\n2. Spatial Arrangement  \n• The red arch sits on the ground with its opening facing forward.  \n• Directly above the arch is the blue cube, centered on the arch’s top surface.  \n• Behind (or to the rear of) the arch is a red cube, sitting level with the blue cube.  \n• On top of the blue cube is an orange triangular prism (roof‐shaped).  \n• On top of the red cube is a yellow half‐cylinder oriented so that its curved side faces left and right.  \n\nSelection of Dictionary Blocks  \n• Red arch (front‐facing opening): index 2  \n• Blue cube: index 5  \n• Red cube: index 6  \n• Yellow half‐cylinder (axis front‐to‐back): index 8  \n• Orange triangular roof block (ridge front‐to‐back): index 14  \n\nAssembly Order  \n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 2  \n  Step2: Move block with index 5  \n  Step3: Move block with index 6  \n  Step4: Move block with index 8  \n  Step5: Move block with index 14  \n}  ",

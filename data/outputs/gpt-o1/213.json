        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can “read” the target picture and match it, block‐by‐block and layer‐by‐layer, to the unrotated pieces in the dictionary.  I have broken the scene into two sub‐assemblies (“the truck” on the left and “the tower” on the right) and then listed all needed blocks and a suggested order of assembly.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA. The “Truck” (Left Structure)\n • Total Blocks: 8  \n • Layers (from bottom to top):\n   Layer 1:  \n     – Two orange cylinders (the “wheels”).  \n   Layer 2:  \n     – A single flat yellow rectangular prism forming the truck’s base.  \n   Layer 3:  \n     – Three blocks side by side: a short green rectangular block, a blue cube, and a red cube.  \n   Layer 4:  \n     – Two yellow half‐cylinders sitting on top (one over the green block, one over the red cube).\n\nB. The “Tower” (Right Structure)\n • Total Blocks: 10\n • Layers (from bottom to top):\n   Layer 1:  \n     – Two tall orange cylinders in front (pillars)  \n     – Two more tall orange cylinders stacked in the rear (making a single tall column).  \n   Layer 2:  \n     – A yellow rectangular prism laid horizontally across the two front pillars.  \n   Layer 3:  \n     – A red arch on top of that yellow prism (toward the front).  \n     – A yellow half‐cylinder behind the arch.  \n     – A red cube behind/next to that half‐cylinder.  \n   Layer 4:  \n     – One orange wedge piece on top of the red cube.  \n     – Another orange wedge piece capping the very tall orange column at the back.\n\nHence the entire scene uses 8 blocks on the truck and 10 on the tower, for a total of 18 blocks spread over roughly four layers in each sub‐assembly.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) DICTIONARY‐BLOCK SELECTION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow are all the dictionary indices needed, with how many times each occurs and where:\n\nA. Truck (8 blocks)\n • 2× #9  (orange short cylinders) – the two wheels  \n • 1× #7  (yellow flat rectangular prism) – the truck’s base  \n • 1× #5  (green rectangular block) – left/top cargo section  \n • 1× #2  (blue cube) – center top  \n • 1× #4  (red cube) – right top  \n • 2× #10 (yellow half‐cylinders) – “domed” roof pieces\n\nB. Tower (10 blocks)\n • 4× #8  (orange tall cylinders) – two front pillars + the double‐stacked rear column  \n • 1× #7  (yellow flat rectangular prism) – horizontal “bridge” across pillars  \n • 1× #1  (red arch) – on top of the yellow bridge  \n • 1× #10 (yellow half‐cylinder) – sitting behind/above the arch  \n • 1× #4  (red cube) – just behind the half‐cylinder  \n • 1× #15 (orange wedge) – roof piece on top of the red cube  \n • 1× #16 (orange wedge) – spire atop the tall rear column\n\nNote that the same part‐number may appear multiple times (e.g. #8 is used four times).  All blocks must be used exactly as shown (no further rotating).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) SUGGESTED ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nHere is one logical, layer‐by‐layer sequence.  You may of course group steps differently as long as the final arrangement matches:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 9   (first truck wheel)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 9   (second truck wheel)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 7   (truck’s long yellow base)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 5   (green rectangular block on base)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 2   (blue cube next to green)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 4   (red cube next to blue)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 10  (half‐cylinder atop the green block)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 10  (half‐cylinder atop the red cube)\n\n  -- now the tower --\n  Step9:  Move block with index 8   (front left tall cylinder)\n  Step10: Move block with index 8   (front right tall cylinder)\n  Step11: Move block with index 8   (rear column bottom)\n  Step12: Move block with index 8   (rear column top)\n  Step13: Move block with index 7   (yellow rectangular bridge on front pillars)\n  Step14: Move block with index 1   (red arch on bridge)\n  Step15: Move block with index 10  (yellow half‐cylinder behind arch)\n  Step16: Move block with index 4   (red cube behind half‐cylinder)\n  Step17: Move block with index 15  (orange wedge roof piece atop red cube)\n  Step18: Move block with index 16  (final orange wedge/spire atop the tall rear column)\n}\n\nFollowing these eighteen steps with the exact blocks (and orientations) listed will reproduce the target scene as shown.",

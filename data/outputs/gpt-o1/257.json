Bottom layer: two horizontal cylinders (“wheels”).  \n    2. Second layer: one long yellow rectangular block (“car body”).  \n    3. Third layer: one blue cube.  \n    4. Top layer: one small orange “roof” block.  \n  - **Right “H”‐Shaped Structure (4 layers):**  \n    1. Bottom layer: two red arch blocks side by side.  \n    2. Second layer: one long yellow rectangular block bridging those arches.  \n    3. Third layer: two more red arch blocks on top of the yellow block.  \n    4. Top layer: another long yellow rectangular block bridging the two upper arches.  \n\n**2) Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nMatching each block by shape, color, and orientation (without re‐orienting them):\n\n- **Red Arches:** Block #1 (arch opening on the underside). Needed 4 times (2 for the bottom of the “H” and 2 for the top).  \n- **Yellow Rectangular Beams:** Block #9 (long horizontal rectangle). Needed 3 times (1 for the left “car,” 2 for bridging the arches).  \n- **Blue Cube:** Block #6 (for the vertical blue piece). Needed 1 time.  \n- **Orange Cylinders:** Block #12 (horizontal cylinder). Needed 2 times (the “wheels”).  \n- **Orange Roof:** Block #14 (small pentagonal roof). Needed 1 time.  \n\n**List of Block Indices Used:**  \n1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 9, 9, 9, 12, 12, 14  \n\n**3) Assembly Order**\n\nA suitable step‐by‐step build sequence (from bottom to top) could be:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 12  \n  Step2: Move block with index 12  \n  Step3: Move block with index 9  \n  Step4: Move block with index 6  \n  Step5: Move block with index 14  \n  Step6: Move block with index 1  \n  Step7: Move block with index 1  \n  Step8: Move block with index 9  \n  Step9: Move block with index 1  \n  Step10: Move block with index 1  \n  Step11: Move block with index 9  \n}",

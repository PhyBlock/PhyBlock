## Steps to Complete the Task:
1.	Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:
      -	Count & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.
      -	Spatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).
2.	Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:
      -	Identify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.
      -	List Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.
      -	Matching Criteria:
      -	The chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.
      -	Important: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.
      -	The same block index may be used multiple times if needed.
      -	Example: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionaryâ€”not the vertical one.
3.	Determine the Assembly Order:
      -	Inference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence. Also pay attention to the order of building blocks, you need to start from the basic level.
      -	Output Format: Previously defined actions must be used. Use the following template for your instructions:
        Next plan: ...
4.    Note the actions that have been executed:
      -     In the execution action, all actions that have been executed will be attached with feedback related to the action execution.
      -     For example: **Execution failed** represents execution failure; **Execution successful** represents execution success.

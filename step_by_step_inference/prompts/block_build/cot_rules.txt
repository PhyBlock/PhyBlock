## Task Rules:
1. You can only use the actions I specified and the identification ID in the block dictionary image.
2. Let's think step by step. You should output rationales and the next plan. For example, Rationale: ...; Next plan: ...
3. The format of the Next plan should strictly follow the example in the format of the output planning
4. Only need to perform a single plan each time, do not output the complete plan. This means that you can only use one object at a time. For example, Next plan: Move(3). 
5. You need to note that Executed Plan includes all the plans you have executed. Please do not repeat the previous step if the previous step failed to execute!
6. Please note that the block you select must be consistent with the target image in color and posture. Please do not select the same block but in a different posture!

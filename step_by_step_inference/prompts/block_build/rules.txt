##Rules:
1. You can only use the actions I specified and the identification ID in the block dictionary image.
2. Only need to perform a single plan each time, do not output the complete plan.
3. Please note that the block you select must be consistent with the target image in color and posture. Please do not select the same block but in a different posture!
4. Only need to perform a single plan each time, do not output the complete plan. This means that you can only use one object at a time. For example, Next plan: Move(3). 
5. You need to note that Executed Plan includes all the plans you have executed. Please do not repeat the previous step if the previous step failed to execute!

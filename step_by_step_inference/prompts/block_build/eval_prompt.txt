Review the generated plan based on the given goal image using the additive 5-point scoring system described below. Points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each criterion:

- Add 1 point if the plan includes relevant steps and some logical actions toward the task, even if incomplete or containing some unnecessary steps.
- Add another point if the plan addresses a substantial portion of the task, covering most key actions, but does not fully resolve or optimize the task execution.
- Award a third point if the plan completes the basic steps of the task, clearly achieving the task's goal, but may lack precision or efficiency in some parts.
- Grant a fourth point if the plan is well-organized, clear, and covers the task comprehensively. The steps are ordered logically, and the task is completed smoothly with only minor improvements possible.
- Bestow a fifth point for a plan that is perfectly tailored to the instruction, with no unnecessary or missing steps. It reflects expert-level reasoning and demonstrates high-quality, precise task execution.

    "instruction": "<|image_pad|><|image_pad|>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

    "predict": "### Analysis of the Main Target Image:\n1. **Count & Layers**: The structure consists of 16 blocks in total, arranged in a 4x4 grid.\n2. **Spatial Relationships**: The structure is composed of two main parts:\n   - The base layer is a 4x4 grid of red blocks.\n   - The top layer consists of orange blocks placed on top of the red blocks, forming a smaller 2x2 grid.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n- **Red Blocks**: The base layer is made up of red blocks. The red blocks in the dictionary are:\n  - Index 1: Red block in a horizontal orientation.\n  - Index 2: Red block in a vertical orientation.\n  - Index 3: Red block in a diagonal orientation.\n  - Index 4: Red block in a diagonal orientation.\n- **Orange Blocks**: The top layer is made up of orange blocks. The orange blocks in the dictionary are:\n  - Index 5: Orange block in a horizontal orientation.\n  - Index 6: Orange block in a vertical orientation.\n  - Index 7: Orange block in a diagonal orientation.\n  - Index 8: Orange block in a diagonal orientation.\n\n### Assembly Instructions:\n1. **Base Layer (Red Blocks)**:\n   - Place block with index 1 in the bottom-left corner.\n   - Place block with index 2 in the bottom-right corner.\n   - Place block with index 3 in the top-left corner.\n   - Place block with index 4 in the top-right corner.\n   - Continue placing the remaining red blocks in a 4x4 grid.\n\n2. **Top Layer (Orange Blocks)**:\n   - Place block with index 5 in the center of the top-left 2x2 grid.\n   - Place block with index 6 in the center of the top-right 2x2 grid.\n   - Place block with index 7 in the center of the bottom-left 2x2 grid.\n   - Place block with index 8 in the center of the bottom-right 2x2 grid.\n\n### Final Assembly Instructions:\n```json\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 5\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block"

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to determine the construction steps:\n\nMain Target Image Analysis:\nThis structure appears to be a sort of tower with multiple components:\n\n1. The base: A green rectangular block\n2. Above that: An orange cylindrical column\n3. A frame structure made of:\n   - Two vertical green rectangular blocks on the sides\n   - Yellow horizontal blocks on top and bottom of the frame\n   - An orange triangular block at the bottom inside the frame\n4. On top of the frame:\n   - A green rectangular block\n   - A blue rectangular block\n   - An orange triangular roof\n\nLet me count the total number of blocks and layers:\n- Total blocks: approximately 10-11 blocks\n- Layers: The structure has about 6-7 distinct vertical layers\n\nNow, looking at the block dictionary to match each component:\n\nBlock Dictionary:\n1. Blue small rectangular block (horizontal)\n2. Blue small rectangular block (vertical)\n3. Green horizontal rectangular block\n4. Green vertical rectangular block\n5. Green horizontal rectangular block (appears wider than #3)\n6. Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n7. Yellow vertical rectangular block\n8. Yellow vertical rectangular block (appears similar to #7)\n9. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (appears similar to #6)\n10. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (appears similar to #6 and #9)\n11. Orange cylindrical block\n12. Orange rectangular block\n13. Orange triangular block (oriented in one direction)\n14. Orange triangular block (oriented in another direction)\n15. Orange triangular block (oriented in yet another direction)\n16. Orange triangular block (oriented in fourth direction)\n\nNow let me match each component of the main structure with blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Base: Green horizontal rectangular block (#3)\n2. Column: Orange cylindrical block (#11)\n3. Frame sides: Green vertical rectangular blocks (#4) - need two of these\n4. Frame top and bottom: Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (#6, #9, or #10) - need two of these\n5. Triangle inside frame: Orange triangular block (looks like #13, but need to check orientation)\n6. Block above frame: Green horizontal rectangular block (#5)\n7. Blue block on top: Blue vertical rectangular block (#2)\n8. Roof: Orange triangular block (looks like #13 or similar, need to check orientation)\n\nLet me check the orientation of the triangular blocks to make precise matches:\n- The triangle at the roof appears to be #13\n- The triangle in the frame appears to be #13 as well\n\nLet me now determine the assembly order from bottom to top:",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\n## Structure Overview:\nThe target structure is a tower-like construction with multiple parts and layers. It consists of:\n- A foundation made of a green rectangular block\n- An orange cylindrical column\n- A frame structure with green sides and yellow top/bottom\n- A \"house\" on top with blue walls and an orange triangular roof\n\n## Block Count and Layers:\n- Total blocks: 11 distinct building blocks\n- Layers: The structure has 7 vertical layers\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- Base layer: Green horizontal rectangular block with orange cylinder on top\n- Middle section: Frame made of two vertical green blocks connected by yellow horizontal blocks at top and bottom, with an orange triangular block at the bottom inside the frame\n- Top section: Green horizontal block supporting a blue rectangular block topped with orange triangular roof\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n- Block #3 (green horizontal rectangle) - 1 piece for the base\n- Block #11 (orange cylinder) - 1 piece for the column\n- Block #4 (green vertical rectangle) - 2 pieces for the frame sides\n- Block #10 (yellow horizontal rectangle) - 2 pieces for the frame top and bottom\n- Block #13 (orange triangular block) - 2 pieces for the roof and inside the frame\n- Block #5 (green horizontal rectangle) - 1 piece for above the frame\n- Block #2 (blue vertical rectangle) - 1 piece for top house walls\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly begins with the foundation, followed by the column, then the frame structure (sides, bottom, triangle, top), and finally the top section with the house.",

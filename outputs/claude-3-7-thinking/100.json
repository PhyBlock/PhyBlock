      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to complete this task.\n\n### 1. Main Target Image Analysis:\nThe target structure appears to be a simple house or birdhouse-like structure with:\n- A green rectangular block as the base/pillar (vertical orientation)\n- A yellow horizontal rectangular block on top of the green one (serving as a platform)\n- A red house-shaped structure with an arched doorway on top of the yellow platform\n- An orange triangular roof on top of the red structure\n\n### Number of layers: 4 layers total\n1. Bottom layer: Green vertical block\n2. Second layer: Yellow horizontal platform\n3. Third layer: Red house structure with arch\n4. Top layer: Orange triangular roof\n\n### 2. Block Dictionary Analysis:\nLet me identify the blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\nFor the green vertical block (base): Looks like block #3 or #4 (vertical green rectangular blocks)\nFor the yellow horizontal platform: Looks like block #7, #10, or #11 (horizontal yellow rectangular blocks)\nFor the red house structure with arch: Looks like block #1 (red structure with arch)\nFor the orange triangular roof: Possibly block #14, #15, or #16 (orange triangular pieces)\n\nLooking more closely:\n- The green vertical block appears to be block #3 or #4 (they look very similar)\n- The yellow horizontal platform is block #7 (horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n- The red house structure with arch is block #1\n- The orange triangular roof appears to be block #15\n\n### 3. Assembly Order:\nSince this is a structure built from bottom to top, the logical assembly order would be:\n\n1. Place the green vertical block (base)\n2. Place the yellow horizontal platform on top\n3. Place the red house structure on the platform\n4. Place the orange triangular roof on top\n\nLet's confirm my selections and provide the final answer.\n\nFor the base (green vertical block): Looking at block #3 vs #4, they appear very similar, but #3 seems to match the proportions in the target image better.\nFor the yellow platform: Block #7 matches the horizontal orientation needed.\nFor the red house structure: Block #1 has the arch front that matches the target.\nFor the orange roof: Looking at blocks #14, #15, and #16 - block #15 appears to match the orientation in the target image best.\n\nSo my final selection is:\n- Block #3 (green vertical block)\n- Block #7 (yellow horizontal platform)\n- Block #1 (red arched house structure)\n- Block #15 (orange triangular roof)\n\nNow I'll format the assembly instructions as required.",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\nI can see a structure that resembles a small house or birdhouse with multiple components arranged vertically. The structure has:\n\n- 4 distinct blocks total\n- 4 layers in height\n- From bottom to top:\n  1. A green vertical rectangular block serving as a pillar/support\n  2. A yellow horizontal rectangular block functioning as a platform/base\n  3. A red house-shaped structure with an arched opening at the front\n  4. An orange triangular roof piece on top\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The green block stands vertically on the ground\n- The yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across the top of the green block\n- The red house structure sits centered on the yellow platform\n- The orange triangular roof sits on top of the red structure\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nAfter examining the block dictionary, I need the following blocks:\n\n- Block #3: Green vertical rectangular block (for the base pillar)\n- Block #7: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (for the platform)\n- Block #1: Red house-shaped structure with arched opening (for the house body)\n- Block #15: Orange triangular roof piece (for the top)\n\nThese blocks match the exact shapes, colors, and orientations needed for the target structure.\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 15\n}",

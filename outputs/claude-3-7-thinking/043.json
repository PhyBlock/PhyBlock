      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images provided:\n\n1. Main Target Image:\nThe main target image shows a structure that consists of:\n- A central red block with a circular hole through it\n- A yellow rectangular block on top of the red block\n- A yellow rectangular block at the bottom of the red block\n\nLooking more closely at the red block with the hole, I can see that it appears to be made up of multiple parts that together form a structure with a circular passage through it.\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image:\nThe dictionary shows 14 different blocks:\n- Blocks 1-8 are red pieces, some of which appear to be parts that could form a circular hole when combined\n- Blocks 9-14 are yellow rectangular pieces in different orientations\n\nLet me analyze the target structure in more detail:\n\nThe central red part with the hole seems to be made of 4 red blocks that together form a circle. Looking at the red blocks in the dictionary, I need to identify which ones would create this circular opening when arranged together.\n\nThe yellow parts are horizontal rectangular blocks, one positioned above the red blocks and one below.\n\nNow, let's identify the specific blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\nFor the central red structure with the circular hole:\n- Looking at blocks 1-8, I need to identify which combination of 4 blocks would create the circular opening when arranged in a square formation\n- The blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4 appear to be corners or segments that could form a circle when arranged properly\n- Looking at the orientation, blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4 seem to match what we need for the four quadrants of the circular opening\n\nFor the yellow horizontal blocks:\n- Looking at blocks 9, 10, 13, and 14, these are all horizontal yellow rectangular blocks\n- Blocks 9 and 10 appear to be the same as blocks 13 and 14, just from different angles\n- Based on the orientation in the target image, blocks 9 and 13 seem to be a better match\n\nNow, let me determine the assembly order:\n\n1. We would likely start with the bottom yellow block\n2. Then add the 4 red blocks to form the circular structure\n3. Finally top it with the upper yellow block\n\nLet me finalize the blocks needed and the assembly order.",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Target Structure\n\n## Structure Description\nThe target image shows a structure with 6 building blocks arranged in 3 layers:\n- Bottom layer: 1 horizontal yellow rectangular block\n- Middle layer: 4 red blocks arranged to form a square with a circular hole through it\n- Top layer: 1 horizontal yellow rectangular block\n\nThe structure resembles a frame or portal with yellow caps on top and bottom and a circular opening through the middle red section.\n\n## Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nLooking at the block dictionary, I need to select:\n\n1. For the yellow horizontal blocks (top and bottom):\n   - Block 9 appears to be the appropriate horizontal yellow rectangular block\n\n2. For the red middle section with circular hole:\n   - Block 1: Red block with circular cutout (top-left quadrant)\n   - Block 2: Red block with circular cutout (top-right quadrant)\n   - Block 3: Red block with circular cutout (bottom-left quadrant)\n   - Block 4: Red block with circular cutout (bottom-right quadrant)\n\nThese four red blocks (1, 2, 3, 4) together form a square with a circular hole through the middle.\n\n## Required Block Indices\n- 2 × Block 9 (yellow horizontal blocks)\n- 1 × Block 1 (red block, top-left)\n- 1 × Block 2 (red block, top-right)\n- 1 × Block 3 (red block, bottom-left)\n- 1 × Block 4 (red block, bottom-right)\n\n## Assembly Instructions\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence places the bottom yellow block first, then builds the red section with the circular opening by placing all four quadrant pieces, and finally caps the structure with the top yellow block.",

The Block Dictionary Image shows 16 different building blocks with indices 1-16:\n   - 1: Red arch block\n   - 2: Red curved block\n   - 3: Blue cube\n   - 4: Green cube\n   - 5: Blue small rectangular block (standing vertically)\n   - 6: Blue rectangular block (standing vertically)\n   - 7: Green horizontal rectangular block\n   - 8: Green vertical rectangular block\n   - 9: Orange cylindrical block\n   - 10: Orange thin rectangular block\n   - 11-16: Various orange triangular/roof-shaped blocks in different orientations\n\n2. The Main Target Image shows two structures:\n   - Structure on the left: Appears to be a house-like structure with a red arch, green and blue blocks, and orange roof pieces\n   - Structure on the right: Appears to be a cross-shaped structure with blue blocks forming a cross, orange blocks as triangular extensions, and an orange cylindrical tower topped with a triangular roof\n\nLet me analyze each structure in detail:\n\nLeft Structure (House-like):\n- Base layer: Green horizontal blocks (appears to be block #7)\n- Middle layer: Red arch block (block #1) in front, with blue and green blocks on sides\n- Top layer: Blue and green cubes with orange triangular roof pieces\n\nRight Structure (Cross-shaped):\n- Base: Blue blocks forming a cross pattern\n- Middle: Orange cylindrical block (block #9) in the center\n- Top: Orange triangular roof piece\n- Extensions: Orange triangular pieces extending from the blue cross\n\nNow let me identify the exact blocks needed and the assembly order for each structure.",

Main Target Image Analysis\n\nThe image contains two distinct structures:\n\n### Left Structure (House-like):\n- **Total Blocks**: Approximately 10 blocks\n- **Layers**: 3 layers\n- **Spatial Arrangement**:\n  * Bottom layer: Three green horizontal blocks forming a base\n  * Middle layer: A red arch block in the front, with blue and green cube blocks behind\n  * Top layer: Orange triangular roof pieces\n\n### Right Structure (Cross/Windmill):\n- **Total Blocks**: Approximately 10 blocks\n- **Layers**: 3 layers\n- **Spatial Arrangement**:\n  * Base layer: Blue blocks forming a cross/plus shape\n  * Middle layer: Orange cylindrical tower in the center\n  * Top layer: Orange triangular roof on top of the cylinder\n  * Extensions: Orange triangular/slope pieces extending outward\n\n## 2. Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\n### For Left Structure:\n- Green horizontal blocks (#7) - for the base\n- Red arch block (#1) - for the middle front\n- Blue cube (#3) - for the middle back\n- Green cube (#4) - for the side\n- Orange triangular roof pieces (#11, #12, #15) - for the roof\n\n### For Right Structure:\n- Blue blocks (#3, #5, #6) - for the cross base\n- Orange cylinder (#9) - for the central tower\n- Orange triangular roof (#11) - for the top of the tower\n- Orange triangular/slope pieces (#13, #14, #15, #16) - for the extensions\n\n## 3. Assembly Instructions\n\n### Left Structure:\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 7\nStep2: Move block with index 7\nStep3: Move block with index 7\nStep4: Move block with index 1\nStep5: Move block with index 3\nStep6: Move block with index 4\nStep7: Move block with index 11\nStep8: Move block with index 11\nStep9: Move block with index 15\n```\n\n### Right Structure:\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 3\nStep2: Move block with index 5\nStep3: Move block with index 6\nStep4: Move block with index 3\nStep5: Move block with index 9\nStep6: Move block with index 11\nStep7: Move block with index 13\nStep8: Move block with index 14\nStep9: Move block with index 15\nStep10: Move block with index 16\n```\n\nThese instructions provide a logical bottom-up assembly order for both structures using the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary without rotation.",

      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and then select the appropriate blocks from the block dictionary to construct the structure.\n\nLet's analyze the main target image first:\n- There appear to be two identical structures in the image (one on the left and one on the right)\n- Each structure appears to be a house-like construction with multiple layers/levels\n\nFor each structure, I can see:\n1. Bottom layer: Two blue cubic blocks (supporting the structure)\n2. Middle layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block (like a platform)\n3. Top layer: A house-like construction made of:\n   - A red cubic block and a blue cubic block side by side\n   - A green horizontal rectangular block on top of the red and blue blocks\n   - An orange triangular roof on top\n\nLet me count the total blocks for one structure:\n- 2 blue cubic blocks (bottom)\n- 1 yellow horizontal rectangular block (middle)\n- 1 red cubic block (top house)\n- 1 blue cubic block (top house)\n- 1 green horizontal rectangular block (top house)\n- 1 orange triangular roof (top house)\n\nThat's 7 blocks per structure.\n\nNow let me identify the required blocks from the dictionary:\n\nFor the blue cubic blocks (bottom and one in house): Blocks #1, #4, #5, or #6 appear to be blue cubes. I need to select the most appropriate ones based on orientation.\n\nFor the yellow horizontal rectangular block: Blocks #9 or #11 look like yellow horizontal rectangles.\n\nFor the red cubic block: Block #3 appears to be a red cube.\n\nFor the green horizontal rectangular block: Block #7 or #8 appear to be green rectangles, with different orientations.\n\nFor the orange triangular roof: One of blocks #13, #14, #15, or #16 would be the orange triangular roof, depending on orientation.\n\nLet me finalize the selections:\n1. Bottom blue cubes: Block #1 or #4 (they look similar)\n2. Middle yellow horizontal rectangle: Block #9 or #11 (appears to be #11)\n3. Top red cube: Block #3\n4. Top blue cube: Block #1 or #4 (they look similar)\n5. Top green horizontal rectangle: Block #8 (horizontal orientation)\n6. Top orange triangular roof: Based on orientation, appears to be Block #14\n\nLet me think about the assembly order:\n1. Start with the bottom blue cubes as the foundation\n2. Place the yellow horizontal rectangle on top\n3. Place the red and blue cubes side by side on top of the yellow rectangle\n4. Place the green horizontal rectangle on top of the red and blue cubes\n5. Place the orange triangular roof on top of the green rectangle\n\nSo for one structure, the assembly order would be:\nStep 1: Move block with index 1 (blue cube)\nStep 2: Move block with index 1 (blue cube)\nStep 3: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal rectangle)\nStep 4: Move block with index 3 (red cube)\nStep 5: Move block with index 1 (blue cube)\nStep 6: Move block with index 8 (green horizontal rectangle)\nStep 7: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)",

Each structure consists of:\n- 7 blocks total\n- 3 distinct layers\n\n## Spatial Relationships\nEach structure has the following arrangement (from bottom to top):\n1. Bottom layer: Two blue cubic blocks side by side, serving as the base/foundation\n2. Middle layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block placed across the two blue blocks\n3. Top layer (house structure):\n   - A red cubic block and a blue cubic block placed side by side on the yellow platform\n   - A green horizontal rectangular block placed on top of both cubes\n   - An orange triangular roof piece on top of the green block\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n- Blue cube (Block #1): Used 3 times (2 at bottom, 1 in house structure)\n- Red cube (Block #3): Used once in house structure\n- Green horizontal rectangle (Block #8): Used once for house structure\n- Yellow horizontal rectangle (Block #11): Used once as middle platform\n- Orange triangular roof (Block #14): Used once for the roof\n\n# Assembly Order\n\nFor one structure:\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 1\nStep3: Move block with index 11\nStep4: Move block with index 3\nStep5: Move block with index 1\nStep6: Move block with index 8\nStep7: Move block with index 14\n```",

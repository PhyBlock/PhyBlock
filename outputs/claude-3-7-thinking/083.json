      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images carefully to understand what structure needs to be built and which blocks are needed.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the main target image (the first image):\n\nThis shows a small house-like structure with different colored blocks:\n- The bottom layer appears to have a yellow square/cube block on the left side and a red square/cube block on the right side\n- The middle layer has a horizontal green rectangular block spanning across the top of both bottom blocks\n- The top layer has orange/reddish triangular pieces that form a roof\n\nNow, let me analyze the block dictionary (the second image) to identify the required blocks:\n\nBlock 1: Green cube\nBlock 2: Red cube\nBlock 3: Yellow cube\nBlock 4: Green horizontal rectangle (wider than tall)\nBlock 5: Green horizontal rectangle (appears thinner than block 4)\nBlock 6: Green vertical rectangle (taller than wide)\nBlock 7: Green vertical rectangle (appears similar to block 6)\nBlock 8: Green horizontal rectangle (appears similar to block 5)\nBlock 9: Orange/red triangular piece (thin, vertical orientation)\nBlock 10: Orange/red rectangular piece\nBlock 11: Orange/red triangular piece (thin, vertical orientation, similar to block 9)\nBlock 12: Orange/red cube\nBlock 13: Orange/red triangular prism (angled downward)\nBlock 14: Orange/red triangular prism (angled upward)\nBlock 15: Orange/red triangular prism (angled to the right)\nBlock 16: Orange/red triangular prism (angled to the left)\n\nNow, to determine which blocks from the dictionary match the target structure:\n\nBottom layer:\n- Left side: Yellow cube = Block 3\n- Right side: Red cube = Block 2\n\nMiddle layer:\n- Horizontal green rectangle spanning across = Block 4 (it looks wider than blocks 5 or 8)\n\nTop layer (roof):\n- The roof appears to be made of triangular pieces\n- Looking at the orientation, I believe it uses Block 14 on the left side and Block 16 on the right side\n\nSo the blocks needed are:\n- Block 2 (red cube)\n- Block 3 (yellow cube) \n- Block 4 (wide green rectangle)\n- Block 14 (orange triangular prism angled upward)\n- Block 16 (orange triangular prism angled to the left)\n\nNow for the assembly order, I need to build from bottom to top:\n\n1. Place the bottom layer blocks (Block 3 and Block 2)\n2. Place the middle layer (Block 4)\n3. Place the roof pieces (Block 14 and Block 16)\n\nLet me format this according to the template:",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\nThe main target image shows a small house-like structure consisting of multiple building blocks arranged in three distinct layers:\n\n1. **Bottom Layer**: Two cube-shaped blocks side by side - a yellow cube on the left and a red cube on the right\n2. **Middle Layer**: A horizontal green rectangular block placed across the top of both bottom cubes\n3. **Top Layer**: Two orange triangular prism blocks forming a roof structure\n\nTotal blocks used: 5 blocks\nTotal layers: 3 layers\n\nSpatial relationships:\n- The yellow and red cubes sit adjacent to each other at the base\n- The green rectangular block sits horizontally on top of both cubes\n- Two orange triangular roof pieces sit on top of the green rectangle, meeting at the center to form a peak\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n- Block 3: Yellow cube (for bottom left)\n- Block 2: Red cube (for bottom right)\n- Block 4: Horizontal green rectangle (for middle layer)\n- Block 14: Orange triangular prism angled upward (for left roof piece)\n- Block 16: Orange triangular prism angled to the left (for right roof piece)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 3\n  Step2: Move block with index 2\n  Step3: Move block with index 4\n  Step4: Move block with index 14\n  Step5: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the ground up, starting with the base cubes, adding the horizontal connecting piece, and finishing with the roof elements.",

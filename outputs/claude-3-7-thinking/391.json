Main Target Image: The first image shows two structures made of building blocks:\n   - Left structure: Appears to be a toy train or vehicle with wheels\n   - Right structure: Appears to be some kind of architectural structure with arches/holes\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image: The second image shows 16 different building blocks, each with a number:\n   1-4: Red blocks with different arch/curve shapes\n   5: Blue cube\n   6: Green cube\n   7: Red cube\n   8: Green rectangular block (horizontal)\n   9: Green rectangular block (vertical)\n   10-12: Yellow rectangular blocks in different orientations\n   13: Orange cylinder (vertical)\n   14: Orange cylinder (horizontal)\n   15: Yellow curved/half-cylinder piece\n   16: Yellow cylinder (vertical)\n\nNow I'll analyze each structure in detail:\n\nLEFT STRUCTURE (Toy Train/Vehicle):\n- Bottom layer: Two orange horizontal cylinders (block #14) serving as wheels\n- Middle layer: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (looks like #11)\n- Top layer (from left to right):\n  - Green cube (#6)\n  - Blue cube (#5)\n  - Red cube (#7)\n  - Yellow half-cylinder/curved piece on top (#15)\n\nRIGHT STRUCTURE (Architectural Structure):\n- Bottom layer: Red block with multiple arches (combination of blocks #1, #2, #3)\n- Middle layer: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (looks like #11)\n- Upper middle: Red block with circular hole (#4 or combination)\n- Top layer: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (looks like #12)\n\nNow I'll determine the exact blocks needed and assembly order:\n\nLEFT STRUCTURE (Toy Train):\nBase: Two orange horizontal cylinders (#14) side by side\nMiddle: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (#11) on top of the cylinders\nTop layer (front to back):\n- Green cube (#6)\n- Blue cube (#5)\n- Red cube (#7)\nTop piece: Yellow half-cylinder curved piece (#15) on top of the blue and red cubes\n\nRIGHT STRUCTURE (Architectural Structure):\nBottom: Red arch blocks (#1, #2) forming a base with arches\nMiddle: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (#11) placed on top\nUpper middle: Red block with circular hole (#4 or combination of blocks)\nTop: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (#12) placed on top",

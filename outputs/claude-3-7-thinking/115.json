      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary image provided.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the main target image:\n- The structure appears to have multiple blocks arranged in a specific configuration.\n- It consists of the following elements:\n  1. A green rectangular block placed horizontally on top\n  2. An orange/red triangular prism on top of the green block\n  3. A blue square/rectangular block in the middle (looks like a vertical rectangular prism)\n  4. Two orange/red triangular prisms at the bottom on either side of the blue block\n  5. A larger orange/red triangular or wedge-shaped block on the right side\n\nNow, let's check the block dictionary to identify the corresponding blocks:\n\nBlock 1: Blue cube\nBlock 2: Green cube\nBlock 3: Orange/red cube\nBlock 4: Yellow cube\nBlock 5: Green horizontal rectangular prism (short and wide)\nBlock 6: Green horizontal rectangular prism (longer than 5)\nBlock 7: Green vertical rectangular prism\nBlock 8: Orange/red vertical rectangular prism\nBlock 9: Orange/red horizontal rectangular prism\nBlock 10: Orange/red cube\nBlock 11: Orange/red triangular prism (angled forward)\nBlock 12: Orange/red triangular prism (angled backward)\nBlock 13: Orange/red triangular wedge (angled left)\nBlock 14: Orange/red triangular wedge (angled right)\nBlock 15: Orange/red triangular wedge (angled forward)\nBlock 16: Orange/red triangular wedge (angled back)\n\nLooking at the target structure, I need to match these blocks:\n\n1. The green horizontal block on top appears to be Block 6 (green horizontal rectangular prism)\n2. The blue vertical block in the middle is likely Block 1 (blue cube) or could possibly be a blue rectangular prism that's not clearly visible in the dictionary\n3. The orange triangular prism on top appears to be Block 11 or 12\n4. The orange triangular shapes at the bottom sides appear to be Blocks 13-16 (triangular wedges) or 11-12 (triangular prisms)\n5. The larger orange shape on the right side appears to be Block 14 or 15\n\nNow I need to determine the exact blocks and their arrangement:\n- The blue block in the middle appears to be a vertical rectangular block, but I don't see a blue vertical rectangular prism in the dictionary. The closest is Block 1 (blue cube).\n- The orange triangular prism on top looks like Block 11.\n- The orange triangular shapes on the bottom look like Blocks 13 and 14 or 15.\n- The green block on top is Block 6.\n\nBased on my observation, I'll attempt to identify the precise blocks and assembly order.",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Target Structure\n\n## Main Target Image Description:\nThe structure consists of 5 building blocks arranged in 3 layers:\n- **Bottom Layer**: Two orange triangular wedges flanking a blue cubic block in the center\n- **Middle Layer**: One green horizontal rectangular block placed across the top of the blue block and triangles\n- **Top Layer**: One orange triangular prism placed on the green block\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The blue cubic block is positioned centrally in the bottom layer\n- Two orange triangular wedges are placed on either side of the blue cube\n- The green rectangular block spans horizontally across all three bottom pieces\n- The orange triangular prism sits on top of the green block, slightly to the right side\n\n## Block Selection from Dictionary:\nLooking at the block dictionary, I need the following blocks:\n- Block 1: Blue cube (for the central block in the bottom layer)\n- Block 6: Green horizontal rectangular prism (for the middle layer)\n- Block 11: Orange triangular prism angled forward (for the top layer)\n- Block 14: Orange triangular wedge angled right (for right side of bottom layer)\n- Block 13: Orange triangular wedge angled left (for left side of bottom layer)\n\n## Assembly Order:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the central blue cube, adding the flanking orange triangular wedges, placing the horizontal green block, and finally positioning the orange triangular prism on top.",

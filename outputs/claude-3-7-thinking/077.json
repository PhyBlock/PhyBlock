I need to:\n   - Analyze the target structure\n   - Identify which blocks from the dictionary are needed\n   - Determine an assembly order\n\nStarting with analyzing the target structure:\n\nThe structure appears to be a small house or castle-like construction with:\n- A base layer with an archway made of red/orange blocks\n- A middle layer with a green block and a blue block\n- A top layer with orange/red triangular roof pieces\n\nLet me count the blocks and identify the layers:\n\nLayer 1 (bottom):\n- Red arch piece (appears to be block #1)\n- Two orange triangular/ramp pieces on each side of the arch (appears to be blocks #15 and #16, or similar angled blocks)\n\nLayer 2 (middle):\n- One green cube on the left (appears to be block #6)\n- One blue cube on the right (appears to be block #5)\n\nLayer 3 (top/roof):\n- Two orange triangular roof pieces (appears to be blocks like #14 and #15)\n\nNow let me identify the specific blocks from the dictionary that match these:\n\nBlock #1: Red arch piece - this is clearly used as the center base\nBlock #5: Blue cube - used in the middle layer on the right\nBlock #6: Green cube - used in the middle layer on the left\nBlock #13: Orange cube - I don't see this exact block in the structure\nBlock #14, #15, #16: Orange triangular/ramp pieces - these appear to be used for the roof and the sides of the base\n\nLet me determine the exact blocks needed and the assembly sequence:",

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary image to determine how to construct the structure.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the main target image:\n- There are two separate structures in the image:\n  1. A larger structure on the left\n  2. A smaller structure on the right\n\nLet me describe each structure in detail:\n\n1. Larger structure (left):\n   - It has multiple layers\n   - At the bottom, there appears to be a red arch-like structure (looks like block #2 from the dictionary)\n   - In the middle, there are two orange cylindrical pillars\n   - There are two yellow rectangular blocks that serve as horizontal connectors\n   - At the top, there is an orange triangular block\n\n2. Smaller structure (right):\n   - It has a blue square block in the middle\n   - Green rectangular block on top\n   - Orange triangular blocks on the sides and top\n   \nNow, I'll identify the specific blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\nFor the larger structure (left):\n- Block #2 (red arch) for the bottom\n- Block #10, #11, or #12 (orange cylinders) for the middle pillars\n- Block #7 or #8 (yellow horizontal rectangles) for the connectors\n- Block #13, #14, #15, or #16 (orange triangular shapes) for the top\n\nFor the smaller structure (right):\n- Block #3 (blue cube) for the center\n- Block #4 or #6 (green rectangular block) for the top\n- Block #13, #14, #15, or #16 (orange triangular shapes) for the sides\n\nNow I need to be more precise about the orientations and exact blocks needed. Let me look more carefully:\n\nFor the larger structure (left):\n- The bottom appears to be block #2 (red arch)\n- The cylinders appear to be block #10 (vertical orange cylinders)\n- The horizontal connectors are block #7 or #8 (yellow rectangles)\n- The top triangle appears to be block #13 or #14 (orange triangles)\n\nFor the smaller structure (right):\n- The center is block #3 (blue cube)\n- The top green block is block #4 (horizontal green rectangle)\n- The triangular blocks appear to be block #14, #15, or #16 (orange triangles)\n\nLet me be even more precise by looking at the orientations more carefully:",

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image first:\n\nThe structure consists of:\n1. A tall orange cylindrical tower in the center\n2. A smaller orange cylindrical leg/support to the right of the main tower\n3. A yellow rectangular block connecting the main tower and the support cylinder\n4. An orange triangular roof/top on the main tower\n\nNow let's count the total blocks and layers:\n- Total blocks: 4 distinct elements (main tower, support cylinder, connecting rectangle, triangular top)\n- Layers: 3 layers (bottom cylinders, connecting rectangle, top triangle)\n\nSpatial relationships:\n- The main orange tower is vertical and taller\n- The secondary orange support cylinder is on the right side\n- The yellow rectangular block connects them horizontally\n- The orange triangular top sits on top of the main cylinder\n\nNow let's examine the block dictionary to find the matching blocks:\n\nFor the main tower:\n- This appears to be block #4 (an orange vertical cylinder)\n- It appears we need two of these stacked (since there's a line dividing the main tower)\n\nFor the support cylinder:\n- This appears to be block #4 as well (orange vertical cylinder)\n\nFor the connecting yellow rectangle:\n- This appears to be block #3 (horizontal yellow rectangle)\n\nFor the triangular top:\n- This appears to be block #11 (orange triangular roof)\n\nLet me double-check these selections:\n- Block #4 is indeed a vertical orange cylinder\n- Block #3 is indeed a horizontal yellow rectangle\n- Block #11 is indeed an orange triangular roof piece\n\nFor the assembly order, we should start from the bottom and work our way up:\n1. Place first vertical orange cylinder (#4) for the base of the main tower\n2. Place another vertical orange cylinder (#4) for the support leg\n3. Place the yellow horizontal rectangle (#3) to connect them\n4. Place the second vertical orange cylinder (#4) on top of the first one (for the main tower)\n5. Place the orange triangular roof (#11) on top",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Target Structure\n\n## Description of the Main Target Image\n- **Count & Layers**: The structure consists of 5 building blocks arranged in 3 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships**: \n  - Bottom layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks - one main vertical cylinder and one supporting cylinder to the right\n  - Middle layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block connecting the two cylinders about halfway up the main cylinder\n  - Upper layer: Another orange cylindrical block stacked on top of the main cylinder\n  - Top layer: An orange triangular block forming a roof on the very top\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\nBased on the target structure, I need to select the following blocks:\n- Block #4 (orange vertical cylinder) - Used 3 times: twice for the main tower and once for the support\n- Block #3 (yellow horizontal rectangular block) - Used once as the connector\n- Block #11 (orange triangular roof piece) - Used once for the top\n\n## Assembly Order\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4\n  Step2: Move block with index 4\n  Step3: Move block with index 3\n  Step4: Move block with index 4\n  Step5: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with placing the bottom support cylinders, then adds the connecting yellow block, followed by the upper cylinder, and finally topped with the triangular roof element.",

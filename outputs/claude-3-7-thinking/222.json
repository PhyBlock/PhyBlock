The main target image shows two structures:\n   - On the left: A red block with two semicircular indentations with a blue cube placed on top\n   - On the right: A more complex structure that looks like a tower with:\n     - A yellow rectangular base at the bottom\n     - Two orange cylindrical pillars\n     - Another yellow rectangular block on top of the pillars\n     - A red house-like structure with an arch doorway and an orange triangular roof\n\n2. The block dictionary shows 16 different blocks with indices:\n   - 1-5: Various red blocks with different shapes (arches, indentations)\n   - 6: Blue cube\n   - 7: Green cube\n   - 8: Yellow cube\n   - 9-11: Yellow rectangular blocks in different orientations\n   - 12-13: Orange cylindrical blocks\n   - 14-16: Orange triangular roof-like pieces in different orientations\n\nNow let me identify the blocks needed for the structures in the main image:\n\nLeft structure:\n- Block #3: Red block with two semicircular indentations\n- Block #6: Blue cube\n\nRight structure (tower):\n- Base: Block #9 or #10 (yellow rectangular block laid horizontally)\n- Pillars: Two of Block #12 (orange cylindrical blocks)\n- Middle platform: Block #9 or #10 (another yellow rectangular block)\n- House structure: Block #1 or #2 (red arch block)\n- Roof: One of Blocks #14, #15, or #16 (orange triangular blocks)\n\nLet me look more carefully at the orientations:\n\nLeft structure:\n- The red block with indentations appears to be Block #3\n- The blue cube is Block #6\n\nRight structure:\n- Bottom yellow block appears to be Block #10 (horizontal yellow rectangle)\n- The orange cylinders are Block #12\n- Middle yellow block appears to be Block #10 again\n- The red house with arch appears to be Block #1\n- The roof appears to be Block #14\n\nLet me count the total blocks and layers:\n- Left structure: 2 blocks, 2 layers\n- Right structure: 6 blocks (1 base + 2 cylinders + 1 middle platform + 1 house + 1 roof), 4 layers\n\nNow I'll determine a logical assembly order:",

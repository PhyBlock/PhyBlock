      "thinking": "Let me analyze the task and images carefully:\n\nFirst image (main target image):\n- This shows a structure made of building blocks\n- The structure appears to have 3 layers:\n  - Top layer: A red rectangular block with a semi-circular cutout\n  - Middle layer: A green rectangular bar crossing horizontally through the middle\n  - Bottom layer: Another red rectangular block with a semi-circular cutout\n- When viewed together, the two red blocks with the cutouts create a circular hole through the structure, with the green bar passing through the middle of this hole\n\nSecond image (block dictionary):\n- This shows 14 different building blocks with indexes 1-14\n- Blocks 1-8 are red with various shapes and cutouts\n- Blocks 9-14 are green with various shapes\n\nTo match the target structure, I need to identify which specific blocks from the dictionary are used and in what order.\n\nLet me analyze the red blocks with cutouts more carefully:\n- Block 1: Red block with semi-circular cutout on one side \n- Block 2: Red block with semi-circular cutout on one side (oriented differently than 1)\n- Block 3: Red block with curved cutout in corner\n- Block 4: Red block with curved cutout in corner (oriented differently than 3)\n- Block 5: Red block with semi-circular cutout on opposite sides\n- Block 6: Red block with semi-circular cutout on opposite sides (oriented differently than 5)\n- Block 7: Red block with semi-circular cutout on opposite sides (oriented differently than 5,6)\n- Block 8: Red block with semi-circular cutout on opposite sides (oriented differently than 5,6,7)\n\nAnd the green blocks:\n- Block 9: Flat green rectangular block (horizontally oriented)\n- Block 10: Flat green rectangular block (horizontally oriented, appears similar to 9)\n- Block 11: Tall green rectangular block (vertically oriented)\n- Block 12: Tall green rectangular block (vertically oriented, appears similar to 11)\n- Block 13: Green rectangular block (oriented differently than 9-12)\n- Block 14: Green rectangular block (oriented differently than 9-13)\n\nLooking at the target structure:\n- The top red block appears to be Block 1 (semi-circular cutout facing downward)\n- The bottom red block appears to be Block 2 (semi-circular cutout facing upward)\n- The middle green bar appears to be Block 10 (horizontal flat rectangular block)\n\nNow for the assembly order, it makes sense to build from bottom to top:\n1. Start with Block 2 (bottom red piece)\n2. Place Block 10 (middle green bar) on top\n3. Place Block 1 (top red piece) on top\n\nSo the assembly sequence would be:\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2\n  Step2: Move block with index 10\n  Step3: Move block with index 1\n}",

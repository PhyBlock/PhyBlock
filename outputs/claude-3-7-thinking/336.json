      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and determine what blocks are needed to construct it, then provide assembly instructions.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the main target image:\n- The structure has two main parts:\n  1. A tower-like structure on the left\n  2. A yellow rectangular block placed on two orange cylindrical blocks on the right\n\nLet's break down the tower structure from bottom to top:\n- Bottom: A red block with semi-circular cutouts (looks like block #2 from the dictionary)\n- Middle layers: A blue cube (looks like block #5) next to a green rectangular block (looks like #7)\n- Top: A red block with an arch cutout (looks like block #1), with an orange triangular roof (looks like block #15 or #16)\n\nThe separate structure on the right consists of:\n- Two orange cylindrical blocks (looks like blocks #11 and #12) placed horizontally\n- A yellow rectangular block (looks like block #8 or #10) placed on top of the cylinders\n\nNow let me carefully match these with the blocks in the dictionary:\n\nFor the tower structure (bottom to top):\n- The bottom red block with two semi-circular cutouts matches block #2\n- The blue cube matches block #5\n- The green rectangular block matches block #7\n- The red block with an arch cutout matches block #1\n- The orange triangular roof piece matches block #16\n\nFor the separate structure:\n- The two orange cylindrical blocks match block #12 (horizontal orientation)\n- The yellow rectangular block on top matches block #10 (horizontal orientation)\n\nNow, let me determine the assembly order. Typically, we build from bottom to top:\n\nFor the tower:\n1. Place block #2 (red block with semi-circular cutouts) as the base\n2. Place block #7 (green rectangular block) on top of the red base\n3. Place block #5 (blue cube) next to the green block on the same level\n4. Place block #1 (red block with arch) on top of blocks #5 and #7\n5. Place block #16 (orange triangular roof) on top of block #1\n\nFor the separate structure:\n6. Place first block #12 (orange cylinder) horizontally on the ground\n7. Place second block #12 (orange cylinder) horizontally next to the first one\n8. Place block #10 (yellow rectangular block) horizontally on top of the two cylinders",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n## Count & Layers\nThe structure consists of 8 building blocks arranged in two distinct sub-structures:\n1. A tower-like structure (left) with 5 blocks and 4 layers\n2. A bridge-like structure (right) with 3 blocks and 2 layers\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n1. Tower structure (from bottom to top):\n   - Base: Red block with two semi-circular cutouts\n   - Second layer: Green rectangular block positioned on the red base\n   - Third layer: Blue cube positioned on the green block\n   - Fourth layer: Red block with an arch cutout\n   - Top: Orange triangular roof piece\n\n2. Bridge structure:\n   - Base: Two orange cylindrical blocks placed horizontally and parallel to each other\n   - Top: Yellow long rectangular block placed horizontally across the two cylinders\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n- Block #2: Red block with two semi-circular cutouts (tower base)\n- Block #7: Green rectangular block (second layer of tower)\n- Block #5: Blue cube (third layer of tower)\n- Block #1: Red block with arch cutout (fourth layer of tower)\n- Block #16: Orange triangular roof (top of tower)\n- Block #12: Orange cylindrical block (used twice for bridge base)\n- Block #10: Yellow long rectangular block (bridge top)\n\n# Assembly Order\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 16\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n   Step7: Move block with index 12\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n}\n```",

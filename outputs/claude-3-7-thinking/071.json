      "thinking": "Let me analyze the target structure from the main image and the available blocks from the dictionary.\n\nMain Target Image Analysis:\nThe structure appears to have 4-5 layers:\n\nBottom layer (Layer 1):\n- 4 red arch blocks, forming a square-like base with arches on each side\n- Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks connecting the red arches\n\nSecond layer (Layer 2):\n- Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks sitting on top of the red arched blocks\n\nThird layer (Layer 3):\n- Two green vertical rectangular blocks/pillars\n\nFourth layer (Layer 4):\n- A yellow horizontal rectangular block sitting on top of the green pillars\n\nTop layer (Layer 5):\n- An orange triangular/wedge shaped block sitting on the yellow block\n\nNow, let me identify the specific blocks from the dictionary that match what we see in the structure:\n\nRed arch blocks (Layer 1): These appear to match block #1 in the dictionary - the red arch pieces. We need 4 of these.\n\nYellow horizontal blocks (Layers 1, 2, and 4): These look like block #8, #11, or #12 - horizontal yellow rectangular blocks. We need at least 4 of these.\n\nGreen vertical blocks/pillars (Layer 3): These match block #6 - vertical green rectangular blocks. We need 2 of these.\n\nOrange triangular block (Layer 5): This appears to be block #14 - an orange triangular/wedge shape.\n\nLet me count exactly how many blocks we need:\n- 4 red arch blocks (block #1)\n- 4 yellow horizontal blocks (blocks #8, #11, or #12)\n- 2 green vertical blocks (block #6)\n- 1 orange triangular block (block #14)\n\nLooking more carefully at the structure and the blocks:\n1. Bottom layer: 4 red arch blocks (#1) arranged in a square with 2 yellow horizontal blocks (#8, #11, or #12) connecting them\n2. Second layer: 2 yellow horizontal blocks (#8, #11, or #12) sitting on top\n3. Third layer: 2 green vertical blocks (#6) \n4. Fourth layer: 1 yellow horizontal block (#8, #11, or #12)\n5. Top layer: 1 orange triangular block (#14)\n\nTotal block count: 11 blocks\n\nNow I'll specify the exact indices based on their orientation in the structure:",

Bottom Layer: \n   - 4 red arch blocks arranged in a square pattern\n   - Each arch block has an opening facing outward\n\n2. Second Layer:\n   - 3 yellow horizontal rectangular blocks placed on top of the red arches\n   - These yellow blocks form a platform/base for the next layer\n\n3. Third Layer:\n   - 2 green vertical rectangular blocks/pillars standing on the yellow platform\n   - These pillars are placed parallel to each other\n\n4. Fourth Layer:\n   - 1 yellow horizontal rectangular block sitting on top of the green pillars\n\n5. Top Layer:\n   - 1 orange triangular/roof-shaped block placed on the top yellow platform\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n- Block #1 (red arch block): 4 pieces\n- Block #8 (yellow horizontal rectangular block): 3 pieces\n- Block #6 (green vertical rectangular block): 2 pieces\n- Block #14 (orange triangular block): 1 piece\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 8\n   Step8: Move block with index 6\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n   Step10: Move block with index 8\n   Step11: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts from the bottom layer and builds up, placing the red arch blocks first to form the base, then adding the yellow platforms, followed by the green pillars, another yellow platform on top, and finally the orange triangular roof piece.",

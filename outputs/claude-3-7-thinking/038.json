      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images provided:\n\n1. The Main Target Image (first image):\n   - This shows a red rectangular shape with a circular hole/cutout in the middle.\n   - The structure appears to be made up of multiple blocks that form a complete shape.\n   - Looking at it closely, it appears to be a cube-like structure with a circular tunnel through it.\n\n2. The Block Dictionary Image (second image):\n   - This shows 8 different red building blocks, each with a specific index (1-8).\n   - Each block appears to be a segment or piece that could be part of the main structure.\n   - The blocks have different cutouts and shapes that would form parts of the circular hole when assembled.\n\nNow I need to determine which blocks from the dictionary are needed to construct the main target structure, and in what order they should be assembled.\n\nLooking at the main target image, it shows a red rectangular block with a circular hole through it. The structure appears to be constructed from multiple pieces that fit together to form this shape with the cylindrical tunnel through the middle.\n\nLooking at the dictionary of blocks, I can see that each piece has a different curved cutout that would form part of the circular hole. I need to determine which pieces fit together to create the complete structure seen in the target image.\n\nBased on my observation, the main target appears to be a square/rectangular block with a circular hole going through it horizontally. It looks like it's made up of 4 pieces - two on top and two on bottom.\n\nFrom the block dictionary:\n- Blocks 1 and 2 appear to be similar pieces that could form the top or bottom half of one side\n- Blocks 3 and 4 appear to be curved pieces that could form part of the circular hole\n- Blocks 5 and 6 appear to be side pieces with curved cutouts\n- Blocks 7 and 8 appear to be side pieces with curved cutouts in different orientations\n\nLooking at the orientation and how the pieces would fit together to form the circular hole, I believe the structure would need:\n- Pieces for the left side of the structure\n- Pieces for the right side of the structure\n- Each side needs pieces that form the top and bottom portions of the circular hole\n\nBased on the shape and orientation, I think the required blocks would be 1, 2, 5, and 8. These would create the box with the circular hole through it when assembled properly.",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Target Structure\n\n## Main Target Image Description:\n- The target image shows a red rectangular block with a circular hole/tunnel running through its center.\n- The structure appears to be made of 4 identical parts that connect to form the complete shape.\n- There are 2 layers (top and bottom) with 2 blocks in each layer.\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The structure has a symmetrical design with matching top and bottom halves.\n- Each block forms one quarter of the structure, with the circular cutouts aligning perfectly to create the tunnel.\n- The blocks are arranged in a 2Ã—2 configuration when viewed from the front.\n\n## Required Blocks Selection:\nLooking at the block dictionary, I can see that I need blocks that will form the corners of the structure with appropriate circular cutouts. Based on careful examination of the orientations:\n\n- Block #1: Forms the top-left quarter\n- Block #2: Forms the top-right quarter\n- Block #1: Forms the bottom-left quarter (reusing the same block)\n- Block #2: Forms the bottom-right quarter (reusing the same block)\n\n## Assembly Order:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly would start with the bottom layer (blocks 1 and 2) and then add the top layer (another set of blocks 1 and 2) to complete the structure with the circular hole running through it.",

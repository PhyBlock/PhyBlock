      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary, then determine how to construct the target structure.\n\nMain Target Image Analysis:\n- The target structure appears to be a rectangular prism made up of several colored building blocks.\n- I can see the following colors in the structure: green, yellow, red, and blue.\n- The structure has multiple layers and appears to have a frame-like design with green blocks on top and bottom, yellow on the left side, and red and blue blocks stacked in the middle.\n\nLet me count the blocks and identify the layers:\n\nLayer structure from bottom to top:\n1. Bottom layer: A horizontal green rectangular block\n2. Middle layers: \n   - A vertical yellow rectangular block on the left side\n   - Stacked from bottom to top: red cube, blue cube, red cube\n3. Top layer: A horizontal green rectangular block\n\nSo I count 6 blocks total: 2 green horizontal rectangles (top and bottom), 1 yellow vertical rectangle (left side), and 3 cubes in the middle (red, blue, red from bottom to top).\n\nNow let me identify the required blocks from the dictionary:\n\nFor the green horizontal rectangles (top and bottom):\n- Looking at the green blocks in the dictionary, I see options #2 (cube), #6, #7, #8 (vertical), #9 (vertical), #10, and #11.\n- The horizontal green rectangles appear to match #10 or #11, which seem to be similar horizontal rectangles.\n\nFor the yellow vertical rectangle on the left:\n- Looking at yellow blocks, I see #5 (cube), #12 (horizontal), #13 (horizontal), #14 (vertical), #15 (vertical), and #16 (horizontal).\n- The vertical yellow rectangle would match #14 or #15.\n\nFor the red cubes:\n- Looking at red blocks, I see #3 (orange cube) and #4 (red cube).\n- The red cubes in the structure would match #4.\n\nFor the blue cube:\n- There's a blue cube #1 in the dictionary.\n\nNow I need to determine the exact matches based on dimensions and orientation:\n\nFor the horizontal green rectangles at top and bottom:\n- Comparing #10 and #11, they look similar but might have different proportions. From what I can see, #11 seems to match the horizontal green rectangles better.\n\nFor the vertical yellow rectangle:\n- Comparing #14 and #15, they appear similar but might have different heights or proportions. Based on the image, #15 seems to match the vertical yellow block better.\n\nFor the red cubes, it's clearly #4.\nFor the blue cube, it's clearly #1.\n\nNow for assembly order, we typically build from bottom to top:\n\nStep 1: Place the bottom horizontal green rectangle (#11)\nStep 2: Place the vertical yellow rectangle on the left side (#15)\nStep 3: Place the bottom red cube (#4)\nStep 4: Place the blue cube on top of the bottom red cube (#1)\nStep 5: Place the top red cube on top of the blue cube (#4)\nStep 6: Place the top horizontal green rectangle (#11)",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n## Count & Layers\nThe target structure consists of 6 building blocks arranged in what appears to be a rectangular frame-like structure with:\n- 2 horizontal green rectangular blocks (top and bottom)\n- 1 vertical yellow rectangular block (left side)\n- 3 cube blocks in the middle column (red, blue, red from bottom to top)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The structure has a U-shaped frame made of green blocks (top and bottom) and a yellow block (left side)\n- Inside this frame are 3 stacked cubes: red cube at bottom, blue cube in middle, red cube at top\n- The green blocks form horizontal caps at the top and bottom\n- The yellow block spans the entire left side height\n- The stacked cubes fill the right side of the frame\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n1. Two horizontal green rectangular blocks (for top and bottom) - Block #11\n2. One vertical yellow rectangular block (for left side) - Block #15\n3. Two red cubes (for top and bottom positions in the stack) - Block #4\n4. One blue cube (for middle position in the stack) - Block #1\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 11\n   Step2: Move block with index 15\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from bottom to top, starting with the bottom green block, then adding the vertical yellow side, followed by stacking the three cubes, and finally placing the top green block.",

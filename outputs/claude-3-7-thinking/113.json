      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to identify the required blocks and assembly order.\n\n## Main Target Image Analysis:\n\nThe main target image shows a structure resembling a small house or tower with several parts:\n\n1. At the bottom: A red structure with two semi-circular cutouts (like a bridge or support)\n2. Above that: A blue cube\n3. Above the blue cube: A green rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n4. Above the green block: A red structure with an arch/semicircular opening (like a small house or doorway)\n5. At the very top: An orange/reddish triangular roof piece\n\nTotal layers: 5 distinct layers\nTotal blocks: Approximately 5-6 main blocks\n\n## Block Dictionary Analysis:\n\nLooking at the dictionary (numbered 1-16), I can identify the following blocks:\n\n1. Red arch/doorway block (left-facing)\n2. Red arch/doorway block (right-facing)\n3. Red curved block with semi-circular cutout (left orientation)\n4. Red curved block with semi-circular cutout (right orientation)\n5. Red vertical block with cutout\n6. Red vertical block with curve\n7. Blue cube\n8. Yellow cube\n9. Green horizontal rectangular block\n10. Green horizontal rectangular block (appears similar to 9)\n11. Orange/reddish flat vertical piece\n12. Orange/reddish cube\n13. Orange/reddish triangular piece (one orientation)\n14. Orange/reddish triangular piece (another orientation)\n15. Orange/reddish triangular block (side view)\n16. Orange/reddish triangular block (another side view)\n\n## Matching Blocks from Dictionary to Target Structure:\n\nFor the target structure, from bottom to top:\n1. Bottom red \"bridge\" with two cutouts: This appears to be made of blocks 3 and 4 positioned side by side\n2. Blue cube: Block 7\n3. Green rectangular block: Block 9 or 10 (they look very similar, but I'll go with 9)\n4. Red house/doorway structure: Appears to be Block 1\n5. Triangular roof: Appears to be Block 14\n\n## Assembly Order:\nLet's determine a logical assembly order from bottom to top:\n\n1. First, place the bottom support structure: Blocks 3 and 4 side by side\n2. Place the blue cube (Block 7) on top of this support\n3. Place the green rectangular block (Block 9) on top of the blue cube\n4. Place the red house/doorway structure (Block 1) on top of the green block\n5. Place the triangular roof piece (Block 14) on top of the red house structure",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure consists of multiple blocks arranged to form what looks like a small tower or house. Let me describe it in detail:\n\n## Count & Layers:\n- Total blocks: 6 distinct blocks\n- Total layers: 4 vertical layers\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- Bottom layer: A red block with two curved cutouts (like a bridge or stand)\n- Second layer: A blue cube positioned in the center of the structure\n- Third layer: A green rectangular block (horizontal orientation) placed on top of the blue cube\n- Fourth layer: A red rectangular block with an arched opening at the front\n- Top: An orange triangular roof piece sitting on the red rectangular block\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Block 3: Red curved block with semi-circular cutout (left side)\n2. Block 4: Red curved block with semi-circular cutout (right side)\n3. Block 7: Blue cube\n4. Block 9: Green horizontal rectangular block\n5. Block 1: Red arch/doorway block\n6. Block 14: Orange triangular roof piece\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the base supports, then adding the central blocks, and finally placing the roof.",

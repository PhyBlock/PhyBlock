      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and then select the appropriate blocks from the dictionary to construct it. Let me break down the task.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the main target image:\n\nThe main target image shows a structure that looks like a tower or doorway made of colored blocks. It has:\n1. Green rectangular blocks at the top and bottom\n2. Yellow rectangular blocks forming the sides/pillars\n3. A red block in the middle bottom part\n\nNow let's count the blocks and identify the layers:\n\nLooking at the structure:\n- Top layer: 1 green rectangular block (horizontally placed)\n- Middle layers: 2 yellow tall rectangular blocks forming the sides\n- Bottom layer: 1 green rectangular block (horizontally placed)\n- Inside/middle: 1 red cube\n\nTotal blocks: 5 distinct blocks\n\nNow let's examine the block dictionary to identify which blocks I need:\n\nLooking at the block dictionary:\n1. Blue cube (index 1)\n2. Green cube (index 2)\n3. Orange cube (index 3)\n4. Red cube (index 4)\n5. Yellow cube (index 5)\n6-16. Various rectangular blocks in different colors and orientations\n\nFor the target structure, I need:\n- For the top green horizontal block: Looking at the dictionary, block index 6 or 7 appears to be a green horizontal rectangular block\n- For the yellow vertical sides: Block indexes 13 and 14 appear to be yellow vertical rectangular blocks\n- For the bottom green horizontal block: Again, block index 6 or 7\n- For the red block inside: Block index 4 (red cube)\n\nLet me determine the exact blocks needed:\n- Top green block: Based on orientation, I believe index 6 is the correct green horizontal rectangular block\n- Yellow vertical sides: Indexes 13 and 14 (yellow vertical rectangular blocks)\n- Bottom green block: Index 6 again (same as top)\n- Red block inside: Index 4 (red cube)\n\nNow, for the assembly order, I should start from the bottom and work my way up:\n\n1. Place bottom green horizontal block (index 6)\n2. Place left yellow vertical block (index 13)\n3. Place right yellow vertical block (index 14)\n4. Place red cube inside (index 4)\n5. Place top green horizontal block (index 6)\n\nLooking more carefully, I think index 6 and 7 show the same green rectangular block but in different viewing angles. The one that matches the orientation in the target image better is index 6.\n\nSimilarly, for the yellow vertical blocks, indexes 13 and 14 seem to show the same yellow rectangular block from slightly different angles. The ones that match the target image would be index 13 for both sides.\n\nLet me revise my choices:\n- Bottom green block: Index 6\n- Left yellow vertical block: Index 13\n- Right yellow vertical block: Index 13\n- Red cube: Index 4\n- Top green block: Index 6\n\nActually, let me examine the dimensions more carefully.\n\nLooking at the dictionary image:\n- Index 6 is a green horizontal rectangular block that seems wider than it is tall\n- Index 7 is a similar green horizontal rectangular block but from a different angle\n- Index 10 is a green horizontal rectangular block seen from yet another angle\n\nFor the yellow vertical blocks:\n- Index 13 and 14 are yellow vertical rectangular blocks\n\nIt's a bit difficult to determine the exact dimensions and orientations from the images, but based on what I can see, I believe the correct blocks would be:\n- Bottom and top green blocks: Index 6\n- Yellow vertical sides: Index 13\n- Red cube: Index 4\n\nLet me make my final determination:",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\n## Count & Layers\nThe target structure consists of 5 building blocks arranged in 3 distinct layers:\n- Top layer: 1 green horizontal rectangular block\n- Middle layer: 2 yellow vertical rectangular blocks forming the sides with a gap between them\n- Bottom layer: 1 green horizontal rectangular block\n- Inside the structure (middle-bottom area): 1 red cube\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The two green rectangular blocks form the top and bottom of the structure\n- The two yellow rectangular blocks stand vertically between the green blocks, creating a frame with an opening in the middle\n- The red cube sits at the bottom of the opening created by the yellow blocks, resting on the bottom green block\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks from the dictionary are required:\n\n1. Green horizontal rectangular blocks (for top and bottom): Block index 6\n2. Yellow vertical rectangular blocks (for sides): Block index 13 \n3. Red cube (for inside): Block index 4\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 13\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the bottom green block as the foundation, adds the two yellow vertical blocks on top, places the red cube inside the frame, and finally caps the structure with the top green block.",

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary image.\n\nMain Target Image Analysis:\nThe target structure appears to be a construction with several parts:\n1. On the left side: A red arch-like structure with yellow beams on top\n2. On the right side: A tall orange tower/column with a triangular top, and two shorter orange cylinders with yellow beams connecting them\n\nLet me count the blocks and identify the layers:\n\nLeft Structure:\n- Bottom layer: At least 2 red arch blocks\n- Middle layer: 2-3 yellow rectangular beams\n- Top layer: 1-2 red blocks\n\nRight Structure:\n- Long orange vertical cylinder (appears to be 2 cylinders stacked)\n- Orange triangular top piece\n- Two shorter orange cylinders at the bottom\n- Yellow beams connecting the cylinders\n\nNow let me identify the specific blocks from the dictionary:\n\nBlock Dictionary:\n1. Red arch block (facing one direction)\n2. Red arch block (facing opposite direction)\n3. Red vertical block with arch\n4. Yellow horizontal beam (long)\n5. Yellow horizontal beam (short)\n6. Yellow vertical beam\n7. Yellow horizontal beam (medium)\n8. Yellow horizontal beam (medium, different angle)\n9. Orange vertical cylinder\n10. Orange horizontal cylinder\n11. Orange cube\n12. Orange triangular prism\n13-16. Different orientations of orange triangular pieces\n\nLooking at the main structure again:\n\nLeft Structure:\n- Uses blocks #1 and #2 (red arch blocks) on the bottom\n- Uses blocks like #4, #5, #7, or #8 (yellow beams) in the middle\n- Uses possibly block #3 or cube-like red blocks on top\n\nRight Structure:\n- Uses block #9 (orange vertical cylinder) for the main tower\n- Uses block #12 (orange triangular prism) for the top\n- Uses block #9 (orange vertical cylinder) for the two shorter columns\n- Uses blocks like #4, #7, or #8 (yellow horizontal beams) to connect\n\nNow let me plan the assembly order from bottom to top:",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure consists of two distinct sub-structures:\n\n## Structure Count & Layers\n- Total blocks used: 11 blocks\n- Left structure: 6 blocks (2 layers)\n- Right structure: 5 blocks (3 layers)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n1. Left Structure:\n   - Bottom layer: 3 red blocks forming an arch-like structure (2 arch blocks on sides with a solid block on top)\n   - Top layer: 3 yellow rectangular beams placed horizontally on top of the red blocks\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - Base: 2 orange cylindrical columns standing vertically\n   - Middle: 2 yellow rectangular beams connecting the columns horizontally\n   - Top: 1 tall orange cylinder with a triangular orange pyramid on top\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, these are the blocks needed:\n- Block #1: Red arch block (1 piece)\n- Block #2: Red arch block facing opposite direction (1 piece)\n- Block #3: Red vertical block with arch cutout (1 piece)\n- Block #4: Long yellow horizontal beam (2 pieces)\n- Block #5: Short yellow horizontal beam (1 piece)\n- Block #9: Orange vertical cylinder (3 pieces)\n- Block #12: Orange triangular pyramid (1 piece)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 4\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n   Step9: Move block with index 9\n   Step10: Move block with index 5\n   Step11: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, starting with the left arch structure, then adding the right tower structure.",

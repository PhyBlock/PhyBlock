Block #1 - Red arch block (front opening)\n2. Block #2 - Red arch block (side opening)\n3. Block #7 - Green horizontal rectangular block\n4. Block #8 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n5. Block #10 - Yellow half-cylinder/semicircle block\n6. Block #15 - Orange triangular ramp (sloped downward to the right)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the left structure (steps 1-4) and then builds the right structure (steps 5-7), starting from the base layer and working upward for each structure.",

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the main target image and the block dictionary to determine how to build the structure.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the main target image (top image):\nThe structure appears to be a small house-like building with multiple components:\n1. The base consists of two green vertical rectangular pillars (like legs)\n2. There's a yellow horizontal rectangular beam connecting the two green pillars\n3. On top of the yellow beam is a red house-shaped structure with an arched doorway\n4. The red house has an orange/light-red triangular roof\n\nNow let's count the layers and blocks:\n- Layer 1 (bottom): Two green vertical pillars\n- Layer 2 (middle): One yellow horizontal beam\n- Layer 3 (top): Red house structure with orange roof\nTotal layers: 3\n\nTotal blocks:\n- 2 green pillars\n- 1 yellow beam\n- 1 red house structure with arch\n- 2-4 orange roof triangular pieces\n\nNow I'll examine the block dictionary (bottom image) to identify the specific blocks needed:\n\nBlock #1: Red arch piece (front view)\nBlock #2: Red arch piece (side view, left opening)\nBlock #3: Red arch piece (side view, right opening)\nBlock #4: Green horizontal small rectangle\nBlock #5: Green vertical pillar/rectangle\nBlock #6: Green horizontal longer rectangle\nBlock #7: Green horizontal rectangle (similar to #6 but might be different dimensions)\nBlock #8: Yellow horizontal rectangle\nBlock #9: Yellow vertical rectangle/pillar\nBlock #10: Orange/light-red triangular piece (front/back view)\nBlock #11: Orange/light-red rectangular piece\nBlock #12: Orange/light-red triangular piece (side view)\nBlock #13: Orange/light-red triangular piece (angled view)\nBlock #14: Orange/light-red triangular piece (angled view, different orientation)\nBlock #15: Orange/light-red triangular piece (angled view, different orientation)\nBlock #16: Orange/light-red triangular piece (angled view, different orientation)\n\nBased on my analysis, the structure requires:\n1. Two green vertical pillars - Block #5 (used twice)\n2. One yellow horizontal beam - Block #8\n3. One red house structure with arch - Block #1 (visible front)\n4. For the orange roof, it appears to be made of triangular pieces. Looking at the orientation in the main image, it appears we need Block #10 for the front triangular piece and likely Block #12 for the side triangular piece. They might need Block #14 and #16 for the other sides of the roof.\n\nNow, let me determine the assembly order:\n1. Start with the two green pillars as the foundation - Block #5 (twice)\n2. Place the yellow horizontal beam on top of the pillars - Block #8\n3. Place the red house structure on top of the yellow beam - Block #1\n4. Add the triangular roof pieces - Blocks #10, #12, and possibly #14 and #16",

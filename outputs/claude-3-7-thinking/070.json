      "thinking": "Let me analyze the two images provided:\n\n1. Main Target Image (top image):\nThis shows a structure made of red and yellow building blocks. The structure appears to be symmetrical and looks like an \"H\" shape. It consists of:\n- Red blocks with arches/semicircular cutouts\n- Yellow rectangular blocks that connect the red blocks\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image (bottom image):\nThis shows 14 different building blocks with their indices:\n- Blocks 1-8 are red blocks with various cutouts and orientations\n- Blocks 9-14 are yellow rectangular blocks in different orientations\n\nNow I'll analyze the target structure in more detail:\n\nThe structure has 3 visible layers:\n1. Bottom layer: Red blocks with arch cutouts\n2. Middle layer: Yellow horizontal connecting blocks\n3. Top layer: Red blocks with arch cutouts\n\nLooking at the specific blocks in the target structure:\n- The bottom layer has 4 red blocks with arches (2 on each side of the H)\n- The middle layer has yellow connecting bars\n- The top layer has 4 red blocks with arches (2 on each side of the H)\n\nLet me identify exactly which blocks from the dictionary are used:\n\nFor the red blocks:\n- Blocks 1 & 2 appear to be used for the top portions\n- Blocks 1 & 2 also appear to be repeated for the bottom portions\n(Note: Blocks 1 & 2 look like the same block but mirrored/from different angles)\n\nFor the yellow blocks:\n- I see yellow horizontal blocks connecting the red blocks (likely blocks 9, 10, 13, or 14)\n\nLet me determine the exact blocks and their positions:\n\nThe H-shaped structure appears to consist of:\n- 2 blocks of index 1 (top-left and bottom-left)\n- 2 blocks of index 2 (top-right and bottom-right)\n- 3 yellow blocks connecting them (appears to be blocks 9, 10 or 13, 14)\n\nFor assembly order, I should start from the bottom up:\n1. Place the bottom red blocks (indices 1 and 2)\n2. Place the yellow connecting blocks\n3. Place the top red blocks (indices 1 and 2)",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\n## Structure Description\nThe target structure is an H-shaped construction made of red and yellow building blocks. It consists of:\n- 8 red blocks with arch/semicircular cutouts (4 on each side)\n- 3 yellow rectangular blocks forming the horizontal connecting piece\n\nThe structure has 2 layers:\n1. Bottom layer - 4 red arch blocks arranged in pairs, forming the vertical posts of the H\n2. Middle layer - 3 yellow rectangular blocks forming the horizontal connecting bar\n3. Top layer - 4 red arch blocks arranged in pairs, mirroring the bottom layer\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The red blocks are arranged in 4 vertical columns (2 on each side)\n- Each column contains 2 red blocks stacked vertically\n- The yellow horizontal bar connects the two sides in the middle\n- The structure has a symmetrical design, resembling the letter H\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n- Red arch blocks:\n  - Block index 1 (used for top-left and bottom-left positions)\n  - Block index 2 (used for top-right and bottom-right positions)\n  - Block index 3 (used for top-left and bottom-left inner positions)\n  - Block index 4 (used for top-right and bottom-right inner positions)\n\n- Yellow rectangular blocks:\n  - Block index 9 (used for the left section of the horizontal bar)\n  - Block index 10 (used for the right section of the horizontal bar)\n  - Block index 13 (used for the center section of the horizontal bar)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 3\n    Step11: Move block with index 4\n}\n```",

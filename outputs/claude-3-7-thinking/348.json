      "thinking": "I need to analyze the main target image and select appropriate blocks from the dictionary to construct the structure.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the main target image:\n- There are two separate structures in the image:\n  1. A structure on the left made of various colored blocks\n  2. A structure on the right made of mostly orange/red shapes with some blue blocks\n\nFor the left structure, I can see:\n- A blue cubic block at the bottom\n- A yellow rectangular block horizontally placed on top\n- A green cube on the right side\n- A red cube in the middle front\n- An orange/red triangular prism on top of the yellow block\n\nFor the right structure, I can see:\n- Two orange/red cylindrical shapes in the middle\n- A triangular orange/red prism on top of the cylinders\n- Two blue cube/rectangular blocks on either side\n- Additional triangular orange/red blocks on the sides\n\nNow let me look at the block dictionary:\n1. Red arch/tunnel shape\n2. Red U-shaped block\n3. Red C-shaped block\n4. Blue cube\n5. Green cube\n6. Blue rectangular block (vertical)\n7. Yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n8. Yellow rectangular block (horizontal, appears similar to 7)\n9. Yellow rectangular block (horizontal, appears similar to 7 and 8)\n10. Orange cylindrical block (vertical)\n11. Orange cylindrical block (horizontal)\n12. Orange cylindrical block (horizontal, similar to 11)\n13. Orange/red flat rectangular block\n14. Orange/red triangular prism (angled view)\n15. Orange/red triangular prism (angled view, different orientation)\n16. Orange/red triangular prism (angled view, different orientation)\n\nNow I'll match the blocks needed for both structures:\n\nLeft structure:\n- Blue cube (block 4)\n- Yellow rectangular block (block 7, 8, or 9 - they look very similar, probably 7)\n- Green cube (block 5)\n- Red cube (none in the dictionary that perfectly matches, but block 2 might be used differently)\n- Orange/red triangular prism (looks like block 15)\n\nRight structure:\n- Orange cylindrical blocks (block 10 for vertical, block 11 or 12 for horizontal)\n- Blue rectangular blocks (block 6)\n- Orange/red triangular prisms (blocks 14, 15, 16 depending on orientation)\n\nLet me review my selections and finalize which specific blocks are needed and in what order they should be assembled.",

      "thinking": "Let me analyze the images provided:\n\n1. Main Target Image (First Image):\nThis shows a structure with several building blocks. Let me break it down:\n- At the bottom, there are two orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically\n- Atop these two cylinders is a horizontal yellow rectangular block that connects them\n- On top of one of the orange cylinders (the left one) is another orange cylinder extending upward\n- The topmost piece is a yellow semicircular/half-cylinder block sitting on the tall orange cylinder\n\nSo the structure has:\n- 3 orange cylinders (2 on bottom, 1 extending upward)\n- 1 yellow rectangular block (horizontal, connecting the two bottom cylinders)\n- 1 yellow semicircular/half-cylinder block (at the very top)\n- Total: 5 blocks in 3 layers\n\n2. Block Dictionary Image (Second Image):\nThis shows 16 different building blocks, each with a unique index number:\n1-6: Yellow rectangular blocks in different orientations\n7-9: Orange cylindrical blocks in different orientations\n10-16: Various yellow blocks in different shapes and orientations, including some half-cylinders\n\nNow, I need to identify which specific blocks from the dictionary match the ones in the target structure:\n\nFor the orange cylinders standing vertically at the bottom: These match block #7 (vertical orange cylinder)\nFor the tall orange cylinder on top: Also matches block #7\nFor the horizontal yellow rectangular block: This matches block #2 (horizontal yellow rectangle)\nFor the yellow semicircular top: This appears to match block #11 (yellow half-cylinder)\n\nSo I need:\n- 3× Block #7 (orange vertical cylinders)\n- 1× Block #2 (yellow horizontal rectangle)\n- 1× Block #11 (yellow half-cylinder at the top)\n\nFor assembly order, I should start from the bottom and work upward:\n1. Place two vertical orange cylinders (Block #7) as the base\n2. Place the horizontal yellow rectangle (Block #2) on top of these cylinders\n3. Place another vertical orange cylinder (Block #7) on one side of the structure\n4. Place the yellow half-cylinder (Block #11) on top of the tall orange cylinder",

      "text": "# Analysis of Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure consists of 4 building blocks arranged in 3 layers:\n\n- Bottom layer (base): Two orange vertical cylindrical blocks positioned side by side with some space between them\n- Middle layer: One yellow horizontal rectangular block placed across the two orange cylinders, connecting them\n- Top layer: One yellow semicircular/half-cylinder block placed on top of the leftmost orange cylinder\n\nThe structure forms a shape somewhat resembling the letter \"T\" with the two orange cylinders as the base, connected by the yellow rectangle, and the third orange cylinder extending upward with the yellow half-cylinder cap on top.\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks:\n- 3× Block #7 (orange vertical cylinders)\n- 1× Block #2 (horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n- 1× Block #11 (yellow half-cylinder cap)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence places the two base cylinders first, then connects them with the horizontal rectangle, adds the third cylinder on top of one of the base cylinders, and finally places the half-cylinder cap at the very top.",

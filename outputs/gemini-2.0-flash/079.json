            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and construct the assembly instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure consists of 11 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** There are three distinct layers:\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** Composed of 4 blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Composed of 3 blocks.\n    *   **Top Layer:** Composed of 4 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** From left to right: a tilted orange triangular block, a yellow square block, a red semicircular block with the curved side facing forward, and another yellow square block, followed by a tilted orange triangular block.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** From left to right: an orange rectangular block, a green square block, and a blue square block.\n    *   **Top Layer:** Two tilted orange triangular blocks forming an inverted 'V' shape over the green and blue squares.\n\n**2. Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks from the dictionary are required:\n\n*   Two orange triangular blocks tilted to the left: Index 13\n*   Two yellow square blocks: Index 9\n*   One red semicircular block: Index 1\n*   One orange rectangular block: Index 11\n*   One green square block: Index 7\n*   One blue square block: Index 6\n*   Two orange triangular blocks tilted to the right: Index 15\n\n**3. Determining the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a possible assembly sequence based on the selected blocks:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Assembly Order:**\n\n1.  The base is built first with the two tilted orange triangular blocks, two yellow square blocks and the red semicircular block.\n2.  The middle layer is then placed on top, consisting of the orange rectangular block, green square block and blue square block.\n3.  Finally, the two tilted orange triangular blocks that make up the top layer are put on top.\n"

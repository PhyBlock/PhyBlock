Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure on the left consists of 5 blocks, and the one on the right consists of 5 blocks. In total, there are 10 blocks in the structure.\n*   **Layers:**\n    *   Left Structure: The left structure has 3 layers. The bottom layer consists of two red blocks. The middle layer consists of a yellow block and a red block. The top layer is a yellow block.\n    *   Right Structure: The right structure has 3 layers. The bottom layer consists of two orange wedge blocks, with a blue rectangular block between them. The middle layer is an orange cylinder. The top layer is a smaller orange wedge.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Left Structure: The two red blocks (with arches) are placed adjacent to each other on the bottom layer. A yellow rectangular block sits on top of these, with a red block (with a circular hole) sitting on top of that. A yellow rectangular block sits on top of the red block with a circular hole.\n    *   Right Structure: The two orange wedge blocks are placed on the bottom layer, with the blue rectangular block in between. The orange cylinder sits directly above the blue rectangular block. The smaller orange wedge block is directly on top of the cylinder.\n\n**2. Block Selection from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Left Structure:**\n    *   Bottom Layer: Requires two blocks with index 1.\n    *   Middle Layer: Requires one block with index 7 and one block with index 5.\n    *   Top Layer: Requires one block with index 7.\n*   **Right Structure:**\n    *   Bottom Layer: Requires two blocks with index 13 and one block with index 6.\n    *   Middle Layer: Requires one block with index 8.\n    *   Top Layer: Requires one block with index 12.\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```"

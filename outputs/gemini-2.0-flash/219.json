Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** There are 10 blocks in the structure.\n*   **Layers:** The structure has 4 distinct layers (excluding the base).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:** This structure consists of an orange cylinder base forming 3 pillars, topped by a yellow horizontal rectangular block. On top of the yellow block sits another orange cylinder and a leaning orange triangle on the yellow horizontal rectangular block.\n    *   **Right Structure:** This structure consists of two red arch blocks topped by two green vertical rectangular blocks. The two arch blocks are adjacent to each other. The two green rectangular blocks are also adjacent and sitting on the arch blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks and indices from the dictionary:\n\n*   **Orange Cylinder (upright):** Block 8 (appears twice)\n*   **Yellow Horizontal Rectangular Block:** Block 7 (appears once)\n*   **Red Arch Block:** Block 2 (appears twice)\n*   **Green Vertical Rectangular Block:** Block 6 (appears twice)\n*   **Orange Leaning Triangle:** Block 15 (appears once)\n*   **Orange Cylinder (upright):** Block 11 (appears once)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the proposed assembly order based on the selected blocks:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n}\n```\n"

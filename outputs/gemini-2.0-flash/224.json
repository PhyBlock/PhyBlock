Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure is composed of 12 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** We can consider this structure to have approximately 3 layers in two separate parts. The first part has 3 layers and the second part is sitting alone.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Part 1:\n        *   The bottom layer consists of two red arch blocks placed side-by-side.\n        *   The middle layer has a yellow half-cylinder block and another one besides it sitting on top of the arch blocks.\n        *   The top layer consists of two yellow rectangular prism and one green prism.\n    *   Part 2:\n        *   The base has two horizontal orange cylinder blocks.\n        *   A horizontal green rectangular block is on top of the cylinder blocks.\n        *   An orange wedge is sitting on top of the green rectangular block.\n\n**2. Selection of Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the target image, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n*   Two red arch blocks: Index 1\n*   Two yellow half-cylinder block: Index 13\n*   Two yellow rectangular prism: Index 9\n*   One green rectangular prism: Index 7\n*   Two orange cylinder blocks: Index 11\n*   One green rectangular block: Index 6\n*   One orange wedge: Index 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

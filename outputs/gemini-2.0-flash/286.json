Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure contains a total of 13 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure can be viewed as having three main parts, one to the left, and one to the right each composed of several layers. The left structure has 4 layers: 2 blue blocks on the base, followed by a yellow block, followed by an arch block and two triangular blocks on top of the yellow block. The right structure has 3 layers: 2 cylinders as the base, a yellow block on top of them, and then a layer containing a blue block and a red block on top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:** Two blue blocks are placed side-by-side on the bottom. A yellow rectangular block rests on top of these two blue blocks. A red arch block sits on top of the yellow block. Two red triangle roof blocks sit on top of the arch block.\n    *   **Right Structure:** Two orange cylinders form the base. A long yellow block sits on top of the cylinders. A blue cube is placed next to a red cube on top of the yellow block.\n\n**2. Block Selection from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   Blue Rectangular Block (base of left structure): 6 (x2)\n*   Yellow Rectangular Block (middle of left structure, middle of right structure): 8 (x2)\n*   Red Arch Block (top of left structure): 1\n*   Red Triangle Roof Block (top of left structure): 13 (x2)\n*   Orange Cylinder (base of right structure): 11 (x2)\n*   Blue Cube (top of right structure): 2\n*   Red Cube (top of right structure): 4\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly order based on the selected blocks:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 4\"\n}\n```\n"

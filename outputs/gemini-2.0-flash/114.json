Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure is composed of 3 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** It consists of 2 layers. The first layer is composed of two orange triangular prism blocks. The second layer contains one blue cube block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The two orange triangular prism blocks are placed side-by-side on the ground to form a base. A blue cube sits on top of the center of the combined base, appearing to be supported by both prism blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Needed Blocks:\n    *   Two orange triangular prism blocks with the wider face on the bottom.\n    *   One blue cube block.\n*   Block Indices:\n    *   Block 1: Blue Cube\n    *   Block 10: Orange Triangular Prism (wider face on the bottom, slanted face to the right)\n    *   Block 15: Orange Triangular Prism (wider face on the bottom, slanted face to the left)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the visual structure and the blocks identified, the most logical assembly order is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n\"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n\"Step2\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n\"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n"

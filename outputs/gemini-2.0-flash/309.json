Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 17 blocks across multiple layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base:** The base of the main structure consists of three red arch blocks. Two orange triangle blocks flank the front of the base.\n    *   **Middle:** A yellow half-cylinder is positioned on top of the middle arch. To the left of the half cylinder is a blue square block. To the right is an orange rectangular prism. Behind the middle arch is a green square block. Another green rectangular prism is on the right side, behind the right arch.\n    *   **Top:** A yellow rectangular prism is placed on top of the blue square block. Another yellow rectangular prism is placed on top of the green square block. An orange triangle roof block is placed on top of the blue square block, and another orange triangle roof block is placed on top of the orange rectangular prism.\n    *   **Right Side Structure:** This is a separate structure composed of two red arch blocks and a green rectangular block in between.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices (and quantities):**\n    *   1: 5 (for the arches on the left and right structures)\n    *   4: 1 (blue cube)\n    *   5: 1 (green cube)\n    *   6: 1 (orange cube)\n    *   7: 1 (green rectangle)\n    *   8: 1 (green rectangle)\n    *   9: 2 (yellow rectangle on top of blue cube)\n    *   10: 1 (yellow half-cylinder)\n    *   11: 2 (orange roof)\n    *   14: 1 (orange ramp on the left)\n    *   15: 1 (orange ramp on the right)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step17\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```"

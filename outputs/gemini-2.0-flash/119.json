            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and construct the assembly instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure is composed of 6 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** There are three layers.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Contains 3 blocks - blue, red, green.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Contains 1 block - yellow.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Contains 2 blocks - yellow, orange.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The blue block forms the base on the left.\n    *   The red block is next to blue block (in front).\n    *   The green block is next to the blue block (behind).\n    *   The yellow block is placed on top of blue, red and green blocks, bridging across them.\n    *   Another smaller yellow block is placed on top of the front part of the previous yellow block.\n    *   The orange triangular block is on top of and in the middle of the yellow block.\n\n**2. Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the Main Target Image and the Block Dictionary, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Blue cube: Index 6\n*   Red cube: Index 12\n*   Green cube: Index 7\n*   Yellow block: Index 11\n*   Yellow block: Index 8\n*   Orange triangular block: Index 14\n\n**3. Determining the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the proposed assembly sequence:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Order:**\n\n1.  Place the blue cube first (index 6) as the foundation on the left.\n2.  Place the red cube (index 12) next to the blue cube (in front).\n3.  Place the green cube (index 7) next to the blue cube (behind).\n4.  Place the yellow block (index 11) on top of blue, red and green blocks, bridging across them.\n5.  Place the yellow cube (index 8) on the front part of the yellow block.\n6.  Place the orange triangular block (index 14) on top of and in the middle of the yellow block.\n\nThis order ensures that each block has a stable base to rest upon as the structure is built.\n"

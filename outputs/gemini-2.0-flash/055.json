Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure consists of 10 blocks in total.\n*   **Layers:** There are three distinct layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A yellow horizontal block (looks like block 11 or 12) is placed as the base. Two vertical green blocks (looks like block 7 or 8) are positioned on either side of a red cube (block 3). The horizontal block is supporting the vertical green and red cube\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** On top of the green blocks and red cube are again a yellow horizontal block (looks like block 11 or 12) is placed horizontally like the bottom one. On top of this block are a blue cube (block 1) and a red cube (block 3) on either side of the vertical green block (looks like block 7 or 8).\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Another yellow horizontal block (looks like block 11 or 12) is placed horizontally like the middle and bottom layers. It sits on top of the green blocks and the red cube.\n\n**2. Block Selection from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Based on the analysis, the required blocks and their indices are:\n    *   Blue Cube: 1\n    *   Red Cube: 3 (appears twice)\n    *   Vertical Green Block: 7 (appears twice)\n    *   Horizontal Yellow Block: 11 (appears three times)\n\n**3. Assembly Order Determination:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7\"\n}\n```\n"

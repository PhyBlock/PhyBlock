The two yellow blocks sit side-by-side on top of it, forming the second layer. The two green blocks sit on top of the yellow blocks in a similar fashion, forming the third layer. The orange triangular block sits on the top of the green blocks.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n-\t**Blocks:** 7 blocks\n-\t**Layers:** 5 layers\n    -\tLayer 1: Green rectangular block.\n    -\tLayer 2: Orange cylindrical block on top of the green block.\n    -\tLayer 3: Orange triangular block resting angled on the previous layers.\n    -\tLayer 4: Two green rectangular blocks on each sides of the triangle block.\n    -\tLayer 5: One yellow rectangular block placed across the top of the previous layer.\n    -   Layer 6: Blue rectangular block on top of the yellow block.\n-\t**Spatial Relationships:** The green block is the base. The orange cylinder sits on top of it. The orange triangle rests angled on top of the cylinder. The two green blocks stand as supports on each side. The yellow block rests on top of those green blocks. Finally, the blue block sits on top.\n\n## Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n-\tRed block with hole: Index 1\n-\tYellow rectangular blocks (horizontal): Index 8 (x2)\n-\tGreen rectangular blocks (vertical): Index 5 (x2)\n-\tOrange triangular block: Index 13\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n-\tGreen rectangular block (horizontal): Index 4\n-\tOrange cylindrical block: Index 10\n-\tOrange triangular block: Index 15\n-   Green rectangular blocks (vertical): Index 5 (x2)\n-   Yellow rectangular block (horizontal): Index 8\n-   Blue rectangular block: Index 3\n\n## Assembly Order:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n}\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 15\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n}\n"

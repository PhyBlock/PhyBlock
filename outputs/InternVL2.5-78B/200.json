    "instruction": "<IMG_CONTEXT><IMG_CONTEXT>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

Yellow rectangular block (horizontal) with a red triangular block on top.\n2. Red rectangular block (horizontal) with a circular cutout.\n3. Green rectangular block (horizontal).\n4. Blue rectangular block (horizontal).\n5. Red triangular block.\n\n### List Block Indices:\n- **Yellow rectangular block (horizontal) with a red triangular block on top:** Index 10\n- **Red rectangular block (horizontal) with a circular cutout:** Index 1\n- **Green rectangular block (horizontal):** Index 5\n- **Blue rectangular block (horizontal):** Index 4\n- **Red triangular block:** Index 13\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\n### Inference of Order:\n1. **Base Layer:**\n   - Place three yellow rectangular blocks with red triangular blocks on top (Index 10).\n2. **Middle Layer:**\n   - Place the red rectangular block with a circular cutout (Index 1).\n   - Place the yellow rectangular block with a red triangular block on top (Index 10).\n3. **Top Layer:**\n   - Place the green rectangular block (Index 5).\n   - Place the blue rectangular block (Index 4).\n   - Place the red triangular block (Index 13).\n\n### Output Format:\n```json\n{\n   \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n   \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n   \"Step3"

    "instruction": "<|image_pad|><|image_pad|>## Task Overview:\nYou must construct a structure using building blocks based on visual input. Two images are provided:\n1.\tMain Target Image:\n   -\tDisplays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   -\tShows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2.\tBlock Dictionary Image:\n   -\tContains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   -\tEach sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1.\tAnalyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n   -\tCount & Layers: Determine how many blocks are used and how many layers the structure has.\n   -\tSpatial Relationships: Describe how the blocks are arranged relative to each other (e.g., which blocks are adjacent, above, or below one another).\n2.\tSelect the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n   -\tIdentify Needed Blocks: Based on your analysis, decide which blocks from the dictionary are required to match the target structure.\n   -\tList Block Indices: Provide a list of the corresponding block indices.\n   -\tMatching Criteria:\n   -\tThe chosen blocks must match the target image exactly in shape, color, and rotational orientation.\n   -\tImportant: You cannot rotate any block. Use the blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n   -\tThe same block index may be used multiple times if needed.\n   -\tExample: If the main image shows a green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation, you must select the horizontally oriented green rectangular block from the dictionary—not the vertical one.\n3.\tDetermine the Assembly Order:\n   -\tInference of Order: Based on the selected blocks, infer a step-by-step assembly sequence.\n   -\tOutput Format: Use the following template for your instructions:\n      {\n         Step1: Move block with index {idx}\n         Step2: Move block with index {idx}\n         ...\n         Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n      }\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n   -\tDetailed Analysis: Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n   -\tExact Matching: Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n   -\tClear Assembly Instructions: Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely.\n",

    "predict": "### Main Target Image Analysis\n\nThe main target image shows a structure composed of the following blocks:\n- **Red**: A red rectangular block.\n- **Green**: A green rectangular block.\n- **Blue**: A blue rectangular block.\n- **Yellow**: A yellow rectangular block.\n- **Orange**: An orange triangular block.\n\nThe structure has the following layers:\n1. The top layer consists of a red block on top of a green block.\n2. The middle layer consists of a blue block on top of a yellow block.\n3. The bottom layer consists of two green blocks.\n\nThe spatial relationships are as follows:\n- The red block is directly on top of the green block.\n- The blue block is directly on top of the yellow block.\n- The yellow block is directly on top of the green block.\n- The green blocks are directly below the blue and yellow blocks.\n\n### Block Dictionary Image Analysis\n\nThe block dictionary image contains the following sub-images:\n1. **Block 1**: A blue rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n2. **Block 2**: A green rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n3. **Block 3**: A red rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n4. **Block 4**: A yellow rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n5. **Block 5**: A green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n6. **Block 6**: A blue rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n7. **Block 7**: A yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n8. **Block 8**: A green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n9. **Block 9**: A yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n10. **Block 10**: A red rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n11. **Block 11**: An orange triangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n12. **Block 12**: An orange triangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n13. **Block 13**: An orange triangular block in a vertical orientation.\n14. **Block 14**: An orange triangular block in a vertical orientation.\n15. **Block 15**: An orange triangular block in a vertical orientation.\n16. **Block 16**: An orange triangular block in a vertical orientation.\n\n### Required Blocks Selection\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are:\n- **Red**: Block 3\n- **Green**: Block 2, Block 5, Block 7\n- **Blue**: Block 6\n- **Yellow**:"

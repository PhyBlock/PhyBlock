There are two tall, cylindrical orange blocks supporting the structure. The middle layer is composed of a red rectangular block, a yellow arched block, and another red block. The top layer includes a small orange triangular block. The spatial relationships are as follows: the orange cylinders are on the bottom, directly supporting the middle layer of blocks. The red rectangular block is directly in front of and on top of the orange cylinders. The curved yellow block is positioned on top of the red block, and a second red block is on the top right of the curved yellow block. Finally, the orange triangular roof sits on top of the second red block.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the image, the following block indices are required to replicate the target structure:\n\n* **Block 1:** Red Arch\n* **Block 2:** Red Rectangular\n* **Block 4:** Orange Triangle\n* **Block 5:** Yellow Rectangular\n* **Block 6:** Orange Cylinder\n* **Block 7:** Yellow Half-Arch\n* **Block 13:** Red Rectangular\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 6\nStep2: Move block with index 6\nStep3: Move block with index 13\nStep4: Move block with index 5\nStep5: Move block with index 7\nStep6: Move block with index 2\nStep7: Move block with index 1\nStep8: Move block with index 1\nStep9: Move block with index 4\n}\n"

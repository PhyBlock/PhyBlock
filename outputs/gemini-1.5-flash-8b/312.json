            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main image shows a structure composed of various colored rectangular and triangular blocks. There are at least 10 different blocks.  The structure has multiple layers.  A detailed spatial analysis is needed to describe the layout fully.  Components are arranged in a roughly L-shape.  Clearly identifiable blocks include:\n\n* **Structure A:** A base composed of red rectangular blocks, with a red arch-like shape on top of it. A few smaller blocks (green, blue, and orange) sit above the base.\n\n* **Structure B:** A rectangular block structure with a section removed to create a doorway or a hollow space.  The structure is composed of red, green, and yellow blocks.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the visual analysis, the following blocks from the dictionary are required, and their corresponding indices are:\n\n\n| Structure Part | Block Index |\n|---|---|\n| Structure A Base | 1 |\n| Structure A Base | 6 |\n| Structure A Base | 6 |\n| Structure A Base | 6 |\n| Structure A Arch  | 1 |\n| Structure A Top Green | 9 |\n| Structure A Top Blue | 4 |\n| Structure A Top Orange | 15 |\n| Structure B Vertical | 9 |\n| Structure B Vertical | 11 |\n| Structure B Horizontal | 14 |\n| Structure B Horizontal | 7 |\n| Structure B Blue | 4 |\n\n\n**Important**: This list assumes the visual analysis is accurate.  Additional indices may be needed for full accuracy.\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 6, place it to the right of the block with index 1\nStep3: Move block with index 6, place it beside block index 6, in the row\nStep4: Move block with index 6, place it beside block index 6, in the row\nStep5: Move block with index 1, place it on top of the block with index 6  (to form the arch)\nStep6: Move block with index 9, place it to the top of the  arch-like formation.\nStep7: Move block with index 4, place it beside block with index 9.\nStep8: Move block with index 15, place it on top of block with index 4.\nStep9: Move block with index 9, place it to the left of Structure A, and stacked above the red blocks.\nStep10: Move block with index 11, place it on the right of block index 9\nStep11: Move block with index 14, place it to the right of the vertical block 11\nStep12: Move block with index 7, place it beside block index 14.\nStep13: Move block with index 4, place it in the opening of the structure to complete the structure B.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n**Note:** This assembly sequence is a high-level representation.  A more detailed sequence would likely be needed to provide explicit placement and orientation of blocks if this was for an actual construction project.   Further clarity on the specific spatial relationships between blocks (e.g., front, back, left, right in three dimensions) is needed to refine the order."

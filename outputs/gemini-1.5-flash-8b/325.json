It has a hollowed-out middle section formed by blocks. The base is made of a large, reddish-orange/coral cylindrical block.  The top has a light orange/tan arch-like structure.\n\n   **Structure 2 (Animal/Creature):** This structure has a base of a reddish-orange/coral cylindrical block.  There are three other blocks on top of it: a yellowish-orange rectangular block, a blue square block, and a green rectangular block. Finally, a reddish-orange block with a curved top sits atop that.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1 (Tower):**\n   * Block 10: Reddish-orange cylinder (base)\n   * Block 1: Reddish-orange arch (middle)\n   * Block 2: Reddish-orange arch (middle)\n   * Block 9: Yellowish-orange rectangular block (middle)\n   * Block 1: Reddish-orange arch (top)\n\n\n\n   **Structure 2 (Animal/Creature):**\n   * Block 10: Reddish-orange cylinder (base)\n   * Block 6: Red Square Block\n   * Block 7: Yellow Block\n   * Block 8: Green Block\n   * Block 4: Reddish-orange curved top block\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10 to the surface\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1 to the top of block 10 (to build the first arch).\",\n     \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9 to the top of block 1.\",\n      \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2 to the top of block 9 (to complete the arch).\",\n      \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1 to the top of block 2.\",\n      \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10 to the surface (base of second structure).\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6 to the top of block 10.\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 7 to the right of block 6 on top of 10.\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 8 to the right of block 7 on top of 10.\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 4 to the top of the previously assembled blocks.\"\n\n}\n```\n"

The structure on the right is a small house-shaped structure consisting of 3 blocks in 2 layers.\n\nSpatial relationships:\n- **Left Structure:**\n    - The base of the tower is composed of a red rectangular block (likely block # 1 or a similar one).\n    - A red archway block (block #2) sits on top of that base.\n    - A second, smaller rectangular red block (likely #1) is placed on top of the archway.\n    - A red triangular roof block is placed on top of the second rectangular block.\n    - Finally, a smaller yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the archway, which serves as an intermediate layer.\n\n- **Right Structure:**\n    - A red rectangular block forms the base of the house.\n    - A green triangular block rests on the top right side of the red block\n    - A yellow rectangular block rests on the bottom right side of the red block.\n    - A red triangular roof block is on top of the structure.\n\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Left Structure Blocks:**\n\n* Block Index 1 (red rectangular block) - 2 times\n* Block Index 2 (red archway block) - 1 time\n* Block Index 13 (yellow rectangular block) - 1 time\n\n\n**Right Structure Blocks:**\n\n* Block Index 1 (red rectangular block) - 1 time\n* Block Index 10 (green triangular block) - 1 time\n* Block Index 9 (yellow rectangular block) - 1 time\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n   \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n\n}\n```\n\n**Left Structure Assembly Order (More Detailed):**\n\n1. Place block 1 (red rectangle) on the surface.\n2. Place block 2 (red arch) on top of block 1.\n3. Place block 13 (yellow rectangle) on top of block 2.\n4. Place block 1 (red rectangle) on top of block 13.\n5. Place block 1 (red rectangle) on top of the previous block.\n\n\n**Right Structure Assembly Order (More Detailed):**\n\n1. Place block 1 (red rectangle) on the surface.\n2. Place block 10 (green triangle) on the right side of block 1.\n3. Place block 9 (yellow rectangle) on the left side of block 1.\n4. Place block 1 (red triangle) on top of block 1,10,9\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact positions in the above steps are implied from the diagram, but they need to be confirmed from an exact 3D model and the specific orientation of the blocks within the dictionary image. The steps, as shown, will help build the structure. More steps are required to build more complex structures, including those that use different blocks."

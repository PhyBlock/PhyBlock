The blocks are arranged in a triangular shape, with one block on the bottom, two on the second layer, and two on the top layer.\n\n\n   **Structure 2 (Fork Shape):**  Composed of 5 blocks. It has 3 layers. The arrangement forms a fork-like shape with a vertical rectangular block supporting two vertical rectangular blocks which are angled outward.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1:**\n   - Block Index 9 (Orange Triangular Block) *2*\n   - Block Index 13 (Orange Triangular Block)*2*\n   - Block Index 2 (Green Rectangular Block)\n\n    **Structure 2:**\n   - Block Index 6 (Orange Cylindrical Block)\n   - Block Index 3 (Green Rectangular Block) *2*\n   - Block Index 10 (Orange Triangular Block) *1*\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   **Structure 1 (Triangular Shape):**\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 9\n        Step2: Move block with index 13\n        Step3: Move block with index 13 on top of 9\n        Step4: Move block with index 2 on top of 13\n        Step5: Move block with index 13 next to 2 on second layer\n     }\n\n   **Structure 2 (Fork Shape):**\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 6\n        Step2: Move block with index 3\n        Step3: Move block with index 3 on top of 6\n        Step4: Move block with index 10 next to block 3 on top of block 6\n        Step5: Move block with index 3 next to 10 on top of block 6\n     }\n"

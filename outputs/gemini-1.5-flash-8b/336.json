            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n   The target image shows a structure built from various blocks. There are three distinct sections.  A small house-like structure (red, orange, and green blocks) is located on the left.  A double-layer structure (red curved blocks and a blue cube) is in the middle.  On the right is a simple structure made from a yellow rectangle and two orange cylinders.\n\n\n   * **Block Count:**  At least 9 blocks (possibly more, depending on the number of pieces in the double structure).\n   * **Layers:** The structure has multiple layers, with different block stacks to create the shapes.\n   * **Spatial Relationships:** The blocks are arranged in vertical stacks and horizontal groups.  The  red curved blocks support the blue cube in the middle structure. The orange cylinder and yellow rectangle form a base on the right.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:** Based on visual analysis of the target image and block dictionary, the following blocks are required:\n\n\n   * **List of Block Indices:**\n     1. Block 3 (red curved block)\n     2. Block 5 (blue cube)\n     3. Block 6 (green block)\n     4. Block 14 (orange rectangular block)\n     5. Block 13 (red rectangular block)\n     6. Block 9 (yellow rectangle)\n     7. Block 11 (orange cylinder)\n     8. Block 1 (red curved block, for the second layer structure)\n     9. Block 14 (orange rectangular block)\n     10. Block 3 (red curved block)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 3 (on top of block 1)\n   Step3: Move block with index 5 (on top of block 3)\n   Step4: Move block with index 6 (on top of block 5)\n   Step5: Move block with index 14 (on top of the red arch in the middle)\n   Step6: Move block with index 13 (next to block 14 in the middle structure)\n   Step7: Move block with index 1 (for the second layer of the middle structure)\n   Step8: Move block with index 14 (on top of block 1 in the middle structure)\n   Step9: Move block with index 3 (on top of the red curved block in the middle structure)\n   Step10: Move block with index 9 (as the base of the structure on the right)\n   Step11: Move block with index 11 (on top of the yellow rectangle block on the right)\n   Step12: Move block with index 11 (second orange cylinder on top of the first orange cylinder)\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:** The exact placement of the block indices in the 'middle structure'  might be slightly ambiguous from the images provided without 3D modelling. This analysis focuses on identifying the visible blocks to assemble the structure and their approximate placement."

The structure has a bridge-like appearance with supporting pillars. The blocks are different colors (red, blue, yellow, green, orange) and have various shapes (rectangles, curves). Spatial relationships include blocks stacked vertically, blocks positioned side-by-side, and a series of blocks positioned to create a bridge-like arch.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the target image, the following blocks from the dictionary are required:\n\n*   Block Indices: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 5, 9, 11, 13, 4\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 2 on top of block 1.\n  Step3: Move block with index 3 on top of block 2\n  Step4: Move block with index 6 next to block 3 in the first layer\n  Step5: Move block with index 7  on top of block 6\n  Step6: Move block with index 5 on top of block 3\n  Step7: Move block with index 9 next to block 7 in the second layer\n  Step8: Move block with index 11 next to block 9 in the second layer\n  Step9: Move block with index 13 on top of block 9\n  Step10: Move block with index 4  next to block 11 in the second layer.\n}"

The second is a small tower-like structure with a base of four orange blocks.  \n\n   * **Structure 1 (House):**  It has 6 blocks in 3 layers. The spatial arrangement is:  a triangular base of two orange blocks, then a block with a rectangular hole (1 layer). This is then topped by a small triangular green block and a small square blue block; atop that is another triangle, orange.\n\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Tower):** This structure has 4 blocks in 2 layers. The orange blocks form a base, oriented at a 45Â° angle, with 4 identical orange blocks. This base is then topped with a single vertical triangular orange block resting on the 4 orange blocks.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (House):**\n      - Block Index 13 (orange triangle)\n      - Block Index 5 (blue square)\n      - Block Index 4 (green rectangle)\n      - Block Index 1 (red arch)\n\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Tower):**\n      - Block Index 13 (orange triangle)\n      - Block Index 1 (orange arch) (x4)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (House):**\n     {\n        Step1: Move block with index 13\n        Step2: Move block with index 13 next to block index 13\n        Step3: Move block with index 1 next to block index 13\n        Step4: Move block with index 4 above block index 1\n        Step5: Move block with index 5 above block index 4\n        Step6: Move block with index 13 atop block index 13 and 13\n     }\n\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Tower):**\n     {\n        Step1: Move block with index 1\n        Step2: Move block with index 1 next to block index 1\n        Step3: Move block with index 1 next to block index 1\n        Step4: Move block with index 1 next to block index 1\n        Step5: Move block with index 13 atop block index 1, 1, 1, 1\n     }"

It has 2-3 layers depending on how you view the tunnel block.\n   - Structure 2 (tower/bridge):  Consists of at least 5 blocks and 2-3 layers, depending on the way the support block is considered.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   The following block indices are needed (Structure 1):\n\n   * **Structure 1:**\n     * Block 1 (curved)\n     * Block 13 (orange rectangular)\n     * Block 14 (triangular)\n     * Block 13 (orange rectangular)\n     * Block 5 (curved)\n     * Block 14 (triangular)\n     * Block 15 (triangular)\n\n   * **Structure 2:**\n     * Block 10 (yellow rectangular)\n     * Block 13 (orange rectangular)\n     * Block 3 (red rectangular)\n     * Block 13 (orange rectangular)\n     * Block 3 (red rectangular)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14 on top of block 13\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5 to the left and below block 13 and 14\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1 to the right of block 5, and to the right of block 13 and 14\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13 on top of block 5\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14 on top of block 13\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13 on top of block 1 and partially overlapping it\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 15 on top of blocks 13 and 14\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 13 on top of block 10\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 3 to the right of block 10, and on a lower level\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 13 on top of block 3\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 3 on the right side of block 13 and 10\",\n  \"Step14\":\"Move block with index 13 on top of block 3\",\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact assembly order for the structures 1 and 2 is difficult to determine from the given 2D images alone.  This example offers a *possible* interpretation and assembly.  The best way to determine the proper sequence would require 3D visualization capabilities or a more explicit 3D drawing.  Additionally, the structure labels are a challenge due to the lack of visual cues within the dictionary itself."

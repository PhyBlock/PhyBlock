The first is a small house-like structure, and the second is a truck.\n   * **House Structure:**  It's composed of 6 blocks.  There are 3 layers.\n   * **Truck Structure:** It's composed of 6 blocks.  There are 3 layers.\n\n   The spatial relationships are as follows: the blocks are positioned in a way to form the respective structures, adjacent blocks touch each other vertically and horizontally.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **House Structure:**\n     - Block 1 (red arched block)\n     - Block 4 (red rectangular block)\n     - Block 13 (orange triangular block)\n     - Block 13 (orange triangular block)\n     - Block 5 (red rectangular block)\n     - Block 6 (blue rectangular block)\n\n\n   * **Truck Structure:**\n     - Block 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n     - Block 2 (blue square block)\n     - Block 4 (red rectangular block)\n     - Block 11 (orange cylindrical block)\n     - Block 11 (orange cylindrical block)\n     - Block 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"House Structure\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step 2: Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step 3: Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step 5: Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step 6: Move block with index 13\"\n\n\n  ],\n  \"Truck Structure\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step 2: Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step 3: Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step 5: Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step 6: Move block with index 4\"\n  ]\n}\n```"

The structure resembles a small archway. The first layer has two central, vertically-oriented, cylindrical blocks (yellow) supported by two shorter, rectangular blocks in front and behind them.  The second layer has a roof-like structure, with a triangular block (orange) on top, supporting an arch-shaped block (red) which in turn is supported by two square blocks (blue).  The structure also contains a separate triangular block (orange/red) located at the bottom-right.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the target image:\n\n* **Block 1 (yellow cylindrical):** x2\n* **Block 9 (yellow cylindrical):** x2\n* **Block 4 (blue square):** x2\n* **Block 3 (red arch-like):** x1\n* **Block 11 (orange triangular):** x1\n* **Block 13 (orange triangular):** x1\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 9 (yellow cylindrical)\nStep2: Move block with index 9 (yellow cylindrical)\nStep3: Move block with index 1 (yellow cylindrical)\nStep4: Move block with index 1 (yellow cylindrical)\nStep5: Move block with index 5 (red square)\nStep6: Move block with index 4 (blue square)\nStep7: Move block with index 4 (blue square)\nStep8: Move block with index 3 (red arch-like)\nStep9: Move block with index 11 (orange triangular)\nStep10: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular)\n```\n"

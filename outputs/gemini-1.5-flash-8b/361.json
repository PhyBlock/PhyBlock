Each layer consists of a pair of blocks:\n\n* **Layer 1:** Two yellow blocks with a circular cutout on one side (block type 1 or 2).\n* **Layer 2:** A red block (block type 1 or 2), and a green block (block type 9 or 10) stacked on top of the yellow blocks.  The red and green blocks are directly aligned.\n* **Layer 3:** A blue block (block type 7) stacked on top of the red block.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Block 2, Block 9, Block 7 (red tube), Block 11 (green block), Block 13 (yellow block)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 2\nStep2: Move block with index 13\nStep3: Move block with index 13\nStep4: Move block with index 11\nStep5: Move block with index 1\nStep6: Move block with index 7\nStep7: Move block with index 2\nStep8: Move block with index 13\nStep9: Move block with index 13\nStep10: Move block with index 11\nStep11: Move block with index 1\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The image is not perfectly clear for precise identification. A more definitive image would help assure that the indices selected and the order determined are accurate.  For instance, I have used index 1, 2, etc., which may be interpreted differently if the image or the dictionary of blocks were not as clear."

The bottom layer consists of two red arch-shaped blocks (2 and 3; possible rotations of one of the blocks would need to be considered). A yellow rectangular block (11) is placed on top of the two red arches.  A second, smaller structure sits to the left of the main structure.  This structure consists of a blue square block (7) and a yellow square block (8) positioned on top of each other.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Based on the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the target image, the following blocks are required:\n    * Block Index 2 (red arch-shaped)\n    * Block Index 3 (red arch-shaped)\n    * Block Index 11 (yellow rectangular)\n    * Block Index 7 (blue square)\n    * Block Index 8 (yellow square)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 2\nStep2: Move block with index 3\nStep3: Position block with index 11 on top of blocks 2 and 3\nStep4: Move block with index 7\nStep5: Position block with index 8 on top of block 7\n\n```"

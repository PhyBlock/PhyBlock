The structure on the right consists of 7 blocks arranged in 4 layers, the structure on the left consists of 4 blocks arranged in 3 layers. The blocks have various shapes (rectangular prisms, triangles, and cylinders) and colors (red, orange, green, blue, and yellow).  Spatial relationships: blocks are stacked vertically and positioned horizontally.  The positioning of each block within the structure is specific.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the blocks required to build the structure are as follows:\n\n| Structure Element | Block Index |\n|---|---|\n| Tower Structure (right): | 1 (x2), 2, 5, 6, 7, 13 |\n| Tower Structure (right): Small Triangle | 13 |\n| Small Triangle (left) | 15 |\n| Red Rectangular Prism (left) | 7 |\n| Green Rectangular Prism (left) | 6 |\n| Orange Rectangular Prism (left) | 7, 14 |\n| Yellow rectangular prism (tower structure) | 10 |\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 14\"  \n}\n```\n\n**Important Considerations/Notes:**\n\n* The assembly order is crucial to replicate the exact structure. A different order would result in a different configuration. The provided output is a high-level, generalized example, a precise visual matching would be required to produce the exact steps.\n*  Block indices are written in their correct order for the construction of the complete structure; the order within the smaller structures is arbitrary.\n* Visual reference for the precise index assignment is essential to assure the exact matching.\n*  The provided list may need to be adjusted.  A visual comparison between the target image and the dictionary would be necessary to create precise instructions.\n"

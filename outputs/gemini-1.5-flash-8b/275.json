The blocks are arranged to form a small house-like structure.\n   * **Structure 2 (Tower):** Consists of 9 blocks in 3 layers. This structure features cylindrical and other shaped blocks forming a tower-like form.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (House):**\n     * Block Index 3 (Blue Square)\n     * Block Index 7 (Green Rectangle)\n     * Block Index 5 (Red Square)\n     * Block Index 1 (Round Hollow Block)\n     * Block Index 6 (Yellow Rectangle)\n     * Block Index 14 (Red Triangular Block)\n\n\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Tower):**\n     * Block Index 11 (Orange Cylinder) * 3\n     * Block Index 1 (Round Hollow Block)\n     * Block Index 6 (Yellow Rectangle)\n     * Block Index 14 (Red Triangular Block)\n     * Block Index 5 (Red Square)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1 (House)\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 1 (Round Hollow Block)\",\n    \"Step 2: Move block with index 6 (Yellow Rectangle) on top of block 1\",\n    \"Step 3: Move block with index 3 (Blue Square) on top of block 6\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 7 (Green Rectangle) to the right of block 3\",\n    \"Step 5: Move block with index 14 (Red Triangular Block) on top of block 7 and 3\",\n    \"Step 6: Move block with index 5 (Red Square) below block 1\",\n\t\t\"Step 7: Move block with index 14 (Red Triangular Block) on top of Block 7\"\n\n\n  ],\n  \"Structure 2 (Tower)\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 11 (Orange Cylinder)\",\n    \"Step 2: Move block with index 11 (Orange Cylinder) on top of block 11\",\n    \"Step 3: Move block with index 11 (Orange Cylinder) on top of block 11\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 1 (Round Hollow Block) on top of block 11\",\n    \"Step 5: Move block with index 6 (Yellow Rectangle) on top of block 1\",\n    \"Step 6: Move block with index 14 (Red Triangular Block)  on top of block 6\",\n    \"Step 7: Move block with index 5 (Red Square) on top of block 14\",\n\t\t\"Step 8: Move block with index 11 (Orange Cylinder) on top of block 5\",\n\t\t\"Step 9: Move block with index 11 (Orange Cylinder) on top of block 11\"\n\n\n\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The assembly order is inferred from the images; it's possible there are multiple valid assembly sequences.  Without knowing the specific rules of the block-placing system (e.g., only one block can be placed per move), the precise order cannot be determined.  Also, I've assumed placing the block on the bottom/floor in the order they are needed. This is just one possible approach."

It is possible there are more hidden by others.\n   - **Layers:** The tower structure has 3 visible layers. The small structure has 3 layers as well.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:** The tower consists of a central support structure (yellow block) with two-red, one blue and one green blocks stacked above. A yellow block supports the structure on the bottom. The small structure has a curved piece on the bottom, a yellowish block in the middle, and a triangular red-orange block on top.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   - **Needed Blocks:** Based on the target image, the following blocks from the block dictionary are required:\n      - Block 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n      - Block 5 (red rectangular block)\n      - Block 3 (blue square block)\n      - Block 6 (green rectangular block)\n      - Block 14 (red rectangular block)\n      - Block 15 (red-orange triangular block)\n      - Block 10 (yellow curved block)\n\n   - **List of Block Indices:** 9, 5, 3, 6, 14, 15, 10\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5 on top of block 9\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3 on top of block 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6 on top of block 3\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14 next to block 9\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10 on top of block 14\",\n   \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 15 on top of block 10\",\n}\n```\n"

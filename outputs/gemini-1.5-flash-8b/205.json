The blocks are arranged in a vertical tree-like structure with some blocks positioned horizontally to create a sort of \"trunk\".\n\n   - **Structure 2 (Triangular):** Composed of at least 8 blocks, possibly more hidden. It has 3 layers. The blocks are arranged in a triangular shape with a hollow cylindrical/tube-shaped opening in the middle.\n\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   - **Structure 1 (Tree-like):**\n      - Block Index 9 (Green Vertical Rectangular Block)\n      - Block Index 10 (Yellow Horizontal Rectangular Block)\n      - Block Index 12 (Orange Cylindrical Block)\n      - Block Index 3 (Blue Cube)\n      - Block Index 4 (Green Inclined Rectangular Block)\n      - Block Index 1 (Red Inclined Rectangular Block)\n\n   - **Structure 2 (Triangular):**\n      - Block Index 13 (Orange Triangular Block)\n      - Block Index 3 (Blue Cube)\n      - Block Index 5 (Yellow Square Block)\n      - Block Index 10 (Yellow Horizontal Rectangular Block)\n      - Block Index 1(Red Inclined Rectangular Block)\n      - Block Index 8 (Green Square Block)\n      - Block Index 15 (Red Triangular Block)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1 (Tree-like)\": [\n    {\n      \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9 on top of block 12\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3 on top of block 9\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4 on top of block 3\"\n    },\n      {\n      \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10 to the right side of block 12\"\n    },\n       {\n      \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1 to the left of block 12\"\n    }\n\n  ],\n  \"Structure 2 (Triangular)\": [\n    {\n      \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 3 to the top of block 13\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5 to the left of block 3\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10 to the right of block 5\"\n    },\n         {\n      \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8 on top of block 10\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 15 on top of block 8\"\n    },\n   {\n      \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1 directly underneath block 10\"\n    },\n\n\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The provided images do not allow for a precise determination of which blocks are hidden. This solution assumes the visible blocks are the only ones to be considered for placement order.  Also, the assembly order is a possible interpretation; the actual stacking order in a real-world scenario could be different."

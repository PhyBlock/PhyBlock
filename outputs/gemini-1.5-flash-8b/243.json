Two orange/red blocks form the base, one yellow/gold block sits on top of those forming a column and then two similar-colored angled blocks forming the roof.  It appears to have 3 layers.\n\n* **Structure 2 (Bridge/Group):**  Composed of 7 blocks.  This structure consists of a base of orange/red blocks, a yellow arched block above them. Then a blue cube on the right edge. Further blocks stacked in a variety of colors and shapes. It seems to have 3 layers.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n| Structure 1 Block | Block Index |\n|---|---|\n| Orange/Red Base Block | 1 |\n| Second Orange/Red Base Block | 1 |\n| Yellow/Gold Column Block | 9 |\n| First Angled Orange/Red Roof Block | 13 |\n| Second Angled Orange/Red Roof Block | 13 |\n\n\n| Structure 2 Block | Block Index |\n|---|---|\n| Orange/Red Base Block | 1 |\n| Yellow/Gold Arch Block | 11 |\n| Blue Cube | 3 |\n| Red Block | 4 |\n| Green Block | 6 |\n| Yellow Block | 7|\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Tower):**\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 1\n  Step3: Move block with index 9\n  Step4: Move block with index 13\n  Step5: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\n**Structure 2 (Bridge/Group):**\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 1\n  Step3: Move block with index 11\n  Step4: Move block with index 3\n  Step5: Move block with index 4\n  Step6: Move block with index 6\n  Step7: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n"

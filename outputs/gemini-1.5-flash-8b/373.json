It appears to be composed of 6 blocks across 3 layers.\n\n* **Block Count:** 6 blocks\n* **Layers:** 3 layers\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * Layer 1:  A red block (index 1) with a curved opening is on the bottom.  A green block (index 5) is placed horizontally above it.\n    * Layer 2: A red block (index 1) with a curved opening is placed on top of the green block in the center. A yellow block (index 9) is vertically placed on top of the red block to the right, forming the second layer.\n    * Layer 3:  An orange triangular block (index 14) sits on top of the yellow block.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Based on the description, the following blocks from the dictionary are needed:\n    * Block Index 1 (red curved block)\n    * Block Index 5 (green block)\n    * Block Index 9 (yellow block)\n    * Block Index 14 (orange triangular block)\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5 on top of block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1 on top of block with index 5\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9 on top of block with index 1 (right)\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14 on top of block with index 9\"\n}\n```\n"

The blocks are a green rectangular prism, a red rectangular prism with a circular cutout, a blue square prism, and a green square prism.  The red block sits on the bottom layer. On top of that, the green rectangular block and the green square block sit adjacent to each other.  The blue block sits on top and is slightly offset.\n\n\n* **Structure 2 (Right):** This structure is a small vehicle. It uses 5 blocks: two orange cylindrical blocks, a yellow rectangular block, a blue square block, and an orange rectangular block. The yellow block sits in the middle and is horizontally oriented.  The two orange cylinder blocks sit below this yellow block on the bottom layer and are oriented horizontally.  The blue block sits directly above the yellow block in the middle; the orange rectangular block is atop the blue and yellow block, horizontally oriented.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure 1:**\n    * Block Index 6 (green rectangular block)\n    * Block Index 1 (red block with cutout)\n    * Block Index 5 (blue square block)\n    * Block Index 8 (green square block)\n\n* **Structure 2:**\n    * Block Index 13 (orange vertical rectangular block)\n    * Block Index 14 (yellow vertical block)\n    * Block Index 15 (orange rectangular block)\n    * Block Index 16 (orange cylindrical block) *2 (Note repetition needed)\n    * Block Index 4 (blue square block)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n   Step6: Move block with index 16\n   Step7: Move block with index 16\n   Step8: Move block with index 14\n   Step9: Move block with index 4\n   Step10: Move block with index 15\n}\n"

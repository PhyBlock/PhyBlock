A blue cube sits atop two other blue cubes in the middle of the structure.  A green block is positioned behind the blue cubes, and a yellow rectangular block is adjacent to a red block and a red triangular block, on the bottom layer. A yellow block with a curved section is present in the bottom layer too.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n\n   * Block 2 (Blue Cube) x 3\n   * Block 5 (Green L-shaped block)\n   * Block 9 (Yellow Rectangular block)\n   * Block 10 (Orange Triangular block)\n   * Block 13 (Orange curved block)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 9\n      Step2: Move block with index 13\n      Step3: Move block with index 10\n      Step4: Move block with index 5\n      Step5: Move block with index 2\n      Step6: Move block with index 2\n      Step7: Move block with index 2\n   }\n   ```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact order of the *first three* steps (placing the bottom layer) is somewhat arbitrary, and the image doesn't provide enough depth information to determine the precise order with certainty, as long as the blocks are correctly arranged on the bottom layer. The next steps (constructing the middle and top layers) can only be determined by visual inspection of the target image.  Steps 5-7 establish the middle-layer blue blocks atop the yellow blocks."

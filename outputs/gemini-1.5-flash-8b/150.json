Blocks are arranged with some stacked, some adjacent to create a triangular shape at the top with a curved (arch-shaped) block underneath.\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Camel-like):** This structure consists of 5 blocks, in 3 layers. Two blocks are used for legs, one cylinder is in the middle, one more cylinder at the top, and one arch-shaped block.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (House-like):**\n      * Block Index 4 (Blue Square)\n      * Block Index 5 (Green Rectangular)\n      * Block Index 1 (Red Arch)\n      * Block Index 6 (Red Rectangular)\n      * Block Index 15 (Red Triangular)\n      * Block Index 14 (Orange Triangular)\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Camel-like):**\n      * Block Index 13 (Yellow Cylinder)\n      * Block Index 11 (Orange Cylinder)\n      * Block Index 9 (Yellow Rectangular)\n      * Block Index 5 (Green Rectangular)\n      * Block Index 1 (Red Arch)\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1 (House-like)\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 1 (Red Arch)\",\n    \"Step 2: Move block with index 5 (Green Rectangular) on top of block 1\",\n    \"Step 3: Move block with index 4 (Blue Square) on top of block 5\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 6 (Red Rectangular) to the left of block 5\",\n    \"Step 5: Move block with index 15 (Red Triangular) on top of block 6\",\n    \"Step 6: Move block with index 14 (Orange Triangular) on top of block 15 (at the right of the top triangle)\"\n  ],\n  \"Structure 2 (Camel-like)\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 9 (Yellow Rectangular)\",\n    \"Step 2: Move block with index 5 (Green Rectangular) on top of block 9\",\n\t\"Step 3: Move block with index 5 (Green Rectangular) on top of the first green rectangular block\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 11 (Orange Cylinder) on top of the previous 5\",\n    \"Step 5: Move block with index 13 (Yellow Cylinder)  to the left of block 9\",\n    \"Step 6: Move block with index 1 (Red Arch) on top of the 11\"\n  ]\n}\n```"

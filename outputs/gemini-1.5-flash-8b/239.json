There are two layers. The orange blocks form a central vertical section, with the green blocks flanking it. Atop the orange blocks is a small, triangular-shaped orange block.\n\n   **Structure 2 (right):** Composed of 4 blocks. 1 is a red block with a concave opening, 1 is a green block, 1 is a blue block, and 1 is a light orange block. There is one layer. The red block sits on the bottom with the green on the top right, then the blue above the green (shifted slightly to the left), and the orange block on top, right of the green block.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1:**\n   * Block 10 (orange rectangular prism): 2\n   * Block 5 (light green rectangular prism): 2\n   * Block 13 (orange triangular prism): 1\n\n\n   **Structure 2:**\n   * Block 1 (red block with concave opening): 1\n   * Block 3 (green rectangular prism): 1\n   * Block 2 (blue rectangular prism): 1\n   * Block 9 (orange cylinder): 1\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   **Structure 1:**\n   ```\n   Step1: Move block with index 10\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 13\n   ```\n\n   **Structure 2:**\n   ```\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 9\n   ```\n"

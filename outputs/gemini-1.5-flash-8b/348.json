A green cube sits on top of the yellow block. A red block sits next to the blue cube. The structure is capped with a horizontal orange triangular block.\n\n   **Structure 2 (Tower):**\n   * Block Count: 6\n   * Layers: 3\n   * Spatial Relationships: An orange cylinder forms the base, with a pair of orange triangular blocks on either side (leaning). Two blue rectangular blocks are placed one above the other on the orange cylinder. Another orange triangular block sits atop the vertical blue blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1 (House):**\n   * Block 5 (Green Cube)\n   * Block 6 (Blue Cube)\n   * Block 7 (Yellow Rectangular Block)\n   * Block 13 (Red Rectangular Block)\n   * Block 1 (Orange Triangular Block)\n\t\n\t\n   **Structure 2 (Tower):**\n   * Block 10 (Orange Cylinder)\n   * Block 6 (Blue Rectangular Block)\n   * Block 14 (Orange Triangular Block)\n   * Block 15 (Orange Triangular Block)\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   **Structure 1 (House):**\n   ```\n   Step1: Move block with index 7 (Yellow Rectangular Block)\n   Step2: Move block with index 6 (Blue Cube) next to the yellow block\n   Step3: Move block with index 13 (Red Rectangular Block) next to the blue block.\n   Step4: Move block with index 5 (Green Cube) on top of the yellow block\n   Step5: Move block with index 1 (Orange Triangular Block) on top of the green and red blocks\n   ```\n\n\n   **Structure 2 (Tower):**\n   ```\n   Step1: Move block with index 10 (Orange Cylinder)\n   Step2: Move block with index 14 (Orange Triangular Block) beside the orange cylinder\n   Step3: Move block with index 15 (Orange Triangular Block) beside the orange cylinder on the other side\n   Step4: Move block with index 6 (Blue Rectangular Block) on top of the orange cylinder\n   Step5: Move block with index 6 (Another Blue Rectangular Block) on top of the first blue block\n   Step6: Move block with index 1 (Orange Triangular Block) on top of the two blue blocks.\n\n   ```\n"

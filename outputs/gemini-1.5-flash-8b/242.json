Let's analyze each.\n\n   **Structure 1 (Vehicle):**  Composed of 5 blocks.  It has two layers.  The bottom layer has two cylindrical blocks. The top layer has 3 blocks arranged atop the cylinders (a square, a curved block, and a square).\n\n   **Structure 2 (Creature):**  Composed of 7 blocks. It has three layers. The base is a vertical, cylindrical block. On top of that is a triangular block, and then a combination of 4 additional blocks. The arrangement forms a creature-like shape.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1 (Vehicle):**\n     - Block 9 (Red Cylinder): 2\n     - Block 3 (Blue Square): 1\n     - Block 2 (Red Curved): 1\n     - Block 4 (Yellow Square): 1\n\n\n   **Structure 2 (Creature):**\n     - Block 10 (Red Cylinder): 1\n     - Block 13 (Red Triangle): 1\n     - Block 5 (Green Long): 1\n     - Block 3 (Blue Square): 1\n     - Block 4 (Yellow Square): 1\n     - Block 1 (Red Curved): 1\n     - Block 1 (Red Curved): 1\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   **Structure 1 (Vehicle):**\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n}\n\n\n   **Structure 2 (Creature):**\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 10\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n}\n"

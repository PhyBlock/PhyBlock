The blocks are a blue cube, a green rectangular prism, a red curved block (similar to a trough), and a light orange/tan rectangular prism (the roof). The blocks are arranged in a stacked configuration.\n\n* **Structure 2 (Right):**  This structure is a rocket shape and consists of 9 blocks in 3 layers.  The blocks are various shades of red, a tan/yellow curved block, and a triangular block.  The blocks are arranged to create the rocket's body, cone top, and the rounded parts.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the main image and dictionary, the following block indices are required:\n\n* **Structure 1:**\n    * Block 1 (red curved block)\n    * Block 5 (green rectangular prism)\n    * Block 4 (blue cube)\n    * Block 10 (light yellow/tan rectangular prism)\n    * Block 13 (red slanted block)\n\n* **Structure 2:**\n\t* Block 3 (red curved block)\n\t* Block 13 (red slanted block) *x2*\n\t* Block 15 (tan curved block) *x2*\n\t* Block 10 (light yellow/tan rectangular prism)\n\t* Block 14 (red triangular block) *x1*\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 10\",\n\t\"Step 2: Move block with index 1\",\n\t\"Step 3: Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step 5: Move block with index 13\"\n  ],\n  \"Structure 2\": [\n    \"Step 1: Move block with index 13\",\n\t\"Step 2: Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step 3: Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step 4: Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step 5: Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step 6: Move block with index 15\",\n\t\"Step 7: Move block with index 14\"\n  ]\n}\n```"

The blocks are a combination of rectangular prism (green, orange), and cylindrical shapes (orange). The blocks in each layer are arranged in a slightly offset, symmetrical fashion, forming a tower-like structure with hollowed openings in the middle.  The smaller structure on the right is composed of 4 blocks in 2 layers. It is a smaller house-like shape with a triangular roof.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the target image:\n\n\n* **Tower Structure:**\n    * Block 5 (green rectangular prism) x 3\n    * Block 9 (orange cylindrical prism) x 3\n    * Block 13 (orange triangular prism) x 2\n    * Block 8 (yellow rectangular prism) x 1\n\n\n* **Small Structure:**\n    * Block 1 (green rectangular prism) x 1\n    * Block 3 (red rectangular prism) x 1\n    * Block 4 (yellow rectangular prism) x 1\n    * Block 13 (orange triangular prism) x 1\n\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\n\n\n* **Tower:** 5, 9, 13, 8\n* **Small structure:** 1, 3, 4, 13\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 9\nStep2: Move block with index 5\nStep3: Move block with index 9\nStep4: Move block with index 5\nStep5: Move block with index 13\nStep6: Move block with index 9\nStep7: Move block with index 5\nStep8: Move block with index 13\nStep9: Move block with index 8\nStep10: Move block with index 5\nStep11: Move block with index 1 (small structure)\nStep12: Move block with index 3 (small structure)\nStep13: Move block with index 4 (small structure)\nStep14: Move block with index 13 (small structure)\n\n```\n"

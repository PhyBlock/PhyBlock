Structure 1 has 4 layers, while Structure 2 has 5.  A total of 10 different blocks are used.  The blocks are arranged in a combination of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal positions, creating various shapes and heights.  Spatial relationships are complex, with blocks stacked vertically, horizontally, and diagonally offset.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** The structures use various rectangular, triangular, and curved blocks in different colors.\n\n* **List of Block Indices:**\n    * Structure 1: 3, 4, 5, 6, 13\n    * Structure 2: 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 12, 15\n  \n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n\"Structure 1\": [\n  {\"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\"},\n  {\"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\"},\n  {\"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\"},\n  {\"Step4\": \"Move block with index 3\"},\n  {\"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\"},\n ],\n\"Structure 2\": [\n  {\"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\"},\n  {\"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\"},\n  {\"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\"},\n  {\"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\"},\n  {\"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\"},\n  {\"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\"},\n  {\"Step7\": \"Move block with index 15\"},\n  ]\n\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The exact order of placement within each structure is not fully determined by the provided images and may not be unique. For example, the \"3\" block could be on top of the \"6\" block on structure 1 or vice versa.  The above represents a *possible* assembly sequence. Without further spatial constraints within the provided images, other valid assembly sequences could exist.  Also, \"Move\" is used generically as the actual action might be more specific (place, position, align etc.).\n"

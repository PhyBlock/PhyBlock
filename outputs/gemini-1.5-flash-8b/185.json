There are three main layers.\n\n- **Layer 1 (Base):**  Four large orange/red cylindrical blocks form the base.\n- **Layer 2:**  Two red arched blocks, two green rectangular blocks, and two yellow rectangular blocks.\n- **Layer 3:** A yellow, top rectangular block, a blue square block, a green square block, and a yellow curved block.\n\n\nThe blocks are arranged in specific positions and orientations relative to each other, forming the final structure.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the target image's block shapes, colors, and orientations, the following block indices are required:\n\n\n| Block Description                                   | Block Index |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Red Arch Block (layer 2)                              | 1, 2         |\n| Green Rectangle Block (layer 2)                         | 5, 7           |\n| Yellow Rectangle Block (layer 2)                     | 6, 8            |\n| Orange/Red Cylinder Block (layer 1)                     | 11, 11, 11, 11     |\n| Yellow Top Block (layer 3)                            | 13, 14, 14  |\n| Blue Square Block (layer 3)                           | 3                |\n| Green Square Block (layer 3)                           | 4                |\n| Yellow Curved Block (layer 3)                        | 13        |\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 11\nStep2: Move block with index 11\nStep3: Move block with index 11\nStep4: Move block with index 11\nStep5: Move block with index 2\nStep6: Move block with index 1\nStep7: Move block with index 5\nStep8: Move block with index 7\nStep9: Move block with index 6\nStep10: Move block with index 8\nStep11: Move block with index 13\nStep12: Move block with index 3\nStep13: Move block with index 4\nStep14: Move block with index 14\nStep15: Move block with index 13\nStep16: Move block with index 14\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The specific stacking order is critical to creating the final structure. This list is a sequence that successfully creates the structure shown.  Without a clear visual representation of the blocks' placement, the specific position (e.g., left to right, front to back) of each block can't be perfectly articulated in a 2D layout.  The precise layering and positioning of the blocks is inherent in this output, but a 3D model would be most helpful to completely understand the exact order of blocks.\n"

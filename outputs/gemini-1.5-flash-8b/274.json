Let's focus on the structure on the right.\n\n   * **Block Count:**  There are at least 6 blocks visible in the structure.  Parts of additional blocks may be hidden.\n   * **Layers:**  The structure has 3 layers.\n   * **Spatial Relationships:**\n      - The base layer consists of a single, vertically oriented, green block (likely block #10).\n      - On top of the green block, a yellow rectangular block (likely block #10) is placed horizontally.\n      - On top of the yellow block, an orange triangular block (likely block #14) is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block. This block is positioned so that the right side of its triangle is aligned with the right side of the yellow block. \n      - A second orange triangular block (likely block #14) rests on top of the first one, placed so that the left side of the triangle is aligned with the yellow block.\n      -  A reddish-orange rectangular block (likely block #13) is positioned on top of the pair of orange triangular blocks.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:** Based on the visual analysis, the following blocks are required:\n     * Block #10 (Green Rectangular)\n     * Block #13 (Reddish Orange Rectangular)\n     * Block #14 (Orange Triangular, two needed)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10\nStep2: Move block with index 13\nStep3: Move block with index 14\nStep4: Move block with index 14 \n}\n```"

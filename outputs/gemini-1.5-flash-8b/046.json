There are 9 blocks total, arranged in three layers.  The structure has a small triangular roof-like element on top.  The columns are composed of green, orange-red, and yellow blocks.  The spatial relationships are:\n   * The two tall vertical blocks are in the middle and are supported by rectangular blocks below them.\n   * The roof is placed on top of the vertical blocks.\n   * The yellow rectangular blocks are at the base of each column, beneath the tall vertical blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:**  Based on the colors and shapes, the following blocks are needed from the dictionary:\n   * Block 1 (green vertical)\n   * Block 2 (same as Block 1 - green vertical)\n   * Block 6 (orange-red vertical)\n   * Block 6 (same as Block 6 - orange-red vertical)\n   * Block 3 (green horizontal)\n   * Block 3 (same as Block 3 - green horizontal)\n   * Block 5 (yellow horizontal)\n   * Block 5 (same as Block 5 - yellow horizontal)\n   * Block 13 (orange-red triangle)\n\n\n   * **List of Block Indices:** 1, 2, 6, 6, 3, 3, 5, 5, 13\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n}\n```\n"

Let's analyze them separately:\n\n   **Structure 1 (Lower Left):**\n   * **Blocks:** 4 blocks\n   * **Layers:** 2\n   * **Spatial Relationships:** Two triangular blocks (orange, index 13) form the base, with a square block (green, index 5) placed on top of the intersection of the triangles. Another square block (blue, index 9) is placed atop the green block.\n\n   **Structure 2 (Upper Right):**\n   * **Blocks:** 9 blocks\n   * **Layers:** 3\n   * **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is built up in layers.   A semi-circular block (index 1) forms the base.  A red triangular block (index 13) is directly above the semi-circular block.  Another red triangular block is placed directly adjacent, atop the other triangular block, and then a green square block (index 5) is placed on top of those. A blue square block (index 4) is placed on top of the green block to the right. More red, yellow, and blue blocks are placed on top, following the pattern of the lower structure.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1:**\n   * Block 13 (orange triangle) x 2\n   * Block 5 (green square)\n   * Block 9 (blue square)\n\n   **Structure 2:**\n   * Block 1 (red semi-circle)\n   * Block 13 (red triangle) x 2\n   * Block 5 (green square)\n   * Block 4 (blue square)\n   * Block 12 (yellow square)\n   * Block 10 (orange square)\n   * Block 7 (blue square)\n\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   **Structure 1:**\n   ```\n   Step1: Move block with index 13\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 9\n   ```\n\n   **Structure 2:**\n   ```\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 13\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 7\n   ```\n"

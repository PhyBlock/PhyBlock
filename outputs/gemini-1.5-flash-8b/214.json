The left section appears to be a small tower/house structure. The right section is a pair of stacked/supporting cylindrical blocks with a horizontal rectangular block across them.\n   \n   - **Block Count:**  At least 10 distinct blocks are visible.  A precise count is difficult without knowing if unseen blocks are hidden behind others.\n   - **Layers:** The structure has multiple layers, particularly evident in the tower section.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:**  The blocks are arranged in a variety of ways: stacked vertically, horizontally aligned, nested/interlocking in the arched section of the left tower. The two pillars are positioned next to the tower, with the horizontal rectangular block supported by them.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Needed Blocks:** Based on visual comparison, these blocks from the dictionary are needed to recreate the image:\n\n\n   - **Block 1 (Red Arch):**  Used multiple times.\n   - **Block 6 (Blue Cube):**\n   - **Block 7 (Green Cube):**\n   - **Block 10 (Green Rectangle):**\n   - **Block 13 (Orange Cylinder):** Used multiple times.\n   - **Block 9 (Red Rectangle):**\n   - **Block 2 (Red Arch):**\n    -**Block 11 (Rectangular Block):**\n   - **Block 14 (Orange Rectangle):**\n\n   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 6 on top of block index 1\nStep4: Move block with index 7 on top of block index 6\nStep5: Move block with index 9 in the middle, and under the 1 and 2 arches.\nStep6: Move block with index 10 across the top of 1 & 2 block arches.\nStep7: Move block with index 13\nStep8: Move block with index 13 again\nStep9: Move block with index 14 across top of block index 13s\nStep10: Move block with index 11 on top of blocks 13\n```\n"

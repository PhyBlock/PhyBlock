The blocks are arranged in a slightly asymmetrical configuration.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:** Based on visual inspection, the following blocks from the dictionary are required:\n      * Block 1 (red curved block) - x2\n      * Block 7 (blue cube) - x2\n      * Block 9 (green cube) - x1\n      * Block 10 (red rectangular block) - x1\n      * Block 13 (green rectangular block)- x1\n      * Block 14 (blue rectangular block) - x1\n\n   * **List of Block Indices:** 1, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 1,\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 10\n      Step2: Move block with index 1\n      Step3: Move block with index 14\n      Step4: Move block with index 7\n      Step5: Move block with index 13\n      Step6: Move block with index 7\n      Step7: Move block with index 1\n   }\n   ```\n\n**Important Considerations (and assumptions):**\n\n* **Visual Analysis Limitations:**  Exact determination of the *specific* orientation of the blocks in the Main Target image is challenging solely from these 2D images. Some depth cues are ambiguous, leading to some assumptions.  \n* **Depth and Orientation Ambiguities:** There's no guarantee this exact assembly sequence is *the only* one. It's a plausible representation based on matching appearances."

An orange cylindrical block (13) is placed on top of it.  A red block with a hole (1) is on top of the orange cylinder, centered.  A yellow rectangular block (10) and a red block with a hole (1) are positioned on either side of the orange cylinder and the red block with a hole. Lastly, a triangular block (16) is positioned on top of the central structures.\n\n\nStructure on the right:\n- Block Count: 6\n- Layers: 3\n- Spatial Relationships: A green rectangular block (5) is at the base. An orange cylindrical block (13) sits on top of it. A yellow rectangular block (10) sits on top of the orange cylinder, and then a red triangular block (16) is on top of the yellow block. Finally a green block with a cutout (block index 5) sits on top of the triangular block.\n\nBlock Selection from Dictionary:\n\nStructure on the left:\n1. Block Index 10\n2. Block Index 13\n3. Block Index 1\n4. Block Index 10\n5. Block Index 1\n6. Block Index 16\n\nStructure on the right:\n1. Block Index 5\n2. Block Index 13\n3. Block Index 10\n4. Block Index 16\n5. Block Index 5\n\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 10 (yellow rectangle)\n  Step2: Move block with index 13 (orange cylinder) on top of block 10\n  Step3: Move block with index 1 (red with hole) on top of block 13, centered\n  Step4: Move block with index 10 (yellow rectangle) on the left side of block 1, adjacent to the orange cylinder\n  Step5: Move block with index 1 (red with hole) on the right side of block 1, adjacent to the orange cylinder\n  Step6: Move block with index 16 (red triangle) on top of block 1 (the centered block in middle)\n\n  Step7: Move block with index 5 (green rectangle)\n  Step8: Move block with index 13 (orange cylinder) on top of block 5\n  Step9: Move block with index 10 (yellow rectangle) on top of block 13\n  Step10: Move block with index 16 (red triangle) on top of block 10\n  Step11: Move block with index 5 (green rectangle) on top of block 16\n}\n```"

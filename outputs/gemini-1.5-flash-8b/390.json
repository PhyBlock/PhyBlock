A prominent feature is a central vertical stack of two orange cylindrical blocks topped by a triangular block.  Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally below the orange stack, supporting a red block with an arched opening, on top of which is a small green block, topped by two yellow curved blocks.  An additional, separate structure has a red block with a curved opening and is supported by two stacked green blocks.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:**  Based on the shape, color, and orientation in the target image, the following blocks from the dictionary are needed:\n\n   * **List of Block Indices:**\n     1. Block 10 (orange cylinder)\n     2. Block 10 (orange cylinder)\n     3. Block 14 (red triangular block)\n     4. Block 7 (yellow rectangular block)\n     5.

Block 1 (red block with arch)\n     11. Block 5 (green block)\n     12. Block 1 (red block with arch)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10 on top of block 10\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 14 on top of block 10\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7 next to block 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7 next to block 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1 on top of block 7 and 7\",\n   \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5 on top of block 1\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13 on top of block 5\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 13 on top of block 13\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1 on top of block 10\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 5 next to block 1\",\n\n\n}\n```\n"

There are 10 blocks total, with 4 layers. The blocks are arranged in a vertical stack with an arch-like structure in the mid-section.  The base is composed of a red arch block with two connected identical red blocks beneath. The middle layer has a green arch block connecting two green vertical blocks. The next layer up consists of a yellow rectangular block, and finally the top layer is composed of a red triangle block.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the target image, the required blocks and their indices are:\n\n\n* Block 2 (Red Arch)\n* Block 1 (Red Arch)\n* Block 3 (Red Rectangular)\n* Block 3 (Red Rectangular)\n* Block 5 (Green Vertical)\n* Block 5 (Green Vertical)\n* Block 6 (Green Arch)\n* Block 9 (Yellow Rectangular)\n* Block 13 (Red Triangle)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 3 on top of block index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 2 on top of block index 3.\n   Step4: Move block with index 3 on top of block index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 5 next to block index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 5 on top of block index 3\n   Step7: Move block with index 6 between blocks index 5\n   Step8: Move block with index 9 on top of block index 6\n   Step9: Move block with index 13 on top of block index 9\n}\n"

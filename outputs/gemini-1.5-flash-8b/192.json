A tall, vertical, green block is atop 4 orange cylindrical blocks.  The four cylindrical blocks are positioned in a diamond-like pattern with the green block centered above.  A yellow semi-circular block is on the bottom, and another below the green block.\n\n* **Structure 2 (Tower):** Has 9 blocks across at least 4 layers. The tower is complex and contains blocks in different colors and shapes like rectangles, cylinders, and semi-circles, with differing heights and widths.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure 1 (Giraffe-like):**\n    * Block Index 10 (orange cylinder)  x 4\n    * Block Index 5 (tall green block)\n    * Block Index 13 (yellow semi-circular block)\n\n\n* **Structure 2 (Tower):**\n    * Block Index 6 (yellow rectangle) x 2\n    * Block Index 4 (green rectangular block)\n    * Block Index 3 (blue rectangular block)\n    * Block Index 14 (orange rectangle) x 1\n    * Block Index 15 (red triangle)\n    * Block Index 2 (red curved block)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Structure 1 (Giraffe-like)\": [\n        \"Step 1: Move block with index 10\",\n        \"Step 2: Move block with index 10\",\n        \"Step 3: Move block with index 10\",\n        \"Step 4: Move block with index 10\",\n        \"Step 5: Move block with index 13\",\n        \"Step 6: Move block with index 10\",\n        \"Step 7: Move block with index 5\"\n    ],\n    \"Structure 2 (Tower)\": [\n        \"Step 1: Move block with index 6\",\n        \"Step 2: Move block with index 6\",\n        \"Step 3: Move block with index 4\",\n        \"Step 4: Move block with index 14\",\n        \"Step 5: Move block with index 2\",\n        \"Step 6: Move block with index 3\",\n        \"Step 7: Move block with index 15\",\n        \"Step 8: Move block with index 6\"\n        // And so on, to complete the rest of the tower\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The assembly order for Structure 2 is incomplete, due to not knowing the exact stacking order from the provided image.  The structure has too many blocks to list all the steps. More images of intermediate steps in assembly would be needed for accurate sequence of Structure 2.\n"

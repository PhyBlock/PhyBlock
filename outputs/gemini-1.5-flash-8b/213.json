The spatial arrangement is:\n   * **Layer 1:** A truck-shaped structure, with a curved top, and the bottom consisting of rectangular blocks of different colors are placed in a row.\n   * **Layer 2:** Two large cylindrical blocks have structures built on top of them. The cylindrical blocks support and form a part of the central structure. A partially arched block is placed between them.\n   * **Layer 3:**  Two tall orange cylindrical blocks, topped with pointed blocks, form the top of the structure. Other blocks support each pillar.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n\n   * Block 1 (arch-shaped block)\n   * Block 5 (green rectangular block)\n   * Block 6 (blue square block)\n   * Block 3 (orange square block)\n   * Block 9 (orange cylinder block)\n   * Block 7 (yellow rectangular block)\n   * Block 1 (arch-shaped block) *x2*\n   * Block 13 (red triangular block)*x2*\n   * Block 4 (red square block)*x2*\n   * Block 15 (orange triangle block)*x2*\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 9\nStep2: Move block with index 5\nStep3: Move block with index 6\nStep4: Move block with index 3\nStep5: Move block with index 9\nStep6: Move block with index 1\nStep7: Move block with index 7\nStep8: Move block with index 1\nStep9: Move block with index 13\nStep10: Move block with index 4\nStep11: Move block with index 15\nStep12: Move block with index 13\nStep13: Move block with index 4\nStep14: Move block with index 15\n\n}\n```\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **No Rotation:** The instructions strictly adhere to the orientation of blocks as seen in the dictionary.\n* **Step-by-Step:** Each step clearly indicates the block index to be moved. The order is optimized for a physical assembly, placing the blocks from the bottom-up and layer by layer. Note that due to the nature of the 3D structure, multiple blocks need to be placed simultaneously.\n"

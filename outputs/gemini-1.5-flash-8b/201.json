The exact number of layers isn't immediately obvious from the perspective. There appear to be 3 or more layers within the central structure and a separate 2 layer structure.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:**  The large central structure seems to have a rectangular frame (yellow and green blocks), a vertical post (orange/red cylindrical block), and a triangular roof (red block) atop the post. The separate, smaller structure on the left consists of rectangular blocks (red, brick-like) and a triangular roof (red) on top, built on two levels.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   - **Needed Blocks:** Based on the image, blocks 2 (red rectangular), 4 (green rectangular), 9 (yellow rectangular), 10 (vertical yellow rectangular), 13 (orange cylinder), 14 (orange triangular).  Additionally, blocks 3(red rectangular) and 15 (orange triangular) are required for the smaller structure.\n\n\n   - **List of Block Indices:** 2, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14, 3, 15.\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9 on top of block 10\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4 next to block 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2 next to block 4 (same layer as 9)\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9 to the right of block 4 and next to block 10\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13 to the center, on top of block 10\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14 on top of block 13\",\n\t\"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2 on top of block 9\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 4 on top of block 2\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 3 on top of the top rectangle\",\n\t\"Step11\": \"Move block with index 15 to the left, atop block 2\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 3 on left, on top of rectangle\",\n\t\"Step13\": \"Move block with index 15 to the left of block 2\",\n\t\"Step14\": \"Move block with index 15 to the left of block 3\"\n\n\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:** The assembly order is only approximate.  The exact step-by-step assembly would need additional details to clarify the specific layering. The visual arrangement of the small structure makes clear its bottom and top. The larger structure's layout is not quite as clear from the 2D image. If more steps are needed, more details would need to be shown in the main structure image."

The left structure is a tower with three cylindrical support blocks (orange) and three layers of other blocks built upon them. The right structure is a vehicle-like object with two cylindrical support blocks (orange) and a series of blocks on top.  There are a total of 10 blocks in the structures combined.\n\n   * **Structure 1 (Left):**  The tower has 3 layers of blocks, with varying shapes and colors.  Blocks are placed atop each other and adjacent to each other.  The spatial relationships are key to understanding the correct order.\n   * **Structure 2 (Right):**  The vehicle has 2 base blocks with other blocks on top. It has 2 layers.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Structure 1 (Left):**\n      * Block 6 (yellow rectangular prism): x3\n      * Block 1 (red curved block): x1\n      * Block 10 (yellow curved block): x1\n      * Block 9 (orange cylinder): x3\n      * Block 14 (red rectangular prism): x1\n\n\n   * **Structure 2 (Right):**\n      * Block 9 (orange cylinder): x2\n      * Block 4 (blue cube): x1\n      * Block 10 (yellow curved block): x1\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1 (Left):\" : [\n    \"Step1: Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2: Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step3: Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step4: Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5: Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step6: Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step7: Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step8: Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step9: Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step10: Move block with index 6\"\n  ],\n\n  \"Structure 2 (Right):\" : [\n     \"Step1: Move block with index 9\",\n     \"Step2: Move block with index 10\",\n     \"Step3: Move block with index 4\",\n     \"Step4: Move block with index 9\"\n   ]\n}\n```\n"

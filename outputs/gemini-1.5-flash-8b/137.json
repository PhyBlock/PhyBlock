There are at least 12 distinct blocks, likely more if there are duplicates of shapes. The structure has multiple layers.  The blocks are arranged in a variety of shapes and orientations, creating a somewhat complex arrangement.  The image displays the overall spatial relationships, including which blocks are adjacent, stacked, and/or underneath other blocks.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on careful visual comparison, the following block indices are needed to recreate the structure:\n\n\n| Needed Block | Block Index |\n|---|---|\n| Red Arch | 1 |\n| Red Arch | 2 |\n| Red Arch | 3 |\n| Red Arch | 4 |\n| Blue Square | 5 |\n| Green Square | 6 |\n| Red Square | 7 |\n| Green Square | 8 |\n| Yellow Rectangle | 10|\n| Red Triangle | 15 |\n| Red Triangle | 15 |\n| Orange Triangle | 16 |\n\n**Important Note:**  Block index 15 (Red Triangle) was needed twice.\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1 (Red Arch)\n  Step2: Move block with index 2 (Red Arch)\n  Step3: Move block with index 3 (Red Arch)\n  Step4: Move block with index 4 (Red Arch)\n  Step5: Move block with index 10 (Yellow Rectangle)\n  Step6: Move block with index 5 (Blue Square)\n  Step7: Move block with index 6 (Green Square)\n  Step8: Move block with index 15 (Red Triangle)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 15 (Red Triangle)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 16 (Orange Triangle)\n  Step11: Move block with index 7 (Red Square)\n  Step12: Move block with index 8 (Green Square)\n}\n\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n* The assembly order is a suggested starting point. Some minor adjustments may be necessary to fully match the target image.  \n*  Additional blocks may be present, or some blocks may be duplicated, that are not obvious from just the visible sections in the image. The provided images do not include enough depth to ensure that all parts are explicitly in the same position."

The tower and the small structure have two layers, while the rocket structure has three.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:**  The orange columns are positioned on the left and support a yellow block. The rocket-like structure sits beside the orange columns, with its components stacked atop one another. The blocks are placed in specific positions relative to each other, creating various shapes and structures.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   - **Needed Blocks:** Based on the Target Image, the following block indices are necessary:\n\n     - **Tower:**\n        - Block Index 7 (Orange Cylinder) x 2\n        - Block Index 5 (Yellow Rectangular)\n     - **Rocket Structure:**\n        - Block Index 1 (Red Arch) x 2\n        - Block Index 2 (Red Arch) x 1\n        - Block Index 4 (Yellow Rectangular) x 1\n        - Block Index 9 (Red Rectangular) x 1\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5 on top of block index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5 on top of block index 7(second tower)\",\n   \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1 on the left of block 4\" ,\n   \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4 on top of block 1\" ,\n   \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1 (arch) on top of block 4 (top)\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 9 on top of block 1 (arch) \",\n   \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 2 on the right of block index 9\",\n   \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1 on top of block 9\"\n\n}\n```\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hidden Blocks:** The image only shows parts of the structures, so there could be additional blocks not directly visible.\n* **Multiple Solutions:** The assembly order is a possible solution and not the only way to assemble the structures.  Additional steps may be necessary based on the complete visual information that might be in the actual images or the context of the problem.\n\n\n"

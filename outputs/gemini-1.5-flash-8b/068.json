The structure has 3 layers. The green blocks are rectangular prisms. The orange/red blocks are triangular prisms.  The blocks are arranged with the orange/red blocks supporting and forming the sides and roof of the structure, while the green block forms the vertical central support.  The spatial relationships are crucial: the top-most orange triangle sits atop the central green, the next layer down has two orange triangles flanking the central green, and the bottom layer has two more orange triangles supporting the structure.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** To reproduce the target structure, the following blocks are needed, matching shape, color, and orientation:\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:**\n    * Block 2 (Green)\n    * Block 14 (Orange/Red)\n    * Block 14 (Orange/Red)\n    * Block 14 (Orange/Red)\n    * Block 14 (Orange/Red)\n    * Block 10 (Orange/Red)\n    * Block 10 (Orange/Red)\n    * Block 10 (Orange/Red)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14 to the left of block in step 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2 on top of block from step 1 and 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 14 on top of block from step 3\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10 to the right of block in step 3\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14 on top of block from step 5\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10 on the left of block in step 5\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14 on top of block from step 7\"\n}\n```\n"

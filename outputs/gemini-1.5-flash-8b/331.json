There are two distinct structures.\n\n**Structure 1 (left):**  It appears to be a hollow rectangle composed of 3 blocks (green, yellow, and green).\n\n\n**Structure 2 (right):**  This is a small castle-like structure. It has 3 layers and multiple different shapes and colors. The blocks are arranged in a way that forms a tower-like structure with a small roof on top. The main body is made up of various rectangular and cylindrical blocks (blue, red, green, orange, and yellow).\n\nThere are at least 9 blocks visible in this structure.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the colors, shapes, and orientations visible in the Main Target Image, here are the required blocks and their indices from the Dictionary:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n* Block 1 (red arch) - 1\n* Block 6 (green rectangular) - 2\n* Block 9 (yellow rectangular) - 3\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n* Block 4 (blue rectangular) - 4\n* Block 11 (orange rectangular) - 5\n* Block 10 (orange cylinder) - 6\n* Block 10 (orange cylinder) - 7\n* Block 5 (red rectangular) - 8\n* Block 10 (orange cylinder) - 9\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n   \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n   \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The order for Structure 2 is not a complete step-by-step guide because the precise spatial arrangement of the blocks within each layer is not possible to determine without more information.  The list is presented based on visible blocks and their order of appearance in the image.   A more complete assembly instruction would need a top-down view and layer-by-layer assembly detail for Structure 2.\n"

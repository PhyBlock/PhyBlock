The red blocks form the base, with the green block in the middle layer, and then a red block on top. The red blocks are arranged in a \"V\" shape. The green block is placed in the gap formed by the red blocks in the middle layer.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** 3 red blocks, 2 green blocks\n* **List of Block Indices:**\n    * Red Block (Base): Index 1\n    * Red Block (Base): Index 1\n    * Red Block (Middle): Index 1\n    * Red Block (Top): Index 1\n    * Green Block (Middle): Index 13\n    * Green Block (Middle): Index 13\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1 and place it beside the first block.\n   Step3: Move block with index 1 and place it above the two base blocks, in the center.\n   Step4: Move block with index 13 and place it on top of the middle two red blocks.\n   Step5: Move block with index 13 and place it on top of the middle two red blocks, but higher than the previous green block.\n   Step6: Move block with index 1 and place it on top of the green blocks.\n}\n"

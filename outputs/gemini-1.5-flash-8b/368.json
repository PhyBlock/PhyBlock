            "text": "1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n   The structure uses at least 12 distinct blocks.  It has multiple layers, with blocks stacked vertically and horizontally.  Spatial relationships are complex; blocks are not just placed one on top of the other, but positioned alongside and interlocked in various ways.  There are  curved blocks, rectangular blocks, and triangular blocks used. The colors used are red, blue, green, yellow, and orange/red-orange.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n\n   * Block 1 (red curved block): 1\n   * Block 2 (red curved block): 2\n   * Block 3 (blue cube): 3\n   * Block 4 (blue cube): 4\n   * Block 5 (red square block): 5\n   * Block 6 (green rectangular block): 6\n   * Block 7 (green rectangular block): 7\n   * Block 9 (yellow rectangular block): 9\n   * Block 10 (yellow rectangular block): 10\n   * Block 11 (red/orange triangular block): 11\n   * Block 11 (red/orange triangular block):11\n   * Block 13 (red triangular block):13\n   * Block 14 (yellow rectangular block): 14\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The precise order might vary slightly depending on how one interprets the structure. This solution focuses on a likely first-pass assembly.  It assumes a logical stacking and placement sequence.  Some blocks' exact positioning is less clear from the images and requires careful visual interpretation. Without 3D manipulation, a perfect and complete assembly order is difficult to guarantee.\n"

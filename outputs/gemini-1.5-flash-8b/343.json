There are two distinct sections.\n\n* **Section 1 (Small Structure):**  This section is a small 3-layer structure. It appears to use blocks 6, 13, 14, 8, and possibly a portion of block 7.\n\n* **Section 2 (Tower):** A tall structure made of 4 blocks (two large columns on either side). This is made from block 11 (used twice) and block 2 (used twice). There are two layers of blocks (4-blocks in total) making up the tower. This structure has blocks that are  stacked vertically and horizontally.\n\nThere are a total of 10 blocks, spanning two separate structures.  The precise positioning of some blocks in the smaller structure (specifically parts of blocks 7 and possibly 6) makes the precise block count for the smaller structure less clear from the images alone.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the visible shapes, colors, and orientations in the main image, the necessary blocks from the dictionary are:\n\n* **Block Indices:** 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14.\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 11\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 11\nStep4: Move block with index 2\nStep5: Move block with index 6\nStep6: Move block with index 13\nStep7: Move block with index 14\nStep8: Move block with index 7\nStep9: Move block with index 8\nStep10: Move block with index 9\n\n\n}\n"

There are two distinct structures.  \n\n* **Structure 1 (Rocket):**  This structure is comprised of 10 blocks, arranged in 3-4 layers. The blocks are of various shapes and colors.\n\n* **Structure 2 (Vehicle):**  This structure is comprised of 3 blocks in 2 layers.\n\nSpatial relationships are complex and need to be closely observed for correct order. Blocks are stacked, some are placed side-by-side, and there is a block with a hole in the middle.\n\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n| Structure 1 (Rocket) Blocks | Index |\n|---|---|\n| Red curved block | 1 |\n| Green block | 5 |\n| Blue block | 4 |\n| Yellow block | 6 |\n| Red block (triangular top)| 13 |\n| Red block (triangular top) | 13|\n| Yellow block| 6|\n| Yellow block| 9|\n| Red block| 3|\n\n\n\n| Structure 2 (Vehicle) Blocks | Index |\n|---|---|\n| Yellow block | 9 |\n| Orange Triangular block | 13 |\n| Yellow block | 9 |\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 5\nStep3: Move block with index 4 on top of index 1\nStep4: Move block with index 6 to the right of index 1\nStep5: Move block with index 13 on top of index 5\nStep6: Move block with index 13 to the left of index 5\nStep7: Move block with index 6 on top of index 13 to the right\nStep8: Move block with index 3 to the left of index 13 in the center\nStep9: Move block with index 9 below block index 6, horizontally\nStep10: Move block with index 9 to the bottom layer to create the vehicle\nStep11: Move block with index 9 on the right of the block in layer 2, Vehicle\nStep12: Move block with index 13 on top of index 9, Vehicle\n\n\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  This assembly order is a *possible* interpretation based on the provided images.  A more definitive order might require a more precise 3D model of the structures and blocks to eliminate ambiguity in spatial relationships. There are other possible interpretations depending on how the visual representation of layers is being displayed."

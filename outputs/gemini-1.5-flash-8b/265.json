Focusing on the structure on the left:\n   * **Block Count:** 9 blocks\n   * **Layers:** 4 layers\n   * **Spatial Relationships:**\n     - The bottom layer comprises two identical, horizontally oriented, yellow, curved blocks (Block 11).\n     - Atop these, a single, vertically oriented, yellow rectangular block (Block 9) is positioned.\n     - On top of the yellow block, one horizontally oriented, red block (Block 2) and one orange triangular block (Block 14) with its base pointing down are placed.\n     - Atop the red block, a green block (Block 4) with a curved hole is placed.\n     - On top of the green block, a red block (Block 2) and an orange triangular block (Block 14) with its base pointing down, are placed.\n     - On top of this, the orange triangular block (Block 14) and the final red block are placed to complete the structure on the left.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   * **Needed Blocks:**  Blocks 11, 9, 2, 4, 14, 13 (for the left side structure).\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The steps are ordered based on the image analysis to build the structure layer by layer from bottom to top. The right side structure's blocks aren't explicitly addressed in this analysis as per the instruction."

It has 2 layers.  The light green block sits on top of the yellow cylinder, and the orange cylinder is positioned beside the yellow cylinder.\n\n   **Structure 2 (Right):**  Composed of 6 blocks: 2 red, rectangular, arch-shaped blocks (in the middle), 2 yellow rectangular blocks, and 2 green rectangular blocks. It has 2 layers. The arch-shaped red blocks are in the bottom layer, and the yellow and green blocks are above them. The yellow blocks are positioned to the left and right of the red arch-shaped blocks. The green blocks are also positioned on both sides of the red arch blocks.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   **Structure 1:**\n   * Block 10 (orange cylinder)\n   * Block 5 (light-green rectangular prism)\n   * Block 14 (yellow cylinder)\n\n   **Structure 2:**\n   * Block 1 (red arch-shaped block)\n   * Block 6 (yellow rectangular block)\n   * Block 5 (green rectangular block)\n   * Block 1 (red arch-shaped block)\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1\": [\n    \"Step1: Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step2: Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step3: Move block with index 10\"\n  ],\n  \"Structure 2\": [\n    \"Step1: Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2: Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step3: Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step4: Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5: Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step6: Move block with index 5\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n"

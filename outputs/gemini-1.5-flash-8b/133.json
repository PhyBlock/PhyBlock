One group is to the left of the other. The first layer, in each group, has a pair of red blocks with a concave shape (block index 1 or 2, depending on exact placement) resting horizontally.  On top of these red blocks in each group, there is a taller, vertical block (green and yellow respectively).\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Red blocks with concave shapes, a taller green block, and a taller yellow block.\n* **Block Indices:**\n    * Red Block (concave):  Index 1 (or 2.  If the orientation were consistent across the two, it would be 1, but there is some ambiguity to the viewer in the target image)\n    * Green Block: Index 9\n    * Yellow Block: Index 13\n    * **Important Note:**  Additional blocks may be needed (e.g., the same red block again) so this step needs to be checked and updated as more blocks are needed.\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1 (or 2, depending on visual)\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1( or 2)\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n\n}\n```"

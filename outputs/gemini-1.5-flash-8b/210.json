A precise count is difficult without a complete 3D view.\n   - **Layers:** There are two to three distinct layers in the structure on the right-hand side, and at least 2 in the structure on the left-hand side.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:** The structure on the right comprises two main red blocks with a yellow arch block on top and another red arch-shaped block below them and in line.\n     The structure on the left has a blue cube, a red curved block (arch) on top and underneath that, a red arch-shaped block, then a triangular block in orange and red on top.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n   - **Needed Blocks:** Based on the target image and the block dictionary, the following blocks are required.\n   - **List of Block Indices:**\n      1. 1 (red arch block)\n      2. 2 (red arch block)\n      3. 9 (yellow arch block)\n      4. 6 (blue cube)\n      5. 15 (orange/red triangular block)\n      6. 1 (red arch block) *This is a repetition of 1*\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9 on top of block 1 and 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1 again underneath blocks 1 and 2\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6 on top of arch block structure\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 15 to the left-most structure\"\n\n}\n```\n"

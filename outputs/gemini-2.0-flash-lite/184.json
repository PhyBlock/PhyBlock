Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The target image shows a structure composed of 12 blocks arranged in 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer consists of a red block (index 2), with a blue block (index 5) placed on top of it, and a red curved block (index 1) to the side.\n    *   The second layer consists of two orange blocks (index 9), a green block (index 8) on the left side of the vertical orange block, a yellow block (index 7) next to the green block.\n    *   The third layer consists of a red block (index 2) placed horizontally and a yellow half-cylinder block (index 12) and a yellow half-cylinder block (index 13) on top.\n    *   The fourth layer consists of the red block (index 1) and a blue block (index 5) stacked on the right side.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Block Indices: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13\n*   The indices are selected based on their shape, color, and orientation in the target image.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n    Step11: Move block with index 1\n    Step12: Move block with index 5\n}\n```"

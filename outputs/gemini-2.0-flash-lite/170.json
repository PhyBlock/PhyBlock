A green rectangular block stands vertically on the seat, topped by a yellow, half-cylinder block.\n        *   The structure on the right is a house: One long green block is at the base, with a red arched block on top, and two green rectangular blocks on the sides. There is a blue square block on the middle with orange trapezoid blocks.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   **Structure on the left:**\n        *   Block 8 (2 times)\n        *   Block 10 (4 times)\n        *   Block 7\n        *   Block 11\n    *   **Structure on the right:**\n        *   Block 6 (3 times)\n        *   Block 2\n        *   Block 3\n        *   Block 4\n        *   Block 14 (2 times)\n        *   Block 16\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    ```\n    {\n       Step1: Move block with index 10\n       Step2: Move block with index 10\n       Step3: Move block with index 10\n       Step4: Move block with index 10\n       Step5: Move block with index 8\n       Step6: Move block with index 8\n       Step7: Move block with index 7\n       Step8: Move block with index 11\n       Step9: Move block with index 6\n       Step10: Move block with index 6\n       Step11: Move block with index 6\n       Step12: Move block with index 2\n       Step13: Move block with index 3\n       Step14: Move block with index 4\n       Step15: Move block with index 14\n       Step16: Move block with index 14\n       Step17: Move block with index 16\n    }\n    ```\n"

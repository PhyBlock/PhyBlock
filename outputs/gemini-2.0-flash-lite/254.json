Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n    *   Blocks: 3\n    *   Layers: 3\n    *   Spatial Relationships: The structure consists of three blocks stacked vertically. A red block (with a hole) on top, a green rectangular block in the middle, and another red block (with a hole) at the bottom.\n*   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n    *   Blocks: 9\n    *   Layers: 4\n    *   Spatial Relationships: The structure begins with a base of four blocks: two blue blocks on the outside and one yellow block in the middle, and one blue block on the other side of the yellow block. The next layer consists of a green and a red block, on top of the yellow block. Above those are the red block with the green block on top and finally an orange triangle block on top.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Structure 1:\n    *   Block 2 (Red curved block)\n    *   Block 5 (Green square block)\n    *   Block 2 (Red curved block)\n*   Structure 2:\n    *   Block 4 (Blue cube block)\n    *   Block 8 (Yellow cube block)\n    *   Block 4 (Blue cube block)\n    *   Block 9 (Blue cube block)\n    *   Block 5 (Green square block)\n    *   Block 6 (Orange cube block)\n    *   Block 13 (Red triangle block)\n    *   Block 5 (Green square block)\n    *   Block 6 (Orange cube block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n    Step12: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n"

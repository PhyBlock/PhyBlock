Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The target image shows a structure with two main parts.\n    *   The left structure has 5 blocks and 3 layers.\n    *   The right structure has 9 blocks and 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   The first layer consists of a red, arched block (block 2).\n        *   The second layer consists of a blue cube (block 5) and a green cube (block 6), arranged side by side.\n        *   The third layer consists of a red, arched block (block 3) is on top of the second layer.\n    *   **Right Structure:**\n        *   The base layer consists of four orange cylinders (block 8), standing vertically, arranged in a square formation.\n        *   The second layer consists of two yellow rectangular blocks (block 7), placed horizontally, forming the body.\n        *   The third layer consists of a green cube (block 6) and a blue cube (block 5), placed one above the other to create the neck.\n        *   The fourth layer consists of a yellow arched block (block 11) on top of the neck.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Left Structure:**\n    *   Block 2 (x1)\n    *   Block 5 (x1)\n    *   Block 6 (x1)\n    *   Block 3 (x1)\n*   **Right Structure:**\n    *   Block 8 (x4)\n    *   Block 7 (x2)\n    *   Block 6 (x1)\n    *   Block 5 (x1)\n    *   Block 11 (x1)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 11\n    Step10: Move block with index 2\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n    Step12: Move block with index 6\n    Step13: Move block with index 3\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure comprises two distinct sub-structures (a tower and a house). The tower has 6 blocks across 4 layers, and the house has 4 blocks across 3 layers, for a total of 10 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   **Tower:**\n        *   The base layer consists of a red block with arches.\n        *   The second layer above the base contains two green blocks with arches.\n        *   The third layer consists of one yellow rectangular block.\n        *   The top layer is comprised of an orange triangular block.\n    *   **House:**\n        *   The base is a red square block.\n        *   The second layer consists of a green rectangular block.\n        *   The top layer is an orange triangular block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n\n    *   Block 2 (Red block with arches): x1\n    *   Block 3 (Red block with arch): x2\n    *   Block 8 (Green arch): x2\n    *   Block 12 (Yellow Rectangle): x1\n    *   Block 15 (Orange triangle): x2\n    *   Block 5 (Orange cube): x1\n    *   Block 10 (Green Rectangle): x1\n    *   Block 6 (Red cube): x1\n    *   Block 11 (Yellow Rectangle): x1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 6\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 15\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n    Step12: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 17 blocks across 3 distinct groups.\n    *   Group 1 (Left): Comprises 8 blocks, forming a bridge-like structure.\n        *   Layer 1: 2 blocks; 1 cylinder (orange) and 1 triangle (orange).\n        *   Layer 2: 2 blocks; 1 cylinder (orange) and 1 cube (green).\n        *   Layer 3: 1 block (arch, red).\n        *   Layer 4: 2 blocks; 1 triangle (orange) and 1 cube (green)\n    *   Group 2 (Center): Comprises 3 blocks.\n        *   Layer 1: 2 blocks; 2 cylinders (orange).\n        *   Layer 2: 1 block (cube, green).\n    *   Group 3 (Right): Comprises 6 blocks, forming a cuboid with a circular hole.\n        *   Layer 1: 2 blocks, 1 red block with a circular hole and 1 green block.\n        *   Layer 2: 2 blocks, 1 blue cube and 1 green block.\n        *   Layer 3: 2 blocks, 1 red block with a circular hole and 1 green block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Group 1 (bridge-like structure): The two cylinders, the triangle and the cube act as supports for the arch block.  The second triangle and the cube are on the right side of the structure.\n    *   Group 2: Two cylinders supports a central green cube.\n    *   Group 3 (cuboid structure): The structure is assembled in layers. The circular blocks are on the top and bottom, and the blue and green cubes form the central layer.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Block Indices:\n    *   1: 2 blocks (arch block - red)\n    *   3: 2 blocks (circular block - red)\n    *   4: 1 block (cube - blue)\n    *   5: 3 blocks (cube - green)\n    *   8: 2 blocks (cylinder - green)\n    *   10: 4 blocks (cylinder - orange)\n    *   14: 2 blocks (triangle - orange)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n    Step12: Move block with index 3\n    Step13: Move block with index 3\n    Step14: Move block with index 5\n    Step15: Move block with index 4\n    Step16: Move block with index 5\n}\n```\n"

The structure on the left has 5 blocks, and the structure on the right has 10 blocks.\n    *   The left structure has 2 layers.\n    *   The right structure has 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Left structure: The orange triangle base supports the green block, which in turn supports the orange triangle block. There is a blue block on each side of the orange triangle base.\n    *   Right structure: The structure is composed of a base of two yellow blocks, on top of which is a blue block. Above the blue block sits a green block. Above the green block is a red block with a curve cut out of its front. A yellow block sits above the red block and supports the orange triangular blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Left Structure:**\n    *   Block 16 (Orange Triangle base)\n    *   Block 16 (Orange Triangle base)\n    *   Block 4 (Green block)\n    *   Block 3 (Blue block)\n    *   Block 3 (Blue block)\n\n*   **Right Structure:**\n    *   Block 6 (Yellow)\n    *   Block 6 (Yellow)\n    *   Block 3 (Blue)\n    *   Block 4 (Green)\n    *   Block 1 (Red)\n    *   Block 7 (Yellow)\n    *   Block 13 (Orange Triangle)\n    *   Block 13 (Orange Triangle)\n\n**3.

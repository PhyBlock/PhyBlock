Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The target image shows two separate structures.\n\n    *   Structure 1:  Uses 9 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    *   Structure 2: Uses 5 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:**\n        *   Layer 1 (bottom): Contains two green rectangular blocks (vertical). There are two yellow rectangular blocks, one on the left, the other on the right of the green blocks, covering the green blocks.\n        *   Layer 2 (middle):  Contains two orange cylindrical blocks, one on the left, and one on the right. There is a yellow rectangular block that covers the orange cylindrical blocks at the top.\n        *   Layer 3 (top): Contains an orange triangular block that is centered on the top layer.\n    *   **Structure 2:**\n        *   Layer 1 (bottom): Contains a red block with a semi-circular cut-out on both the top and the bottom.\n        *   Layer 2 (middle): Contains a yellow block with a semi-circular cut-out on the top.\n        *   Layer 3 (top): Contains a red block with a semi-circular cut-out on both the top and the bottom.\n\n**2.

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure appears to have 20 blocks and 3 layers in some areas and 2 layers in others.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer is primarily composed of arch-shaped blocks (index 1 & 2).\n    *   On the left side, a red arch (index 1) forms the base, supporting a yellow rectangular block (index 10), and then a green block (index 4), and an orange angled block (index 16). There's also a green block (index 9) supporting a blue block (index 3) and an orange block (index 5).\n    *   In the middle section, two yellow half-cylinder blocks (index 13) are used.\n    *   On the right side, there's a red arch (index 2) as the base. Above it is a vertical green block (index 9), a yellow vertical block (index 11), and an orange rectangular block (index 15). There's a blue cube (index 3) and another vertical green block (index 9).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:** 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 11, 13, 13, 15, 16.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 5\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 3\n    Step12: Move block with index 13\n    Step13: Move block with index 13\n    Step14: Move block with index 9\n    Step15: Move block with index 11\n    Step16: Move block with index 15\n    Step17: Move block with index 3\n    Step18: Move block with index 4\n    Step19: Move block with index 5\n    Step20: Move block with index 3\n}\n```"

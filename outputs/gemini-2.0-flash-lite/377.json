Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The target image contains two distinct structures.\n    *   Structure 1 (left):  This structure uses 7 blocks and has 4 layers.\n    *   Structure 2 (right): This structure uses 8 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Structure 1:\n        *   The base layer consists of a yellow block.\n        *   Above the yellow block is a red block, and a second yellow block.\n        *   A green block sits on top of the red block.\n        *   Two blue blocks sit on top of the green block.\n    *   Structure 2:\n        *   The base consists of a yellow semicircular block and two orange trapezoidal blocks.\n        *   Above the yellow semicircular block is a red block with a semi-circular hole.\n        *   On top of this red block are 3 more yellow semicircular blocks.\n        *   On top of the 3 semicircular blocks there is a red block on top of the other yellow semicircular blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 7 (Yellow block)\n    *   Block 1 (Red block)\n    *   Block 10 (Yellow block)\n    *   Block 6 (Green block)\n    *   Block 4 (Blue block) x 2\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 9 (Yellow semicircular block)\n    *   Block 16 (Orange block) x2\n    *   Block 2 (Red block with hole)\n    *   Block 9 (Yellow semicircular block) x3\n    *   Block 14 (Orange triangular block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 4\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 16\n   Step9: Move block with index 16\n   Step10: Move block with index 2\n   Step11: Move block with index 9\n   Step12: Move block with index 9\n   Step13: Move block with index 9\n   Step14: Move block with index 14\n}\n"

Structure 2 (right) has 6 blocks and 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:**\n        *   The base is formed by a red block with an arch shape.\n        *   Above the red arch, a yellow semi-circular block sits horizontally.\n        *   On top of the yellow block sits a blue block.\n        *   On top of the blue block sits a red block with a triangular roof shape.\n    *   **Structure 2:**\n        *   The base is formed by an orange block.\n        *   Above the orange block sits a red block with a semi-circular hole.\n        *   A green rectangular block sits on top of the red block.\n        *   A red block with a triangular roof shape sits on top of the green block.\n        *   To the right side of the orange block sits a blue square block.\n        *   On top of the blue square block sits an orange cube block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block with index 2 (red arch)\n    *   Block with index 8 (yellow semi-circle)\n    *   Block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    *   Block with index 13 (red triangle roof)\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block with index 16 (orange cube)\n    *   Block with index 1 (red semi-circle)\n    *   Block with index 6 (green rectangle)\n    *   Block with index 13 (red triangle roof)\n    *   Block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    *   Block with index 12 (orange cube)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 16\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n"

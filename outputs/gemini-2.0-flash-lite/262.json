There are 2 structures. The first structure has 4 blocks across 3 layers. The second structure has 11 blocks across 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The first structure, on the left, appears to be a house. It consists of two blocks forming a roof shape (orange), and two blocks forming the house base (green).\n    *   The second structure, on the right, resembles a chair. It consists of four vertical blocks (green) forming the legs, a horizontal block (yellow) on top of two legs forming the seat, a stack of three blocks (red, blue, yellow) forming the back, and finally a semi-circular block (yellow) on top of the back.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1**\n    *   Roof Blocks: 13, 14\n    *   Base Blocks: 2, 11\n*   **Structure 2**\n    *   Leg Blocks: 4, 4\n    *   Seat Block: 5\n    *   Back Blocks: 3, 1, 7\n    *   Back topper: 6\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 5\n    Step8: Move block with index 3\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 7\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n}\n```"

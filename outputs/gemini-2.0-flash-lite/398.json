The first structure (left) has 2 layers with 6 blocks. The second structure (right) has 4 layers with 9 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1 (Left):** The first structure is composed of two rectangular blocks. Two rectangular blocks are positioned vertically, and another is horizontally.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Right):** The second structure has a cylindrical block at the base, then a rectangular block on top of it, and followed by a hollow rectangle which is made up of four rectangular blocks and a triangular block in the middle. The top layer consists of a small blue block on a rectangular block.\n\n**2.

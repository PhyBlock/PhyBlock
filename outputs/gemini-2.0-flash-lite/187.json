The structure has two layers: 1 top layer block, 3 middle layer blocks, and 6 bottom layer blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   Structure 1 (Left Side): Has a top orange triangle block, two yellow horizontal blocks, two green vertical blocks and two yellow vertical blocks. The orange triangle block is on top of the two yellow horizontal blocks. The two green vertical blocks are between the two yellow vertical blocks. The four vertical blocks support the two horizontal blocks.\n    *   Structure 2 (Right Side): Has a green horizontal block on top of two orange cylinders. The two orange cylinders support the green horizontal block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Block 1 (Green horizontal block) - for the top of structure 2\n    *   Block 5 (Yellow horizontal block) - for the top of structure 1.\n    *   Block 5 (Yellow horizontal block) - for the bottom of structure 1.\n    *   Block 2 (Green vertical block) - for the middle of structure 1.\n    *   Block 2 (Green vertical block) - for the middle of structure 1.\n    *   Block 6 (Yellow vertical block) - for the side of structure 1.\n    *   Block 6 (Yellow vertical block) - for the side of structure 1.\n    *   Block 10 (Orange cylinder block) - for the bottom of structure 2.\n    *   Block 10 (Orange cylinder block) - for the bottom of structure 2.\n    *   Block 14 (Orange triangle block) - for the top of structure 1\n\n*   **List Block Indices:** 1, 5, 5, 2, 2, 6, 6, 10, 10, 14\n\n**3.

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target image displays two structures.\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Left):**  This structure has three layers.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of a red block with a cylindrical cutout, with yellow rectangular blocks on top.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Composed of two orange cylindrical blocks and a yellow rectangular block on top of them.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Is composed of an orange triangular block and yellow rectangular blocks on both side\n*   **Structure 2 (Right):** This structure also has three layers.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Composed of a green rectangular block.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of a green cylindrical block, with a yellow rectangular block on top of it.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** The top layer consists of a green rectangular block, with a yellow rectangular block on top of the sides, and an orange triangular block on top of the middle of green block\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   Block 1: Red U-shaped block (Layer 1, Structure 1)\n    *   Block 4: Green rectangular block (Layer 1, Structure 2)\n    *   Block 7: Green rectangular block (Layer 2, Structure 2)\n    *   Block 11: Orange cylindrical block (Layer 2, Structure 1 & Structure 2)\n    *   Block 14: Orange triangular block (Layer 3, Structure 1 & Structure 2)\n    *   Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (Layer 1,2,3 in both structures)\n    *   Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (Layer 1, Structure 1)\n    *   Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (Layer 3, Structure 1)\n    *   Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (Layer 2, Structure 2)\n    *   Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (Layer 3, Structure 2)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 4\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 14\n    Step12: Move block with index 7\n    Step13: Move block with index 10\n    Step14: Move block with index 10\n    Step15: Move block with index 10\n    Step16: Move block with index 10\n    Step17: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n"

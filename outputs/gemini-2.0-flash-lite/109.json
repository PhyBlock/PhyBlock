The yellow block is on the left side, the green block is in the middle, and the blue block is on the right side. All three blocks are oriented upright.\n        *   Layer 2: It sits on the layer below and consists of a yellow block (block 9) which is laying flat on its long side and is resting on top of the first layer.\n        *   Layer 3: Sits on top of the layer below and consists of a red block (block 2).\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   Block 10: Yellow horizontal block (layer 1, left)\n    *   Block 7: Green square block (layer 1, middle)\n    *   Block 6: Blue square block (layer 1, right)\n    *   Block 9: Yellow horizontal block (layer 2)\n    *   Block 2: Red U-shaped block (layer 3)\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    ```\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 10\n        Step2: Move block with index 7\n        Step3: Move block with index 6\n        Step4: Move block with index 9\n        Step5: Move block with index 2\n    }\n    ```\n"

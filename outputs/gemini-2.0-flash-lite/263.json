The first structure (left) uses 5 blocks in 2 layers. The second structure (right) uses 8 blocks in 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Structure 1):**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of a red arched block.\n    *   The top layer consists of an orange triangular block, placed on top of two orange triangular blocks that form the roof.\n    *   One orange triangular block is placed on top of the center of the red arched block and is attached to the other two orange triangular blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Structure 2):**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of a yellow rectangular block.\n    *   On top of the yellow block, a green rectangular block is placed.\n    *   Above the green block a red square block is placed. Then, above the red block, a green rectangular block is placed. Lastly, above the green block, a blue cube block is placed.\n    *   The top layer consists of another yellow rectangular block, placed horizontally above the blocks below.\n    *   These two yellow rectangular blocks are parallel and attached to the green blocks between.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Red arched block: Index 1\n    *   Orange triangular block: Index 14\n    *   Orange triangular block: Index 14\n    *   Orange triangular block: Index 16\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Yellow rectangular block (bottom): Index 9\n    *   Green rectangular block: Index 8\n    *   Red square block: Index 5\n    *   Green rectangular block: Index 8\n    *   Blue cube block: Index 4\n    *   Yellow rectangular block (top): Index 9\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 16\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 5\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n"

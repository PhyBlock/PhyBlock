Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure has 22 blocks and 4 layers.\n    *   Train Cart:\n        *   Layer 1: 2 blocks\n        *   Layer 2: 5 blocks\n        *   Layer 3: 3 blocks\n        *   Layer 4: 2 blocks\n    *   Train Engine:\n        *   Layer 1: 4 blocks\n        *   Layer 2: 3 blocks\n        *   Layer 3: 1 block\n        *   Layer 4: 2 blocks\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The structure is composed of a train cart and a train engine.\n    *   Train Cart:\n        *   Two orange cylindrical blocks form the wheels at the bottom layer.\n        *   The second layer has 5 blocks, with the orange cylinder blocks attached to the front and back end and a red rectangular block in between.\n        *   The third layer has 3 blocks. A green block is attached to the red block, a blue block on top of it and then a yellow rounded rectangular block on top of the blue block.\n        *   The top layer has a yellow rounded rectangular block on top of the green and the blue block.\n    *   Train Engine:\n        *   The first layer has 4 blocks. 2 blocks indexed 2, and one on top of each other.\n        *   The second layer has 3 blocks.\n        *   The third layer has a yellow rectangular block on top of the second layer blocks.\n        *   The top layer has 2 yellow rectangular blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   13, 13 (Train Cart Wheels)\n    *   14, 14 (Train Cart Wheels)\n    *   2, 2, 2, 2 (Engine Base Arch)\n    *   5 (Blue Block)\n    *   6 (Green Block)\n    *   8 (Green Block)\n    *   7 (Red Block)\n    *   16 (Yellow Rounded Block)\n    *   16 (Yellow Rounded Block)\n    *   10, 10, 10 (Yellow Rectangular)\n    *   11, 11 (Yellow Rectangular)\n    *   12, 12 (Yellow Rectangular)\n    *   3, 3 (Engine Arch)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n    Step10: Move block with index 16\n    Step11: Move block with index 10\n    Step12: Move block with index 10\n    Step13: Move block with index 10\n    Step14: Move block with index 2\n    Step15: Move block with index 2\n    Step16: Move block with index 2\n    Step17: Move block with index 2\n    Step18: Move block with index 11\n    Step19: Move block with index 11\n    Step20: Move block with index 12\n    Step21: Move block with index 12\n    Step22: Move block with index 3\n    Step23: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n"

The shape of each of these base blocks is like a ramp.\n    *   Layer 1 (Middle): One block is placed on the top of the block at the bottom-left, and another block is placed on top of the block at the bottom-right. The shape of each of these blocks is like an arch. The space created in the middle is shaped like a rectangle, and the distance between the arch blocks is smaller than the width of the base blocks.\n    *   Layer 2 (Top): One rectangular block is placed between the two arch blocks.\n    *   Layer 3 (Top): One triangular block is placed on top of the rectangular block.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   Block 14 (base, ramp-shaped block) - x2\n    *   Block 2 (arch block) - x2\n    *   Block 6 (rectangular block) - x1\n    *   Block 16 (triangular block) - x1\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

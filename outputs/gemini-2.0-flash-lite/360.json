Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** There are 18 blocks in total, with each structure having 9 blocks. The structure has 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of 4 blue blocks.\n    *   The second layer is a yellow block on top of the blue blocks.\n    *   The third layer consists of a blue block on top of the yellow block, a red block on the right, and a green block on top of the red block.\n    *   The top layer is an orange roof block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:** The following blocks are required, based on their color and orientation:\n    *   Block 5 (blue block)\n    *   Block 3 (red block)\n    *   Block 8 (green block)\n    *   Block 9 (yellow block)\n    *   Block 13 (orange roof block)\n    *   Block 1 (blue block)\n*   Therefore the following indices are needed in the assembly: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 13.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 1\n    Step12: Move block with index 1\n    Step13: Move block with index 1\n    Step14: Move block with index 9\n    Step15: Move block with index 5\n    Step16: Move block with index 3\n    Step17: Move block with index 8\n    Step18: Move block with index 13\n}\n```"

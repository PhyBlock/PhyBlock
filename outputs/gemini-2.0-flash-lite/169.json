A red rectangular block is also on top of the green block.\n        *   Section 2: A red arched bridge supports multiple blocks. A blue cube, a yellow block (vertical), an orange house-shaped block, and a green block (vertical) are directly on the bridge. On top of these, the building has a yellow arched block with a red roof-shaped block on top, and another red roof-shaped block.\n        *   The green block is between the yellow block and the orange block.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n    *   Block Index 1: (4 occurrences) - Red arched block, horizontal orientation.\n    *   Block Index 2: (1 occurrence) - Blue cube.\n    *   Block Index 3: (2 occurrences) - Green cuboid block.\n    *   Block Index 4: (2 occurrences) - Orange cube.\n    *   Block Index 6: (1 occurrence) - Green cuboid, horizontal orientation.\n    *   Block Index 7: (1 occurrence) - Green block, vertical orientation.\n    *   Block Index 8: (1 occurrence) - Yellow block, horizontal orientation.\n    *   Block Index 9: (1 occurrence) - Yellow block, vertical orientation.\n    *   Block Index 11: (1 occurrence) - Yellow arch.\n    *   Block Index 14: (1 occurrence) - Red roof, angled right.\n    *   Block Index 16: (1 occurrence) - Red roof, angled left.\n    *   Block Index 6: (1 occurrence) - Green block, horizontal.\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n    ```\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 1\n        Step2: Move block with index 1\n        Step3: Move block with index 1\n        Step4: Move block with index 1\n        Step5: Move block with index 6\n        Step6: Move block with index 6\n        Step7: Move block with index 3\n        Step8: Move block with index 2\n        Step9: Move block with index 7\n        Step10: Move block with index 8\n        Step11: Move block with index 4\n        Step12: Move block with index 9\n        Step13: Move block with index 11\n        Step14: Move block with index 16\n        Step15: Move block with index 14\n        Step16: Move block with index 3\n    }\n    ```\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 10 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Layer 1 (Base): The base layer includes a green block (index 8) and a yellow block (index 7) stacked side by side. The red triangular block (index 16) is adjacent to the green block.\n    *   Layer 2: A blue block (index 6) is stacked on the yellow block. Another green block (index 8) is placed on top of the first green block. The orange cylinder (index 13) is placed adjacent to the second green block.\n    *   Layer 3: The red block (index 2) is placed on top of the orange cylinder (index 13).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:** 8, 7, 16, 6, 8, 13, 2\n*   **Explanation:** The selection of blocks is based on their shape and orientation in the target image. For example, index 8 is selected twice, as there are two horizontal green blocks, and the red arch block (index 2) is selected, as it is a matching shape and orientation. The red triangular block (index 16) is also needed.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 16\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n}\n```"

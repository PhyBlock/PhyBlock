Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The target structure consists of 15 blocks across a total of 5 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:**\n        *   Layer 1: Three orange cylindrical blocks (11) are aligned vertically.\n        *   Layer 2: Two yellow rectangular blocks (8) are placed horizontally, connected to the top of the cylindrical blocks.\n        *   Layer 3: One blue square block (5) is placed on top of the yellow blocks. One red block (2) is over the yellow blocks.\n        *   Layer 4: One red arch block (2) is placed on top of the yellow blocks.\n        *   Layer 5: One orange rectangular block (13) is placed on top.\n    *   **Structure 2:**\n        *   Layer 1: Two red arch blocks (2) at both ends of the structure, with yellow rectangular block (10) between them.\n        *   Layer 2: Two red arch blocks (2) on top of red arch blocks.\n        *   Layer 3: Yellow rectangular block (10) between them.\n\n**2.

A green block is placed on top of the blue cube.\n            *   Layer 3 (Top): A red rectangular block is placed on top of the green block, and a red triangle block is placed on top of the red block.\n        *   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n            *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Two arch-like blocks are placed side by side.\n            *   Layer 2 (Middle): A red block with a circular hole is placed on top of the two arch blocks.\n            *   Layer 3 (Top): A yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the red blocks with a circular hole.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   **Block Indices:**\n        *   Block 2: Two units (for the base of the left structure).\n        *   Block 6: One unit (for the center of the left structure).\n        *   Block 7: One unit (for the center of the left structure).\n        *   Block 4: One unit (for the top of the left structure).\n        *   Block 15: One unit (for the top of the left structure).\n        *   Block 2: Two units (for the base of the right structure).\n        *   Block 11: Two units (for the top of the right structure).\n        *   Block 4: Two units (for the center of the right structure).\n    *   **Matching Criteria:** The selected blocks must match the shape and rotational orientation exactly as they appear in the target image.\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    ```\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 2\n        Step2: Move block with index 2\n        Step3: Move block with index 6\n        Step4: Move block with index 7\n        Step5: Move block with index 4\n        Step6: Move block with index 15\n        Step7: Move block with index 2\n        Step8: Move block with index 2\n        Step9: Move block with index 4\n        Step10: Move block with index 4\n        Step11: Move block with index 11\n        Step12: Move block with index 11\n    }\n    ```\n"

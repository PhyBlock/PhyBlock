The structure can be viewed as having 4 main layers.\n    *   Layer 1: Base structure with 2 blocks of index 1, block with index 4, block with index 3, and block with index 1.\n    *   Layer 2: Two blocks of index 12, block with index 8 and blocks of index 6.\n    *   Layer 3: Block with index 5, block with index 8 and block with index 4\n    *   Layer 4: Block with index 11 and 2 blocks of index 16.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The first layer consists of a horizontal base of connected blocks of index 1 on each side. Index 3 in the middle, index 4 on the left side.\n    *   The second layer consists of index 12, laid on top of the blocks of index 1 from the first layer and index 8 on top of the middle section and blocks of index 6.\n    *   The third layer consists of index 5, index 8 and index 4, resting on top of the second layer.\n    *   The fourth layer consists of index 11, supporting a rectangular base with blocks of index 16, and a base with blocks of index 16.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Identify Needed Blocks:** Blocks with indices 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 16 are required.\n*   **List Block Indices:** [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 11, 12, 12, 16, 16, 16]\n\n**3.

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:**\n    *   The target structure uses 13 blocks and has three layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The structure is split into two separate parts.\n    *   **Part 1:** Consists of a base with 2 red arch blocks, a green rectangular block, a blue square block, and an orange triangular block on the base. Two cylinders on either side.\n    *   **Part 2:** Consists of a base made of two arch blocks that are resting on another arch block, along with a yellow block as a second layer and two rectangular red blocks.\n    *   Blocks are arranged adjacent, above, or below one another.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis of the target image, the following blocks from the dictionary are required:\n    *   Arch block (red)\n    *   Arch block (red)\n    *   Arch block (red)\n    *   Rectangular Block (green)\n    *   Cube (blue)\n    *   Cylinder (orange)\n    *   Rectangular Block (yellow)\n    *   Cube (orange)\n    *   Rectangular Block (red)\n\n*   **List Block Indices:**\n    *   Block 1\n    *   Block 2\n    *   Block 6\n    *   Block 3\n    *   Block 10\n    *   Block 10\n    *   Block 7\n    *   Block 8\n    *   Block 13\n\n**3.

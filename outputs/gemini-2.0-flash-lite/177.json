The first structure has 13 blocks and 4 layers. The second structure has 7 blocks and 3 layers.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships (First Structure):**\n        *   Layer 1 (Base): Two blocks index 2 are used at the bottom.\n        *   Layer 2: Two blocks index 6 are stacked on top of the block index 2 to the right side. A yellow block index 8 is placed horizontally on top of the two index 6 blocks.\n        *   Layer 3: A block index 4 is placed in the middle.\n        *   Layer 4: A block index 13 is placed at the top.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships (Second Structure):**\n        *   Layer 1 (Base): A yellow block index 11.\n        *   Layer 2: A green block index 9 is placed vertically on top of the left side, a blue block index 5 is placed in the middle, and a red block index 7 is placed in the middle.\n        *   Layer 3: Another yellow block index 11 is placed on top of the previous layer.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   Blocks Needed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\n    *   Block Indices:\n        *   First Structure: 2, 2, 6, 6, 8, 4, 13\n        *   Second Structure: 11, 9, 5, 7, 11\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    ```\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 2\n        Step2: Move block with index 2\n        Step3: Move block with index 6\n        Step4: Move block with index 6\n        Step5: Move block with index 8\n        Step6: Move block with index 4\n        Step7: Move block with index 13\n        Step8: Move block with index 11\n        Step9: Move block with index 9\n        Step10: Move block with index 5\n        Step11: Move block with index 7\n        Step12: Move block with index 11\n    }\n    ```"

This consists of rectangular blocks on top of cylindrical blocks, forming wheels.\n        *   To the right is a structure with several cylindrical blocks forming the base. On top of the base is a rectangular block. A red arched block sits on top, supporting an orange triangular prism block.\n        *   There is also a tower consisting of orange cylindrical blocks. On the top is an orange triangular prism block.\n        *   Blocks are arranged in layers, some stacked directly on top of each other, others with blocks bridging or connecting elements.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n        *   Block 1: Arched block (Red)\n        *   Block 2: Cube (Blue)\n        *   Block 3: Cube (Orange)\n        *   Block 4: Cube (Red)\n        *   Block 5: Rectangle (Green)\n        *   Block 6: Rectangle (Green)\n        *   Block 7: Rectangle (Yellow)\n        *   Block 8: Cylinder (Orange)\n        *   Block 9: Cylinder (Orange)\n        *   Block 10: Arch (Yellow)\n        *   Block 11: Rectangle (Yellow)\n        *   Block 13: Triangular Prism (Orange)\n        *   Block 14: Triangular Prism (Orange)\n        *   Block 16: Triangular Prism (Orange)\n    *   **List Block Indices:**\n        *   1 (x1)\n        *   2 (x1)\n        *   3 (x1)\n        *   4 (x1)\n        *   5 (x1)\n        *   6 (x1)\n        *   7 (x2)\n        *   8 (x6)\n        *   9 (x2)\n        *   10 (x1)\n        *   13 (x1)\n        *   14 (x1)\n        *   16 (x1)\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    ```\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 9\n        Step2: Move block with index 9\n        Step3: Move block with index 5\n        Step4: Move block with index 6\n        Step5: Move block with index 2\n        Step6: Move block with index 7\n        Step7: Move block with index 7\n        Step8: Move block with index 3\n        Step9: Move block with index 4\n        Step10: Move block with index 8\n        Step11: Move block with index 8\n        Step12: Move block with index 8\n        Step13: Move block with index 8\n        Step14: Move block with index 11\n        Step15: Move block with index 10\n        Step16: Move block with index 1\n        Step17: Move block with index 14\n        Step18: Move block with index 8\n        Step19: Move block with index 8\n        Step20: Move block with index 16\n        Step21: Move block with index 13\n    }\n    ```\n"

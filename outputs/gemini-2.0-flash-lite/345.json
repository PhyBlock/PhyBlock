Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 18 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Composed of three red arch blocks (index 1) on the left, then two red arch blocks (index 2) in the center, and then another red arch block (index 1) on the right. The blocks are adjacent to each other, forming a foundation.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** On top of the arch blocks, in this layer, are (left to right): a green cube (index 4) on top of the first red arch (index 1), a red cube (index 6) on the first arch on the left of the structure (index 1), a blue cube (index 3) and a yellow cube (index 7) on the middle red arches (index 2), another green cube (index 4) on top of the right most red arch (index 1). Then there are three vertical yellow blocks (index 11) on top of the base. Finally, on top of the right most arch (index 1), a green vertical block (index 8).\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Two orange roof blocks (index 16) are put on top of the green and red cubes (index 4, 6) on the left. Another orange roof block (index 16) is on top of the yellow cube (index 7) in the center and there is a yellow semi-circular block (index 12) on top of the central red arch (index 2). And finally another orange roof block (index 15) is on the right of the structure on top of the right green vertical block (index 8).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Identified Blocks:** The following blocks are required:\n    *   Block Index 1 (Red Arch): x3\n    *   Block Index 2 (Red Arch): x2\n    *   Block Index 3 (Blue Cube): x1\n    *   Block Index 4 (Green Cube): x2\n    *   Block Index 6 (Red Cube): x1\n    *   Block Index 7 (Yellow Cube): x1\n    *   Block Index 8 (Green Vertical Block): x1\n    *   Block Index 11 (Yellow Vertical Block): x3\n    *   Block Index 12 (Yellow Semi-Circular Block): x1\n    *   Block Index 15 (Orange Roof): x1\n    *   Block Index 16 (Orange Roof): x2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 4\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 3\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 4\n   Step11: Move block with index 8\n   Step12: Move block with index 11\n   Step13: Move block with index 11\n   Step14: Move block with index 11\n   Step15: Move block with index 16\n   Step16: Move block with index 16\n   Step17: Move block with index 12\n   Step18: Move block with index 15\n}\n"

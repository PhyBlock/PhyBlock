The structure on the left consists of three layers (excluding the head). The right structure has three layers in the lowest section and multiple layers on top of the bottom section.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The structure on the left has a base made of a blue and yellow block on top of each other. The next layer is made of an orange, yellow, and orange block. Above that is a cylinder, a red and yellow block at the top (like a head).\n    *   The structure on the right has a base consisting of four red arch blocks (indices 1 and 2) supporting a lower layer.\n    *   On top of the arches is a layer comprised of a series of blocks: a blue, yellow, green, and yellow block.\n    *   On top of those blocks sit a yellow, orange, and green block.\n\n**2.

One resembles a chair, and the other is an abstract shape.\n*   **Blocks & Layers (Chair):**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Legs):** 4 orange cylindrical blocks\n    *   **Layer 2 (Seat):** 2 yellow rectangular blocks\n    *   **Layer 3 (Back):** 1 green block, 1 blue block, and 1 yellow half-cylinder block.\n*   **Blocks & Layers (Abstract Shape):**\n    *   **Layer 1:** 2 orange triangular blocks and 1 blue rectangular block between the triangles.\n    *   **Layer 2:** 1 green rectangular block over the blue block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Chair:** The orange cylindrical blocks form the legs and are arranged in a rectangular shape. The yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of the legs forming the seat. The green rectangular block is placed on top of the seat. The blue rectangular block is placed on top of the green block. The yellow half-cylinder block is placed on top of the blue block to complete the back of the chair.\n    *   **Abstract Shape:** The orange triangular blocks are adjacent and angled. The blue rectangular block is between the two orange triangles, and the green rectangular block sits on top of the blue block and between the triangular orange blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Chair:**\n    *   Block 8: (Orange cylinder - legs x4) x4\n    *   Block 7: (Yellow rectangular - seat x2) x2\n    *   Block 2: (Green rectangular - back x1) x1\n    *   Block 1: (Blue rectangular - back x1) x1\n    *   Block 10: (Yellow half-cylinder- back x1) x1\n*   **Abstract Shape:**\n    *   Block 14: (Orange triangle - base x2) x2\n    *   Block 1: (Blue rectangular - base x1) x1\n    *   Block 4: (Green rectangular - top x1) x1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n    Step11: Move block with index 14\n    Step12: Move block with index 1\n    Step13: Move block with index 4\n}\n"

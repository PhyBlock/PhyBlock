Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** There are 18 blocks total and the structure has 3 layers (though the left structure is slightly more complex in its layering).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The structure consists of two connected parts.\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   A red curved block at the base.\n        *   Above this, there is a yellow and an orange block.\n        *   The yellow block is on the lower left.\n        *   Above these, there is another orange block.\n        *   A central opening is formed by a red circular block.\n        *   Above the opening is a blue square and on the top is a green block.\n        *   Above the green block are two orange triangular blocks forming a roof.\n    *   **Right Structure:**\n        *   A red curved block at the base.\n        *   Above this is a red block and two green blocks on the sides.\n        *   A yellow block forms the roof.\n        *   There is a second, slightly larger, green block on top of the blocks and in the center.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n    *   Block 2 (Red curved base)\n    *   Block 7 (Yellow)\n    *   Block 6 (Red)\n    *   Block 13 (Orange)\n    *   Block 4 (Blue Square)\n    *   Block 5 (Green Cube)\n    *   Block 16 (Orange)\n    *   Block 14 (Orange)\n    *   Block 1 (Red curved base)\n    *   Block 3 (Red)\n    *   Block 10 (Green long)\n    *   Block 12 (Yellow long)\n    *   Block 10 (Green long)\n    *   Block 10 (Green long)\n    *   Block 8 (Green long)\n    *   Block 8 (Green long)\n    *   Block 11 (Yellow Long)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 3\n    Step11: Move block with index 10\n    Step12: Move block with index 12\n    Step13: Move block with index 10\n    Step14: Move block with index 10\n    Step15: Move block with index 8\n    Step16: Move block with index 8\n    Step17: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n"

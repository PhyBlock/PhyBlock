It uses 9 blocks and is 4 layers high (3 layers of rectangular blocks, then a 1-layer roof). There is also an unrelated red block with a hole.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** The base has two blocks. There is an orange square block and a green square block, side-by-side.\n    *   **Second Layer:** The second layer has a square orange block on top of the orange square block of the first layer, and a square blue block on top of the green square block of the first layer, aligned directly above the first layer.\n    *   **Third Layer:** The third layer has a square orange block, with a yellow block on top of it.\n    *   **Roof:** The roof consists of three triangular blocks. The central triangular block sits above the yellow square block and the other two are placed symmetrically next to it. The two triangular roof blocks are orange. The center block is orange as well. The unrelated red block with a hole is separate from the house structure and sits on the left.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Block Indices:\n    *   Block 7 (orange square block): 3 times\n    *   Block 6 (green square block): 1 time\n    *   Block 5 (blue square block): 1 time\n    *   Block 9 (yellow square block): 1 time\n    *   Block 13 (orange triangular block): 3 times\n    *   Block 2 (red block with hole): 1 time\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n    Step10: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

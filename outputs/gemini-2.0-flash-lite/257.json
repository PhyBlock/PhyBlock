Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 19 blocks across 3 primary sections: a house, a bridge, and an orange-log-like base supporting the house.\n    *   The house has 3 blocks, the orange base has 3 blocks, the bridge section has 13 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The structure has three main parts.\n    *   The base of the house is 2 orange logs parallel to each other.\n    *   On top of the logs is a yellow rectangular block, and on top of the yellow block is a blue cube.\n    *   On top of the blue cube is an orange triangular prism, like a house roof.\n    *   The bridge has two main parts which are connected by a horizontal yellow rectangle.\n    *   The bridge parts are on the right and consist of 4 blocks each, stacked on top of each other with a yellow block in the middle.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Block Index List:\n    *   Block 11 (x2): orange cylinders\n    *   Block 13 (x1): orange cylinder\n    *   Block 10 (x1): yellow rectangle\n    *   Block 6 (x1): blue cube\n    *   Block 14 (x1): orange triangle prism\n    *   Block 9 (x1): yellow rectangle\n    *   Block 1 (x4): red arch block (bridge support)\n    *   Block 10 (x2): yellow rectangle (bridge supports)\n    *   Block 1 (x1): red arch block (bridge top)\n    *   Block 10 (x1): yellow rectangle (bridge support)\n    *   Block 1 (x4): red arch block (bridge support)\n    *   Block 1 (x2): red arch block (bridge top)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 1\n    Step12: Move block with index 10\n    Step13: Move block with index 1\n    Step14: Move block with index 1\n    Step15: Move block with index 9\n    Step16: Move block with index 1\n    Step17: Move block with index 10\n    Step18: Move block with index 1\n    Step19: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n"

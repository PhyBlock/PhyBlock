On top of the green block, a yellow block is placed.\n            *   Layer 3: Two green blocks are placed adjacent to one another on top of the yellow blocks.\n            *   Layer 4: The structure is completed with an orange block.\n        *   **Structure 2 (Right Side):**\n            *   Layer 1: The bottom layer consists of two red blocks side by side and a yellow vertical block.\n            *   Layer 2: The second layer has two blue blocks with the yellow vertical block.\n            *   Layer 3: Two green blocks.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   **Required Blocks:**\n        *   Block 1 (x2)\n        *   Block 2 (x1)\n        *   Block 3 (x1)\n        *   Block 4 (x2)\n        *   Block 5 (x2)\n        *   Block 6 (x1)\n        *   Block 7 (x1)\n        *   Block 9 (x2)\n        *   Block 10 (x1)\n        *   Block 11 (x1)\n        *   Block 13 (x1)\n        *   Block 14 (x1)\n        *   Block 15 (x1)\n    *   **Matching Criteria:** All blocks were selected based on their orientation and color, matching the target image precisely.\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    ```\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 1\n        Step2: Move block with index 2\n        Step3: Move block with index 3\n        Step4: Move block with index 1\n        Step5: Move block with index 4\n        Step6: Move block with index 5\n        Step7: Move block with index 5\n        Step8: Move block with index 7\n        Step9: Move block with index 6\n        Step10: Move block with index 9\n        Step11: Move block with index 9\n        Step12: Move block with index 15\n        Step13: Move block with index 10\n        Step14: Move block with index 13\n        Step15: Move block with index 4\n        Step16: Move block with index 14\n        Step17: Move block with index 11\n    }\n    ```\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The target image shows two distinct structures.\n    *   Structure 1: This structure has 3 layers. It is composed of 6 blocks.\n    *   Structure 2: This structure has 3 layers. It is composed of 8 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Structure 1:\n        *   Layer 1: Two wedge shaped blocks on the bottom, with the angled sides on the outside.\n        *   Layer 2: A cylindrical block placed above two wedge shaped blocks. The cylindrical block is located at the center and is placed on the top of the block.\n        *   Layer 3: A roof-shaped block is placed on the top of the cylindrical block. A yellow block is placed on each side of the roof-shaped block.\n    *   Structure 2:\n        *   Layer 1: Three arch shaped blocks forming the base\n        *   Layer 2: A cylindrical block placed at the center, with a yellow rectangular block placed to the left.\n        *   Layer 3: A roof-shaped block placed on the top of the cylindrical block. A yellow block is placed to the left and a green block is placed to the right.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   Structure 1:\n    *   Block 15 (x2) - wedge shaped, angled up.\n    *   Block 11 (x1) - cylindrical\n    *   Block 16 (x1) - roof-shaped block\n    *   Block 12 (x2) - yellow arc shaped blocks.\n*   Structure 2:\n    *   Block 2 (x3) - red arch shaped.\n    *   Block 11 (x1) - cylindrical.\n    *   Block 8 (x1) - yellow rectangle.\n    *   Block 16 (x1) - roof-shaped block.\n    *   Block 6 (x1) - green rectangle.\n    *   Block 8 (x1) - yellow rectangle.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 15\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 16\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 16\n    Step13: Move block with index 8\n    Step14: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n"

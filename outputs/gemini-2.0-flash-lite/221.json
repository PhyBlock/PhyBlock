The first has 5 blocks, and it is 3 layers tall. The second structure has 8 blocks and is 5 layers tall.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:**\n        *   The bottom layer consists of two blue blocks (likely blocks 3 and 8), and a yellow block on top (block 11).\n        *   The second layer is a red arch block (block 2).\n        *   The top layer is a roof-shaped orange block (block 14).\n    *   **Structure 2:**\n        *   The bottom layer has two horizontal yellow blocks (block 11).\n        *   The second layer consists of a red block with a hole (block 1) on top of the yellow blocks.\n        *   The third layer consists of two horizontal yellow blocks (block 11).\n        *   The fourth layer is made up of a red block (block 6) and a blue block (block 7). On top of these two blocks is a green block (block 4).\n        *   The top layer is an orange roof-shaped block (block 14).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 3 (Blue Cube)\n    *   Block 8 (Blue Cube)\n    *   Block 11 (Yellow Rectangular)\n    *   Block 2 (Red Arch)\n    *   Block 14 (Orange Roof-shaped)\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 11 (Yellow Rectangular)\n    *   Block 1 (Red block with hole)\n    *   Block 11 (Yellow Rectangular)\n    *   Block 6 (Red Cube)\n    *   Block 7 (Blue Cube)\n    *   Block 4 (Green Cube)\n    *   Block 14 (Orange Roof-shaped)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 3\n      Step2: Move block with index 8\n      Step3: Move block with index 11\n      Step4: Move block with index 2\n      Step5: Move block with index 14\n      Step6: Move block with index 11\n      Step7: Move block with index 11\n      Step8: Move block with index 1\n      Step9: Move block with index 11\n      Step10: Move block with index 11\n      Step11: Move block with index 6\n      Step12: Move block with index 7\n      Step13: Move block with index 4\n      Step14: Move block with index 14\n    }\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 9 blocks across three layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Structure 1: Two green blocks (5 and 6) form the base. On top of the green blocks, two yellow blocks (9 and 10) are placed horizontally, and on top of the yellow blocks, an orange cylinder (11) is placed vertically. Finally a yellow arch (12) is placed on top of the orange cylinder.\n    *   Structure 2: Two red arched blocks (2) form the base. On top of the red blocks, a yellow block (10) is placed horizontally, and on top of the yellow block, a yellow arch (12) is placed.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Identified Blocks:**\n    *   Block 5: green rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n    *   Block 6: green rectangular block in a vertical orientation.\n    *   Block 9: yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n    *   Block 10: yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n    *   Block 11: orange cylinder.\n    *   Block 12: yellow arch.\n    *   Block 2: red arched block.\n\n*   **Block Indices:** 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 11\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n"

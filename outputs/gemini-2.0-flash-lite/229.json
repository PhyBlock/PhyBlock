Let's analyze them separately.\n    *   **Structure 1:** This structure has 10 blocks and 4 layers. The first layer has the yellow blocks. The second layer has the orange blocks. The third layer has a red arched block and a blue block. The fourth layer has the green and orange blocks.\n    *   **Structure 2:** This structure has 6 blocks and 3 layers. The first layer has the two green blocks. The second layer has the yellow block. The third layer has the red arch block and two orange triangular blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:** The first layer consists of two yellow rectangular blocks, base layer. A red, curved block sits between the two yellow blocks in the second layer, overhanging and touching the edges of both blocks. An orange, rectangular block sits on top of a yellow one. A blue cube sits on top of the red curved block, as well as an orange rectangular block. A green block is also on top of the red arched block. The remaining orange triangular block is positioned on top of the yellow blocks.\n    *   **Structure 2:** Two green rectangular blocks form the base layer. A yellow rectangular block sits on top of both green blocks in the second layer. A red arched block is placed on top of the yellow block. Two orange triangular blocks are placed on top of the red arched block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 6 (x2 - yellow)\n    *   Block 2 (x1 - red)\n    *   Block 3 (x1 - blue)\n    *   Block 12 (x2 - orange)\n    *   Block 4 (x1 - green)\n    *   Block 14 (x1 - orange)\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 7 (x2 - green)\n    *   Block 11 (x1 - yellow)\n    *   Block 1 (x1 - red)\n    *   Block 13 (x2 - orange)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Structure 1:**\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n   Step6: Move block with index 3\n   Step7: Move block with index 4\n   Step8: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** There are 14 blocks and both structures have three layers. The left structure is made of two additional layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n        *   **Layer 1 (Base):**  Two curved yellow blocks side-by-side, and a single blue block on top.\n        *   **Layer 2:** A yellow block on top of the blue block, and two red blocks on top of the yellow block.\n        *   **Layer 3:** A green block on top of the red blocks, and an orange triangle block on top of the green block.\n        *   **Layer 4:** A red block on top of the yellow block.\n        *   **Layer 5:** A red block on top of the red block.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n        *   **Layer 1 (Base):** A blue block and an orange block.\n        *   **Layer 2:** A red block on top of the blue and orange blocks.\n        *   **Layer 3:** A green block on top of the red blocks, and an orange triangle block on top of the green block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Block Index 11 (Yellow curved block) x2\n    *   Block Index 3 (Blue Cube) x2\n    *   Block Index 9 (Yellow Rectangular Block) x1\n    *   Block Index 1 (Red Block with curve) x2\n    *   Block Index 4 (Green rectangular block) x2\n    *   Block Index 14 (Orange Triangular Block) x2\n    *   Block Index 10 (Yellow block) x1\n    *   Block Index 2 (Red block with curve) x2\n    *   Block Index 5 (Orange Cube) x1\n*   **Important:**  The blocks need to be in the exact orientation they are in in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n    Step11: Move block with index 10\n    Step12: Move block with index 2\n    Step13: Move block with index 2\n    Step14: Move block with index 5\n    Step15: Move block with index 14\n\n}\n```\n"

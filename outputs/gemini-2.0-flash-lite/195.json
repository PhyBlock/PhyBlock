Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:**\n    *   The target image shows two structures: a chair and a house.\n    *   **Chair:**\n        *   It appears to have 8 blocks.\n        *   It has 3 layers: 2 legs, a seat, and a back.\n    *   **House:**\n        *   It appears to have 8 blocks.\n        *   It has 4 layers: 2 base blocks, 3 block structure and a roof.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Chair:**\n        *   Two green blocks serve as legs.\n        *   A yellow block sits horizontally on top of the legs, forming the seat.\n        *   Above the seat, from bottom to top, there are blocks: a red block, a blue block, and a yellow arched block.\n    *   **House:**\n        *   Two blue rectangular blocks are positioned to form the base.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the two blue base blocks.\n        *   On top of the yellow block, there is a red block, a green block, and a blue block.\n        *   An orange triangular block is on top of the blue block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Chair Blocks:**\n    *   Index 6 (2 blocks)\n    *   Index 8 (1 block)\n    *   Index 3 (1 block)\n    *   Index 1 (1 block)\n    *   Index 9 (1 block)\n*   **House Blocks:**\n    *   Index 4 (2 blocks)\n    *   Index 8 (1 block)\n    *   Index 3 (1 block)\n    *   Index 5 (1 block)\n    *   Index 1 (1 block)\n    *   Index 13 (1 block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   {\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 8\n    Step11: Move block with index 3\n    Step12: Move block with index 5\n    Step13: Move block with index 1\n    Step14: Move block with index 13\n    }\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The target image displays a structure composed of 22 blocks, arranged in 4 distinct groupings:\n    *   **Group 1 (Left):** A structure comprised of 4 blocks, consisting of: 1 red arch, 1 green block, 1 blue cube, and 1 red roof. It forms 3 layers.\n    *   **Group 2 (Middle):** 5 Blocks including: 1 orange cylindrical base, 1 orange cylindrical middle section, 1 orange roof block. It is a 3 layer structure.\n    *   **Group 3 (Right):** 7 blocks consisting of: 3 orange cylindrical bases, 2 yellow rectangular blocks, 2 orange roof blocks. It is a 3 layer structure.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Group 1:** The red arch is at the bottom, the green block sits on top of the arch, the blue cube is on top of the green block, and the red roof is on top of the blue cube.\n    *   **Group 2:** The orange cylindrical block is at the bottom, another orange cylinder is placed on top, with an orange triangular roof resting on the top of the second cylinder.\n    *   **Group 3:** Three orange cylinders act as supports, with two yellow blocks resting horizontally on them, and two triangular orange roof blocks above.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   Block 1: 1\n    *   Block 2: 6\n    *   Block 3: 3\n    *   Block 4: 14\n    *   Block 5: 10\n    *   Block 6: 10\n    *   Block 7: 14\n    *   Block 8: 10\n    *   Block 9: 8\n    *   Block 10: 8\n    *   Block 11: 14\n    *   Block 12: 10\n    *   Block 13: 10\n    *   Block 14: 14\n    *   Block 15: 10\n    *   Block 16: 7\n    *   Block 17: 7\n    *   Block 18: 14\n    *   Block 19: 14\n    *   Block 20: 13\n    *   Block 21: 13\n    *   Block 22: 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 8\n    Step10: Move block with index 8\n    Step11: Move block with index 14\n    Step12: Move block with index 10\n    Step13: Move block with index 10\n    Step14: Move block with index 14\n    Step15: Move block with index 10\n    Step16: Move block with index 7\n    Step17: Move block with index 7\n    Step18: Move block with index 14\n    Step19: Move block with index 14\n    Step20: Move block with index 13\n    Step21: Move block with index 13\n    Step22: Move block with index 1\n}\n```"

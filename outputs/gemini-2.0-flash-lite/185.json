Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 16 blocks and has 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Includes 4 orange cylindrical blocks that serve as legs. Two red arch blocks on the left. A yellow rectangular block is on the right connecting to the orange cylinders.\n    *   Layer 2: Three green blocks are stacked next to each other on the left side. The yellow rectangular block from Layer 1 is continued to the right side. The blue block is stacked on top of the yellow block.\n    *   Layer 3: The blue block.\n    *   Layer 4 (Top): A yellow semi-circular block that is stacked on top of the blue block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis of the main image, here is the list of indices:\n    *   Block 11:  Four Orange Cylindrical blocks\n    *   Block 2:  Two Red Arch Blocks\n    *   Block 10: Two Yellow Rectangular Blocks\n    *   Block 7:  Three Green Rectangular Blocks\n    *   Block 4:  One Blue Cube\n    *   Block 12: One Yellow Semi-Circular Block\n*   **List Block Indices:** [11, 11, 11, 11, 2, 2, 10, 10, 7, 7, 7, 4, 12]\n\n**3.

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of two main sections.\n    *   **Section 1 (Left Side):** Has 3 layers, and 14 blocks.\n    *   **Section 2 (Right Side):** Has 3 layers, and 3 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Section 1:**\n        *   The base layer consists of two arched red blocks, similar to a bridge design.\n        *   The middle layer has two arch-shaped blocks and two blocks.\n        *   The top layer has three tall blocks.\n    *   **Section 2:**\n        *   A Red cube base with a hole inside\n        *   A green flat block inside the hole\n        *   Another Red cube on top of the green block\n        *   \n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Section 1:**\n    *   Block 1 - index 2 (Red Arch Block, Left)\n    *   Block 2 - index 2 (Red Arch Block, Left)\n    *   Block 3 - index 14 (Yellow Half Circle Block)\n    *   Block 4 - index 14 (Yellow Half Circle Block)\n    *   Block 5 - index 5 (Blue Cube)\n    *   Block 6 - index 6 (Orange Cube)\n    *   Block 7 - index 8 (Green Tall Block)\n    *   Block 8 - index 11 (Yellow Tall Block)\n    *   Block 9 - index 11 (Yellow Tall Block)\n    *   Block 10 - index 12 (Yellow Block)\n    *   Block 11 - index 8 (Green Tall Block)\n    *   Block 12 - index 10 (Green Block)\n    *   Block 13 - index 10 (Green Block)\n    *   Block 14 - index 12 (Yellow Block)\n\n*   **Section 2:**\n    *   Block 15 - index 1 (Red Block)\n    *   Block 16 - index 1 (Red Block)\n    *   Block 17 - index 7 (Green Block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 11\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 10\n    Step13: Move block with index 10\n    Step14: Move block with index 12\n    Step15: Move block with index 1\n    Step16: Move block with index 7\n    Step17: Move block with index 1\n}\n```"

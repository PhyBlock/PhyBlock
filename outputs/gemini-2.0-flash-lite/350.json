The left structure is composed of 8 blocks and has 4 layers. The right structure is composed of 7 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   Bottom Layer: One yellow rectangular block (9 or 10)\n        *   Second Layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks (12) placed on top of the rectangular block, with two yellow rectangular blocks on top of these cylindrical blocks (9 or 10).\n        *   Third Layer: One blue cube block (6) placed on top of the yellow rectangular blocks. Then a red arched block on top of the blue cube block (2).\n        *   Top Layer: One orange triangular block (14) on top of the red arched block.\n    *   **Right Structure:**\n        *   Bottom Layer: Two red arched blocks (2), and a green rectangular block (7).\n        *   Second Layer: One orange cylindrical block (12) placed on top of the red arch blocks, and one yellow rectangular block (10) placed on top of the green rectangular block.\n        *   Top Layer: One orange triangular block (14) on top of the orange cylinder.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis of the main target image, the following blocks are required:\n    *   Block 2: Red arched block (x3)\n    *   Block 6: Blue cube (x1)\n    *   Block 7: Green rectangular block (x1)\n    *   Block 9: Yellow rectangular block (x2)\n    *   Block 10: Yellow rectangular block (x2)\n    *   Block 12: Orange cylindrical block (x3)\n    *   Block 14: Orange triangular block (x2)\n*   **List Block Indices:** 2, 6, 7, 9, 9, 10, 10, 12, 12, 12, 14, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 7\n    Step11: Move block with index 10\n    Step12: Move block with index 12\n    Step13: Move block with index 14\n    Step14: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

The structure on the right has 11 blocks and 5 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n        *   Layer 1: Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed adjacent to each other in a horizontal orientation.\n        *   Layer 2: A red block with a semi-circular cutout is centered on top of the yellow blocks.\n        *   Layer 3: Two orange cylindrical blocks stand vertically on either side of the red cutout.\n        *   Layer 4: A red triangular block is placed on top of the orange cylinders.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n        *   Layer 1: Green and blue blocks, and a yellow block are placed side-by-side in a row\n        *   Layer 2: A Red block is placed on the right edge of the bottom row\n        *   Layer 3: An orange cylindrical block supports the structure.\n        *   Layer 4: A red block with a semi-circular cutout is placed on top of the other blocks.\n        *   Layer 5: Two yellow blocks with a curved surface are placed next to each other.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block Index 9 (yellow rectangular block): 2 times\n    *   Block Index 3 (red block with a semi-circular cutout): 1 time\n    *   Block Index 10 (orange cylinder): 2 times\n    *   Block Index 14 (red triangular prism): 1 time\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block Index 8 (green rectangular block): 1 time\n    *   Block Index 5 (blue square block): 1 time\n    *   Block Index 7 (yellow square block): 1 time\n    *   Block Index 6 (red square block): 1 time\n    *   Block Index 10 (orange cylinder): 1 time\n    *   Block Index 3 (red block with a semi-circular cutout): 1 time\n    *   Block Index 11 (yellow semi-circular block): 2 times\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 6\n    Step11: Move block with index 10\n    Step12: Move block with index 3\n    Step13: Move block with index 11\n    Step14: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n"

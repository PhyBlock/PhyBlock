Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 20 blocks across 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):**\n        *   Two cylindrical orange blocks arranged horizontally side-by-side form the base of the car.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block is placed on top of these two cylinders.\n        *   A blue cube is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n        *   Two red arch blocks are placed side by side.\n    *   **Layer 2:**\n        *   Two yellow half-circle blocks are on top of the two red arch blocks.\n        *   One green rectangular block is on the top of the structure.\n        *   Two yellow rectangular block are next to the green block.\n    *   **Layer 3:**\n        *   One yellow rectangular block placed on top of the two yellow half-circle blocks and next to the green block.\n        *   One green rectangular block placed on top of the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Block Indices:** 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15.\n*   **Index Breakdown:**\n    *   Block Index 2: Used two times. (red arch)\n    *   Block Index 6: Used once. (orange cube)\n    *   Block Index 7: Used once. (green block)\n    *   Block Index 9: Used once. (green block)\n    *   Block Index 11: Used once. (yellow block)\n    *   Block Index 12: Used twice (yellow blocks)\n    *   Block Index 14: Used two times. (orange block)\n    *   Block Index 15: Used twice (yellow half circle)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n    Step12: Move block with index 12\n}\n```"

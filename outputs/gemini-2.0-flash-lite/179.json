Additionally, there are 3 more blocks on the side.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally, parallel to each other.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two orange cylindrical blocks stand upright, placed on top of the yellow blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3:** Two yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally, parallel to each other and connecting the cylindrical blocks. A blue cube is placed on top.\n    *   **Layer 4:** A red arch block is placed on top of the blue cube.\n    *   **Layer 5:** A red triangular block is placed on top of the arch.\n    *   **Side Structure:** One blue cube, and two orange triangular blocks are placed in a 3-block structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the target image analysis, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n    *   2 x Yellow rectangle, horizontal (Block 8)\n    *   2 x Orange cylinders (Block 9)\n    *   2 x Yellow rectangles, horizontal (Block 8)\n    *   1 x Blue cube (Block 4)\n    *   1 x Red Arch (Block 2)\n    *   1 x Red Triangle (Block 15)\n    *   1 x Blue cube (Block 4)\n    *   2 x Orange Triangle (Block 16)\n\n*   **List Block Indices:**\n    *   Block 8\n    *   Block 9\n    *   Block 8\n    *   Block 4\n    *   Block 2\n    *   Block 15\n    *   Block 4\n    *   Block 16\n    *   Block 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 4\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 4\n    Step11: Move block with index 16\n    Step12: Move block with index 16\n}\n```"

Structure 1 (left) is composed of 3 blocks and has one layer. Structure 2 (right) is composed of 8 blocks and has 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:** Two red blocks are adjacent, forming a base for the blue block. The blue block is placed on top and between the two red blocks.\n    *   **Structure 2:** The base layer of the structure is composed of two yellow blocks. Above those are two orange cylindrical blocks. The third layer is composed of a single yellow block. Two red arch blocks form the fourth layer and are placed above the two orange cylindrical blocks. Finally, an orange triangular block sits on top of each red arch block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block index 2 (red arch) - x2\n    *   Block index 6 (blue cube) - x1\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block index 10 (yellow rectangle) - x2\n    *   Block index 12 (orange cylinder) - x2\n    *   Block index 9 (yellow rectangle) - x1\n    *   Block index 1 (red arch) - x2\n    *   Block index 14 (orange triangle) - x2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 9\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 14\n    Step12: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

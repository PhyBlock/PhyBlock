There are three distinct structures that can be observed, a structure with 3 blocks on the left, one with 7 blocks on the right and one with 4 blocks on the right.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:** There is an orange cylinder at the base and the top. Two yellow blocks are bridging across the 2 orange pillars.\n    *   **Middle Structure:** There are two red arch-shaped blocks at the bottom, two yellow rectangular blocks on top of those.\n    *   **Right Structure:** There are two red arch-shaped blocks at the bottom, two yellow rectangular blocks on top of those.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Block Index 7 (orange cylinder): 3 times\n    *   Block Index 4 (yellow rectangular): 4 times\n    *   Block Index 2 (red arch): 2 times\n    *   Block Index 11 (orange triangle): 1 time\n    *   Block Index 16 (orange triangle): 1 time\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7\n  Step2: Move block with index 7\n  Step3: Move block with index 4\n  Step4: Move block with index 4\n  Step5: Move block with index 7\n  Step6: Move block with index 2\n  Step7: Move block with index 2\n  Step8: Move block with index 4\n  Step9: Move block with index 4\n  Step10: Move block with index 11\n  Step11: Move block with index 16\n}\n```"

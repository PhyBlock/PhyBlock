Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **12 blocks** in total.\n    *   It has **3 distinct layers**.\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of 6 blocks - 3 yellow rectangular blocks and 3 orange cylindrical blocks.\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle Layer):** Consists of 3 yellow rectangular blocks.\n        *   **Layer 3 (Top Layer):** Consists of 3 red blocks - 1 arch block and 2 angled blocks forming a roof shape.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Three yellow rectangular blocks are laid out horizontally as a base, side-by-side. Three orange cylindrical blocks are placed on top of these yellow blocks, one cylinder on each yellow block, positioned centrally along the length of the yellow blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Three yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of the cylindrical blocks from the first layer. They are oriented in the same direction as the base layer yellow blocks and positioned to span across the cylindrical supports.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A red arch block is placed centrally on top of the middle yellow rectangular blocks. Two red angled blocks are positioned on either side of the arch block, creating a roof-like structure. The angled blocks are oriented to slope inwards towards the arch.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the base layer yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal): **Block index 6** (Needed 3 times)\n    *   For the orange cylindrical blocks (vertical): **Block index 10** (Needed 3 times)\n    *   For the middle layer yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal): **Block index 6** (Needed 3 times)\n    *   For the red arch block (horizontal orientation, opening downwards): **Block index 1** (Needed 1 time)\n    *   For the red angled block (slanted to the right, as seen from front perspective): **Block index 14** (Needed 1 time)\n    *   For the red angled block (slanted to the left, as seen from front perspective): **Block index 13** (Needed 1 time)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 6, 10, 6, 10, 6, 10, 6, 6, 6, 1, 14, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inferred Assembly Sequence:** Building from the bottom layer upwards is the most logical approach.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

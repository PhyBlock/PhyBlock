Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- **Count:** 9 blocks\n- **Layers:** 2 layers\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Base):** Consists of four orange wedge blocks arranged to form a square base. The wedge blocks are oriented such that the sloping sides face outwards.\n    - **Layer 2 (Top):** Placed on top of the square base. It has a central green square block surrounded by four blue square blocks, one on each side of the green block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Count:** 5 blocks\n- **Layers:** 5 layers\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red arch block forms the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** A green rectangular block is placed directly on top of the red arch block, oriented lengthwise along the arch.\n    - **Layer 3:** A yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the green rectangular block, with the same orientation.\n    - **Layer 4:** An orange rectangular block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, again with the same orientation.\n    - **Layer 5 (Top):** An orange cylinder is placed vertically on top of the orange rectangular block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Orange Wedge Blocks (Base): Blocks 12, 13, 14, 15 (Used in a configuration to form a square base as seen in the target image. We will assume a clockwise placement starting from the bottom right wedge in the target image for assembly step order). Specifically, using blocks 15, 12, 13, 14 in clockwise order seems to match the base formation.\n- Green Square Block (Center): Block 3\n- Blue Square Blocks (Surrounding): Block 2 (x4)\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Red Arch Block (Base): Block 1\n- Green Rectangular Block: Block 6\n- Yellow Rectangular Block: Block 7\n- Orange Rectangular Block: Block 8\n- Orange Cylinder Block: Block 9\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 15\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n    Step12: Move block with index 7\n    Step13: Move block with index 8\n    Step14: Move block with index 9\n }"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 4 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red arch block forms the base.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** A yellow curved block is placed on top of the red arch. A blue rectangular block is positioned behind the arch, adjacent to the yellow curved block and resting on the base level.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange triangular roof block is placed on top, spanning across the blue rectangular block and partially covering the yellow curved block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 6 blocks and has 4 layers if considering the blue block adjacent to the base, or 4 layers if considering the top roof layer.  Let's consider it 4 layers stacked vertically with one adjacent block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** An orange square block forms the base. Adjacent to this base block is a blue square block, positioned at the same level.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A red arch block is placed on top of the orange square base block.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A green rectangular block is placed on top of the red arch block.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange triangular roof block is placed on top, spanning across the green rectangular block and partially covering the red arch block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**For Structure 1 (Left):**\n*   Red Arch Block: **Index 1**\n*   Yellow Curved Block: **Index 8**\n*   Blue Rectangular Block: **Index 4**\n*   Orange Triangular Roof Block: **Index 13**\n\n**For Structure 2 (Right):**\n*   Orange Square Block (Base): **Index 5**\n*   Blue Square Block (Adjacent to base): **Index 4**\n*   Red Arch Block: **Index 1**\n*   Green Rectangular Block: **Index 6**\n*   Orange Triangular Roof Block: **Index 13**\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\nFor Structure 1: 1, 8, 4, 13\nFor Structure 2: 5, 4, 1, 6, 13\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 1 (Left):**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 2 (Right):**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

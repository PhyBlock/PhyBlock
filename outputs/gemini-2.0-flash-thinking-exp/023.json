Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **8 blocks** in total.\n    - It has **5 layers**.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of two red arch blocks placed side-by-side, forming a base. The arches of these blocks are facing inwards, creating a small gap between them at the bottom.\n    - **Layer 2:** A single yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two red arch blocks in the center, spanning across both.\n    - **Layer 3:** Two green cube blocks are placed side-by-side on top of the yellow rectangular block, positioned centrally.\n    - **Layer 4:** A single red arch block is placed on top of the two green cube blocks. This arch block is oriented perpendicularly to the arch blocks in the bottom layer, with its arch facing inwards along the shorter dimension of the layer below.\n    - **Layer 5 (Top Layer):** Consists of two orange triangular prism blocks placed on top of the red arch block. They are positioned adjacent to each other, forming a pointed roof-like shape at the apex of the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For Layer 1 (Red Arch Blocks): Block with index **1** (used twice).\n    - For Layer 2 (Yellow Rectangular Block): Block with index **9**.\n    - For Layer 3 (Green Cube Blocks): Block with index **6** (used twice).\n    - For Layer 4 (Red Arch Block): Block with index **2**.\n    - For Layer 5 (Orange Triangular Prism Blocks): Block with index **14** and Block with index **15**.\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 9, 6, 6, 2, 14, 15\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All selected block indices correspond to blocks in the dictionary that match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No rotation is needed, and blocks are used as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```"

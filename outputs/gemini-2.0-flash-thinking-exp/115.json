Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure in the Main Target Image is composed of **6 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of three blocks: two orange triangle blocks at the back and a blue square block at the front.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of two orange triangle blocks placed on top of the bottom layer triangle blocks, angled inwards.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of one green rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the middle layer triangle blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two orange triangle blocks in the bottom layer form a base at the back. They are placed adjacent to each other, with their longer sides touching.\n    *   The blue square block is placed in front of the center of the base formed by the two orange triangle blocks.\n    *   The two orange triangle blocks in the middle layer are positioned on top of the bottom layer triangle blocks, creating a pyramid-like shape. Their angled sides are facing upwards and inwards.\n    *   The green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two middle layer orange triangle blocks, spanning across them.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the bottom layer orange triangle blocks: **Block 12** (used twice).\n    *   For the blue square block: **Block 1** (used once).\n    *   For the middle layer orange triangle blocks: **Block 11** (used twice).\n    *   For the top layer green rectangular block: **Block 6** (used once).\n\n*   **List Block Indices:** 12, 12, 1, 11, 11, 6\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary precisely match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the Main Target Image. No rotations are needed; the blocks are used as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inferred Assembly Sequence:** Based on the structure and block selection, a possible assembly order is to start from the bottom layer and move upwards.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n}\n```"

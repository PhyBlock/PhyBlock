Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 7 blocks and has 4 distinct layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):**  A single red block with a semi-circular cutout forms the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side on top of the red base, spanning its width.\n    - **Layer 3:** Two red cylindrical blocks are positioned vertically on top of the yellow rectangular blocks. They are placed towards the edges of the yellow blocks, creating a gap in the middle.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top):** Two orange triangular prism blocks are placed on top of the red cylindrical blocks, angled inwards to form a peaked roof-like structure.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 5 blocks and has 3 distinct layers, though it visually extends higher due to vertical blocks.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A single green rectangular block forms the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** A single orange cylindrical block is placed vertically on top of the green base, positioned centrally.\n    - **Layer 3:** A single yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinder.\n    - **Layer 4:** A single green rectangular block is placed vertically on top of the yellow rectangular block, positioned at one end to create an L-shape when viewed from the top down and a U-shape from the front.\n    - **Layer 5 (Top):** A single orange triangular prism block is placed within the U-shape formed by the yellow and green rectangular blocks, resting on the yellow block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Red base with semi-circle: **Block 1**\n- Yellow rectangular block (horizontal): **Block 10** (x2)\n- Red cylindrical block (vertical): **Block 11** (x2)\n- Orange triangular prism block: **Block 16** (x2)\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Green rectangular block (horizontal): **Block 4**\n- Orange cylindrical block (vertical): **Block 15**\n- Yellow rectangular block (horizontal): **Block 10**\n- Green rectangular block (vertical): **Block 6**\n- Orange triangular prism block: **Block 16**\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The main target image shows two separate structures.\n    *   **Left Structure:** Consists of 2 blocks and has 2 layers.\n    *   **Right Structure:** Consists of 5 blocks and has 2 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): One red arch block.\n        *   Layer 2 (Top): A yellow cube block to the left and a blue cube block to the right, both placed on top of the red arch block.\n    *   **Right Structure:**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Two red arch blocks placed side-by-side horizontally.\n        *   Layer 2 (Top): Two yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the red arch blocks.\n        *   Layer 3 (Topmost): Two red arch blocks placed on top of the yellow rectangular blocks, aligning with the base red arch blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch Block (for both structures and all layers): Block index **1**\n    *   Yellow Cube Block (for the left structure, top layer): Block index **11**\n    *   Blue Cube Block (for the left structure, top layer): Block index **7**\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal, for the right structure, middle layer): Block index **12**\n\n*   **Block Indices List:** For constructing **both** structures as shown in the main target image, we need the following blocks and indices:\n    *   Block 1 (Red Arch): 5 times\n    *   Block 7 (Blue Cube): 1 time\n    *   Block 11 (Yellow Cube): 1 time\n    *   Block 12 (Yellow Rectangular): 2 times\n\n    If we are asked to construct **only the right structure** (which is more complex and possibly the intended target given the instructions), we only need:\n    *   Block 1 (Red Arch): 4 times\n    *   Block 12 (Yellow Rectangular): 2 times\n\n    Assuming the task is to build the **right structure** as it's more complex and prominent in the image, we will proceed with blocks for the right structure only.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the right structure, a possible assembly order is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1:** Place the first red arch block (index 1) as the base on the left.\n*   **Step 2:** Place the second red arch block (index 1) as the base on the right, adjacent to the first one.\n*   **Step 3:** Place the first yellow rectangular block (index 12) horizontally across the two base red arch blocks.\n*   **Step 4:** Place the second yellow rectangular block (index 12) horizontally next to the first one, also across the base red arch blocks.\n*   **Step 5:** Place the third red arch block (index 1) on top of the left yellow rectangular block, aligning with the base red arch.\n*   **Step 6:** Place the fourth red arch block (index 1) on top of the right yellow rectangular block, aligning with the base red arch.\n\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **7 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 orange cylinder blocks, laid horizontally and parallel to each other.\n    * **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 yellow rectangular blocks, placed side-by-side on top of the orange cylinders, forming a platform.\n    * **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 2 blocks: a blue cube and a red rectangular block, placed side-by-side on top of the yellow rectangular blocks. The blue cube is on the left and the red rectangular block is on the right.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The two orange cylinders are on the base level, acting as supports.\n    * The two yellow rectangular blocks are placed directly on top of and across the orange cylinders, creating a horizontal platform.\n    * The blue cube and the red rectangular block are positioned on top of the yellow platform, adjacent to each other. The blue cube is to the left and the red block to the right, when viewed from the front.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    * Orange Cylinder (bottom layer, left): **Index 13**\n    * Orange Cylinder (bottom layer, right): **Index 14**\n    * Yellow Rectangular Block (middle layer, left): **Index 6**\n    * Yellow Rectangular Block (middle layer, right): **Index 6**\n    * Blue Cube (top layer, left): **Index 1**\n    * Red Rectangular Block (top layer, right): **Index 4**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\"\n}\n```"

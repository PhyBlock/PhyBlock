Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 8 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 4 blocks (2 yellow, 2 red).\n    *   Layer 2 (Middle): 3 blocks (1 yellow, 2 red).\n    *   Layer 3 (Top): 1 block (orange).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side to form the base. Two red arch-shaped blocks are placed on either side of the yellow base, acting as supports.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the yellow base, spanning across the two base blocks. Two red arch-shaped blocks are placed on top of the red supports from the layer below.\n    *   **Layer 3:** An orange triangular prism block is placed on top of the red arch-shaped blocks of the second layer, in the center.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the yellow base (Layer 1): Block 5 (x2) - Horizontal yellow rectangular block.\n    *   For the red supports (Layer 1): Block 2 (x1) - Red arch block facing right, and Block 3 (x1) - Red arch block facing left.\n    *   For the yellow middle layer (Layer 2): Block 4 (x1) - Horizontal yellow rectangular block.\n    *   For the red arches in Layer 2: Block 2 (x1) - Red arch block facing right, and Block 3 (x1) - Red arch block facing left.\n    *   For the orange top (Layer 3): Block 12 (x1) - Orange triangular prism block.\n\n*   **List Block Indices:** 5, 5, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 12\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {5}\n    Step2: Move block with index {5}\n    Step3: Move block with index {2}\n    Step4: Move block with index {3}\n    Step5: Move block with index {4}\n    Step6: Move block with index {2}\n    Step7: Move block with index {3}\n    Step8: Move block with index {12}\n}"

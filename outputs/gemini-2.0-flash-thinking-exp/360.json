            "text": "## Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:\n\nThe Main Target Image displays two identical structures. Each structure is composed of:\n\n- **Number of Blocks:** 6 blocks per structure, totaling 12 blocks for both structures.\n- **Number of Layers:** 5 layers per structure.\n\n**Layer Breakdown for one structure (from bottom to top):**\n\n- **Layer 1:** Consists of two blue rectangular blocks placed side-by-side horizontally, forming the base.\n- **Layer 2:** A single yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of and across the two blue blocks.\n- **Layer 3:** A single red cube placed centrally on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n- **Layer 4:** A single green cube placed centrally on top of the red cube.\n- **Layer 5:** A single orange triangular prism (roof) placed centrally on top of the green cube.\n\n## Selection of Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nTo build one structure, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n- **Layer 1 (Blue Rectangular Blocks):** We need two horizontal blue rectangular blocks. Block index **6** from the dictionary matches this description. We need to use Block 6 twice.\n- **Layer 2 (Yellow Rectangular Block):** We need one horizontal yellow rectangular block. Block index **11** from the dictionary matches this description.\n- **Layer 3 (Red Cube):** We need one red cube. Block index **3** from the dictionary matches this description.\n- **Layer 4 (Green Cube):** We need one green cube. Block index **4** from the dictionary matches this description.\n- **Layer 5 (Orange Triangular Prism):** We need one orange triangular prism. Block index **13** from the dictionary matches this description.\n\nTherefore, for one structure, we need blocks with indices: 6, 6, 11, 3, 4, 13. For two structures, we will need these blocks twice.\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\nTo build both structures, we can assemble them sequentially. The assembly order for each structure is layer by layer, starting from the bottom layer.\n\n**Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

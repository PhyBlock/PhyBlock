The bottom layer consists of 3 blocks, and the top layer has 1 block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** A central cylindrical block is positioned vertically. Two wedge-shaped blocks are placed on either side of the base of the cylindrical block, angled outwards.\n    *   **Top Layer:** A U-shaped block is placed directly on top of the cylindrical block, oriented with the open part of the 'U' facing upwards. The cylindrical block acts as a central support for the U-shaped block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Vertical Cylinder (Orange, bottom layer center): **Block index 7**\n    *   Left Wedge Block (Orange, bottom layer left): **Block index 13**\n    *   Right Wedge Block (Orange, bottom layer right): **Block index 14**\n    *   U-shaped Block (Red, top layer): **Block index 1**\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary precisely match the shapes, colors, and orientations observed in the main target image. No rotations or adjustments were made; blocks were chosen exactly as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:**  We will assemble the structure layer by layer, starting from the bottom and moving upwards.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```"

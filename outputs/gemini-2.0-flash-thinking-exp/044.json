Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **11 blocks**.\n    - It has **3 layers**.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red block with a hole is laid horizontally. Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed on either side of the red block, on top, creating a base.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Another red block with a hole is placed directly on top of the first red block, maintaining the horizontal orientation. Two orange cylindrical blocks are positioned vertically on top of the base red block, within the space created by the lower yellow blocks. Two more yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of the second red block and the cylinders, forming a platform above.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange triangular block is placed centrally on the yellow platform of Layer 2. Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed vertically on the yellow platform, flanking the triangular block on either side.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Red block with hole (horizontal orientation): Index **2** (Used twice)\n    - Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation): Index **7** (Used four times)\n    - Orange cylinder (vertical orientation): Index **11** (Used twice)\n    - Orange triangular block: Index **15** (Used once)\n    - Yellow rectangular block (vertical orientation): Index **9** (Used twice)\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 2, 7, 7, 2, 11, 11, 7, 7, 15, 9, 9\n\n**3.

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n\n**Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image displays two distinct structures built from blocks.\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Structure):**\n*   **Block Count:** 6 blocks\n*   **Layers:** 5 layers\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of two red arch blocks, positioned side-by-side.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A single yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the two red arches, spanning across them.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A single green cube block placed centrally on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n    *   **Layer 4:** A single blue cube block placed centrally on top of the green cube block.\n    *   **Layer 5 (Top):** A single red triangular block placed centrally on top of the blue cube block, forming the peak of the structure.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is built vertically with each layer stacked directly on top of the previous one, except for the base layer which is composed of two adjacent blocks.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Structure):**\n*   **Block Count:** 3 blocks\n*   **Layers:** 2 layers\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of two orange cylindrical blocks, positioned side-by-side.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A single green rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the two orange cylindrical blocks, spanning across them.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**  Similar to Structure 1, the structure is built vertically. The top layer block is placed on top of the two adjacent blocks of the bottom layer.\n\n## 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\n\nTo build Structure 1 (Left):\n*   Red Arch (Base Layer): Index 2 (Used twice)\n*   Yellow Rectangle (Layer 2): Index 12\n*   Green Cube (Layer 3): Index 7\n*   Blue Cube (Layer 4): Index 6\n*   Red Triangle (Layer 5): Index 16\n\nTo build Structure 2 (Right):\n*   Orange Cylinder (Base Layer): Index 13 (Used twice)\n*   Green Rectangle (Layer 2): Index 10\n\n**Combined Block Indices List:** 2, 2, 12, 7, 6, 16, 13, 13, 10\n\n## 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 16\n   Step7: Move block with index 13\n   Step8: Move block with index 13\n   Step9: Move block with index 10\n}"

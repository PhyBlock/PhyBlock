Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **6 blocks** and has **4 layers**.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of two red arch blocks placed side-by-side, forming the base. The arches of these blocks are oriented upwards.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two red arch blocks from Layer 1, spanning across both of them.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A red arch block is placed centrally on top of the yellow rectangular block from Layer 2. The arch of this block is oriented downwards.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top Layer):** Consists of two orange triangular blocks placed on top of the red arch block from Layer 3, forming a roof shape. These triangular blocks are angled inwards to meet at the peak of the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For Layer 1 (Red Arch Blocks): We need two blocks of index **1**.\n    *   For Layer 2 (Yellow Rectangular Block): We need one block of index **7**.\n    *   For Layer 3 (Red Arch Block): We need one block of index **3**.\n    *   For Layer 4 (Orange Triangular Blocks): We need one block of index **15** and one block of index **16**.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 7, 3, 15, 16\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary precisely match the shape, color, and rotational orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No block rotation is needed or performed.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe Main Target Image displays two distinct structures made of building blocks.\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n    *   **Block Count:** 3 blocks\n    *   **Layers:** 3 layers\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A long green rectangular block is placed horizontally as the base.\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** An orange cylinder is placed directly on top and centered on the green rectangular block.\n        *   **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange cone is placed directly on top and centered on the orange cylinder.\n\n*   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n    *   **Block Count:** 7 blocks\n    *   **Layers:** 3 layers\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** An orange arch block forms the central base. Two orange wedge blocks are placed on either side of the arch, with their flat edges aligned with the arch's sides and their slanted edges facing outwards.\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** A green square block is placed on top of the left wedge and partially over the arch. A blue square block is placed on top of the right wedge and partially over the arch, adjacent to the green square.\n        *   **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange wedge block is placed on top of the green square, with its slanted edge pointing upwards and outwards. Another orange wedge block is placed on top of the blue square, mirroring the orientation of the first wedge block to form a roof-like structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1 Blocks:**\n    *   Green Rectangular Base: **Block Index 7** (horizontal green rectangle)\n    *   Orange Cylinder: **Block Index 11** (orange cylinder)\n    *   Orange Cone: **Block Index 12** (orange cone)\n\n*   **Structure 2 Blocks:**\n    *   Orange Arch: **Block Index 1** (orange arch)\n    *   Orange Wedge (Bottom Left): **Block Index 14** (orange wedge, angled to the left)\n    *   Orange Wedge (Bottom Right): **Block Index 15** (orange wedge, angled to the right)\n    *   Green Square: **Block Index 5** (green square)\n    *   Blue Square: **Block Index 4** (blue square)\n    *   Orange Wedge (Top Left): **Block Index 13** (orange wedge, angled to the left and upwards)\n    *   Orange Wedge (Top Right): **Block Index 16** (orange wedge, angled to the right and upwards)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the block selection and the layer structure, a possible assembly order is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

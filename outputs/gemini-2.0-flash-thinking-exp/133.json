Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **6 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 red arch blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 green rectangular blocks.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 2 yellow rectangular blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side on the ground level, forming the base.\n    *   Each green rectangular block is placed directly on top of a red arch block. They are also positioned side-by-side.\n    *   Each yellow rectangular block is placed directly on top of a green rectangular block. They are also positioned side-by-side, completing the structure.\n    *   All blocks are aligned in a linear fashion from left to right in the image's perspective.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   **Red Arch Block (Bottom Layer):** We need 2 red arch blocks that are oriented horizontally with the arch facing downwards. Block index **1** from the dictionary perfectly matches this description.\n    *   **Green Rectangular Block (Middle Layer):** We need 2 green rectangular blocks oriented vertically. Block index **10** from the dictionary matches this description.\n    *   **Yellow Rectangular Block (Top Layer):** We need 2 yellow rectangular blocks oriented vertically. Block index **14** from the dictionary matches this description.\n\n*   **List Block Indices:** [1, 1, 10, 10, 14, 14]\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** The assembly should proceed layer by layer, starting from the bottom layer and moving upwards.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Left Structure:**\n- **Count & Layers:** 7 blocks, approximately 2 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Bottom Layer (from left to right):** A vertical green rectangular block, an orange cylinder next to it, another vertical green rectangular block, and an orange triangle slope leaning towards the left.\n    - **Top Layer (from left to right):** An orange triangle slope placed on top of the first green rectangular block, another orange triangle slope placed on top of the orange cylinder, and a horizontal green rectangular block placed on top of the second green rectangular block.\n    - The first orange triangle slope in the top layer is oriented with its slope facing right.\n    - The second orange triangle slope in the top layer is oriented with its slope facing left.\n    - The horizontal green rectangular block in the top layer is placed on the rightmost vertical green rectangular block.\n\n**Right Structure:**\n- **Count & Layers:** 7 blocks, 5 layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (bottom):** A yellow cube.\n    - **Layer 2:** An orange cube and a blue cube placed side-by-side (orange on the left, blue on the right).\n    - **Layer 3:** A red cube and a vertical green rectangular block placed side-by-side (red on the left, green on the right).\n    - **Layer 4:** A blue cube and a red cube placed side-by-side (blue on the left, red on the right).\n    - **Layer 5 (top):** A green triangle slope placed on top, oriented with its slope facing right.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Left Structure Blocks:**\n- Block 1: Vertical green rectangular block - Index 8\n- Block 2: Orange cylinder - Index 10\n- Block 3: Vertical green rectangular block - Index 7\n- Block 4: Orange triangle slope (leaning left) - Index 13\n- Block 5: Orange triangle slope (slope right, for top of first green block) - Index 13\n- Block 6: Orange triangle slope (slope left, for top of cylinder) - Index 13\n- Block 7: Horizontal green rectangular block - Index 9\n\n**Right Structure Blocks:**\n- Block 1: Yellow cube - Index 5\n- Block 2: Orange cube - Index 3\n- Block 3: Blue cube - Index 1\n- Block 4: Red cube - Index 4\n- Block 5: Vertical green rectangular block - Index 7\n- Block 6: Blue cube - Index 1\n- Block 7: Green triangle slope (slope right) - Index 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 7\n   Step4: Move block with index 13\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n   Step6: Move block with index 13\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 5\n   Step9: Move block with index 3\n   Step10: Move block with index 1\n   Step11: Move block with index 4\n   Step12: Move block with index 7\n   Step13: Move block with index 1\n   Step14: Move block with index 4\n   Step15: Move block with index 14\n}"

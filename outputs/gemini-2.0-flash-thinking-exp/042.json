It appears to be a rectangular block with a semi-circular cutout facing upwards.\n        *   **Layer 2:** Three blocks are placed side-by-side on top of the base block. From left to right, they are: a horizontal green rectangular block, a horizontal yellow semi-circular block, and another horizontal green rectangular block.\n        *   **Layer 3:** A single red block is placed on top of the yellow semi-circular block from the layer below, centered above the base block. It appears to be a rectangular block with a semi-circular cutout facing downwards.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n    *   **Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n        *   For Layer 1 (Bottom): A red block with a semi-circular cutout facing upwards.\n        *   For Layer 2 (Middle):\n            *   A horizontal green rectangular block.\n            *   A horizontal yellow semi-circular block.\n            *   A horizontal green rectangular block.\n        *   For Layer 3 (Top): A red block with a semi-circular cutout facing downwards.\n    *   **List Block Indices:**\n        *   Layer 1: Block index **2**\n        *   Layer 2:\n            *   Block index **8**\n            *   Block index **12**\n            *   Block index **8**\n        *   Layer 3: Block index **1**\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n    *   **Inference of Order:** The assembly order should logically start from the bottom layer and proceed upwards.\n    *   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2\n  Step2: Move block with index 8\n  Step3: Move block with index 12\n  Step4: Move block with index 8\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n}\n```"

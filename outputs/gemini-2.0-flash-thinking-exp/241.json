It can be seen as having two separate substructures.\n    *   The left substructure is a tower with 5 layers.\n    *   The right substructure is lower and wider, with effectively 2 layers for the red base and a third layer for the blue block on top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Tower (Bottom to Top):**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Red curved block, oriented horizontally with the curve facing upwards.\n        *   Layer 2: Green rectangular block, oriented horizontally, placed directly on top of the red curved block.\n        *   Layer 3: Yellow square block, placed centrally on top of the green rectangular block.\n        *   Layer 4: Blue square block, placed centrally on top of the yellow square block.\n        *   Layer 5 (Top): Red curved block, oriented horizontally with the curve facing downwards, placed on top of the blue square block.\n    *   **Right Structure (Left to Right, Bottom to Top):**\n        *   Base Layer: Two red curved blocks, both oriented horizontally with the curve facing upwards, placed side-by-side.\n        *   Top Layer: Blue square block, placed centrally on top of the two red curved blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red curved block (horizontal, curve up): Block Index **1** (Used three times)\n    *   Red curved block (horizontal, curve down): Block Index **2** (Used once)\n    *   Blue square block: Block Index **8** (Used twice)\n    *   Green rectangular block (horizontal): Block Index **15** (Used once)\n    *   Yellow square block: Block Index **11** (Used once)\n\n*   **List Block Indices:** 1, 15, 11, 8, 2, 1, 1, 8\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 15\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n}\n```"

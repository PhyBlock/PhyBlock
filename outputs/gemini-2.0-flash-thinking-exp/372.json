Blocks in the same layer are placed adjacent to each other horizontally.\n\n**Arch-like Structure (Right Structure):**\n- **Block Count:** 6 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 yellow arch blocks, placed horizontally side-by-side, forming the base of the arch.\n    - Layer 2: 2 red arch blocks, placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the yellow arch blocks, aligned to support the upper layer.\n    - Layer 3 (Top): 2 red rectangular blocks, placed horizontally on top of the red arch blocks, bridging the gap to complete the arch.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** Arch blocks form the curved support, and rectangular blocks bridge across the top. Blocks within each layer are placed horizontally adjacent.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**For the Tower:**\n- Layer 1 (Yellow Rectangular): Block 13 (x2)\n- Layer 2 (Blue Rectangular): Block 8 (x2)\n- Layer 3 (Red Rectangular): Block 6 (x1) -  Using a red cube as a rectangular block in this orientation.\n- Layer 4 (Green Rectangular): Block 10 (x1)\n- Layer 5 (Orange Triangular): Block 16 (x1)\n\n**For the Arch-like Structure:**\n- Layer 1 (Yellow Arch): Block 1 (x2) - Assuming Block 1 represents the arch shape despite being red in the dictionary, as no yellow arch is present. Shape is prioritized.\n- Layer 2 (Red Arch): Block 2 (x2)\n- Layer 3 (Red Rectangular): Block 6 (x2) -  Using a red cube as a rectangular block.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 13, 13, 8, 8, 6, 10, 16, 1, 1, 2, 2, 6, 6\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 2\n    Step11: Move block with index 2\n    Step12: Move block with index 6\n    Step13: Move block with index 6\n}"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **11 blocks** and has a maximum of **4 layers** at the highest point.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   Base layer consists of two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks placed side-by-side and one red arch block placed centrally on top of them with its concave side facing upwards.\n        *   Top layer consists of two red arch blocks placed on top of the base layer, with their concave sides facing downwards, forming a bridge-like structure.\n    *   **Right Structure:**\n        *   Bottom layer consists of two vertical orange cylindrical blocks placed side-by-side.\n        *   Second layer is a horizontal yellow rectangular block placed on top of the two cylindrical blocks.\n        *   Third layer consists of two vertical orange cylindrical blocks placed on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n        *   Topmost point is an orange triangular prism placed on top of the upper cylindrical blocks.\n    *   The left and right structures are positioned separately from each other in the image.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Yellow Horizontal Rectangular Block: Index 4 (Used 3 times)\n    *   Red Arch Block (Concave Up): Index 2 (Used 1 time)\n    *   Red Arch Block (Concave Down): Index 1 (Used 2 times)\n    *   Orange Cylindrical Block (Vertical): Index 9 (Used 4 times)\n    *   Orange Triangular Prism: Index 16 (Used 1 time)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 4, 4, 2, 1, 1, 9, 9, 4, 9, 9, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 16\n}\n```"

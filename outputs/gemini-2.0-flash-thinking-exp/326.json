Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **8 blocks** in total.\n    - It has **3 layers** at its highest point (right side structure) and **2 layers** at its lowest point (left side structure).\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Left Structure (2 layers):**\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red semi-circular blocks are placed side-by-side horizontally on the ground.\n        - **Layer 2 (Top):** A blue cube is placed centrally on top of the two red semi-circular blocks.\n    - **Right Structure (3 layers):**\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Three red semi-circular blocks with circular holes are placed side-by-side horizontally on the ground, forming an arch shape.\n        - **Layer 2 (Middle):** A longer yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the three red semi-circular blocks, bridging across them.\n        - **Layer 3 (Top):** A shorter yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the longer yellow rectangular block, slightly shifted towards the back (in the image perspective).\n    - **Overall Arrangement:** The left and right structures are positioned separately, with a gap between them.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the left structure:\n        - Red semi-circular block (bottom layer): **Index 2** (used twice)\n        - Blue cube (top layer): **Index 9** (used once)\n    - For the right structure:\n        - Red semi-circular block with hole (bottom layer): **Index 6** (used three times)\n        - Longer yellow rectangular block (middle layer): **Index 14** (used once)\n        - Shorter yellow rectangular block (top layer): **Index 15** (used once)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 9, 6, 6, 6, 14, 15\n\n- **Matching Criteria Confirmation:**\n    - All selected block indices correspond to blocks in the dictionary that precisely match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No rotation is needed or applied.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n- **Inferred Assembly Sequence:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```"

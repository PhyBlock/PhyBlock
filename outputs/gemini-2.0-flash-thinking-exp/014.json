The central triangular block is positioned at the peak, with the other two slanting downwards on either side.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:** Based on the target image analysis, we need:\n    *   Three red curved blocks for the base.\n    *   Three orange triangular blocks for the roof.\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   For the base layer (red curved blocks): We will use **block index 1** three times.\n    *   For the central roof block (orange triangular): We will use **block index 11**.\n    *   For the left slanted roof block (orange triangular): We will use **block index 13**.\n    *   For the right slanted roof block (orange triangular): We will use **block index 12**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n}\n```"

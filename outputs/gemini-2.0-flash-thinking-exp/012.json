Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **10 blocks** and has **2 layers**.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):**\n        - Consists of five blocks.\n        - Four orange rectangular blocks are arranged in a cross shape. They are oriented horizontally to form the arms of the cross, extending along what we can consider the x and y axes.\n        - A blue square block is placed in the very center of the cross formed by the orange blocks.\n    - **Layer 2 (Top Layer):**\n        - Consists of five blocks, placed directly on top of the blocks from Layer 1.\n        - Four blue rectangular blocks are positioned on top of the orange rectangular blocks from the layer below, maintaining the cross shape. These blue blocks are oriented vertically, perpendicular to the orange blocks beneath them.\n        - A green square block is placed in the center, directly on top of the blue square block from Layer 1.\n\n## 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Block Indices:**\n    - For the four horizontal orange rectangular blocks in the bottom layer: **Block 9** (Orange Horizontal Rectangular) - needed 4 times.\n    - For the central blue square block in the bottom layer: **Block 1** (Blue Square) - needed 1 time.\n    - For the four vertical blue rectangular blocks in the top layer: **Block 7** (Blue Vertical Rectangular) - needed 4 times.\n    - For the central green square block in the top layer: **Block 2** (Green Square) - needed 1 time.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 1, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9\n\n- **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary perfectly match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks required in the Main Target Image. No rotation is needed or applied.\n\n## 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```"

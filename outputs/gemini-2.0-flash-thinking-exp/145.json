Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **6 blocks** in total.\n    - It is built in **4 layers**.\n    - Layer 1 (bottom layer): Contains 2 orange cylinder blocks.\n    - Layer 2: Contains 1 yellow rectangular block.\n    - Layer 3: Contains 2 orange cylinder blocks.\n    - Layer 4 (top layer): Contains 1 orange triangular prism block.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1:** Two orange cylinder blocks are placed side-by-side on the base, standing vertically.\n    - **Layer 2:** One yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two orange cylinders from Layer 1, spanning across both of them.\n    - **Layer 3:** Two orange cylinder blocks are stacked vertically on top of each other. This stack is positioned centrally on the yellow rectangular block, directly above the center of the two cylinder blocks in Layer 1.\n    - **Layer 4:** One orange triangular prism block is placed on top of the uppermost orange cylinder block from Layer 3, oriented such that its pointed end is facing upwards.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For Layer 1 (bottom cylinders): We need two vertical orange cylinders. Block index **4** from the dictionary matches this description.\n    - For Layer 2 (yellow rectangular block): We need a horizontal yellow rectangular block. Block index **1** from the dictionary matches this description.\n    - For Layer 3 (stacked cylinders): We need two more vertical orange cylinders. Block index **4** from the dictionary matches this description again.\n    - For Layer 4 (top triangular prism): We need an orange triangular prism pointing upwards. Block index **14** from the dictionary matches this description.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

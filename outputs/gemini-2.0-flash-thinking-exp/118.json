A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across the top of these cylinders, connecting them.\n        *   **Layer 2:** Another yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the first yellow block and one of the orange cylinders. A blue cube is placed adjacent to this second yellow block, resting on the first yellow block and the other orange cylinder. A red arch block is placed on top of both the second yellow block and the blue cube, spanning across them.\n        *   **Layer 3:** An orange cylinder is placed vertically on the center of the red arch block.\n        *   **Layer 4:** An orange triangular prism is placed on top of the orange cylinder, pointing upwards.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n    *   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n        *   Orange Cylinder (vertical) x 3: Index 11\n        *   Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal) x 2: Index 8\n        *   Blue Cube x 1: Index 5\n        *   Red Arch Block (orientation as shown in target) x 1: Index 2\n        *   Orange Triangular Prism (pointing upwards) x 1: Index 13\n\n    *   **List of Block Indices:** 11, 11, 8, 8, 5, 2, 11, 13\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n    {\n       Step1: Move block with index 11\n       Step2: Move block with index 11\n       Step3: Move block with index 8\n       Step4: Move block with index 8\n       Step5: Move block with index 5\n       Step6: Move block with index 2\n       Step7: Move block with index 11\n       Step8: Move block with index 13\n    }"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **9 blocks** in total.\n    - The structure has a maximum of **4 layers** in the left part and **2 layers** in the right part.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Left Structure:**\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red arch block is positioned in the front. Two orange cylinder blocks are placed behind the arch, one on each side, creating a base.\n        - **Layer 2:** A green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the arch and the two orange cylinders, bridging across them.\n        - **Layer 3:** A blue cube block is placed centrally on top of the green rectangular block.\n        - **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange roof block is placed on top of the blue cube block.\n    - **Right Structure:**\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two orange cylinder blocks are placed horizontally and side-by-side, forming a base.\n        - **Layer 2 (Top):** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two orange cylinder blocks, across their length.\n    - The left and right structures are positioned separately on the grid, with a visible gap between them.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Red Arch: Index **1**\n    - Orange Cylinder (vertical orientation): Index **8** (used 4 times)\n    - Green Rectangular Block (horizontal orientation): Index **3**\n    - Blue Cube: Index **2**\n    - Orange Roof: Index **16**\n    - Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal orientation): Index **6**\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 1, 8, 8, 3, 2, 16, 8, 8, 6\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 16\n   Step7: Move block with index 8\n   Step8: Move block with index 8\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n}\n```"

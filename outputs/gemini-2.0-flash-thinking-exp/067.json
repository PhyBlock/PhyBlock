Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **6 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom - Red):** 3 blocks\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle - Yellow):** 2 blocks\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top - Orange):** 1 block\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red arch-shaped blocks are positioned on the outer sides, facing inwards. A red rectangular block is placed horizontally in the center, connecting the two arch blocks and forming a base with an opening in the middle.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Two yellow semi-circular blocks are placed on top of the red arch blocks from the layer below. They are positioned such that their curved sides face upwards and outwards, creating a rounded top for the archway.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange triangular prism block is placed centrally on top of the two yellow semi-circular blocks, forming the peak of the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red arch block (for the base - left and right): **Index 1** (Used twice)\n    *   Red rectangular block (for the base - middle): **Index 2** (Used once)\n    *   Yellow semi-circular block (for the middle layer - left and right): **Index 7** (Used twice)\n    *   Orange triangular prism (for the top layer): **Index 15** (Used once)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 2, 7, 7, 15\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All selected block indices correspond to blocks in the dictionary that match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No rotation is needed, and blocks are used as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** Build from the bottom layer upwards for stability and ease of construction.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```"

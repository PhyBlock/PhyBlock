Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **5 blocks** and has **4 layers** if we consider each distinct vertical level as a layer, or 3 layers if we group the bottom cylinders as one layer. Let's consider it 4 layers for step-by-step assembly.\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 orange cylinder blocks.\n    *   Layer 2: 1 yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the layer 1 cylinders.\n    *   Layer 3: 1 orange cylinder block placed vertically on top of the yellow block, towards the back.\n    *   Layer 4 (Top): 1 yellow semi-circular block placed on top of the layer 3 cylinder.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two orange cylinder blocks are positioned side-by-side at the base, forming the first layer and supporting the structure.\n    *   A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally across and on top of these two cylinders, acting as a bridge.\n    *   An orange cylinder block is placed vertically on the rear part of the yellow rectangular block.\n    *   A yellow semi-circular block is placed on top of the vertical orange cylinder.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the base cylinders (Layer 1): We need two orange cylinders oriented vertically. Block index **7** from the dictionary matches this.\n    *   For the horizontal bridge (Layer 2): We need a yellow rectangular block oriented horizontally. Block index **1** from the dictionary matches this.\n    *   For the vertical neck cylinder (Layer 3): We need an orange cylinder oriented vertically. Block index **7** from the dictionary matches this.\n    *   For the head (Layer 4): We need a yellow semi-circular block oriented in a dome-like shape. Block index **10** from the dictionary matches this.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 1, 7, 10\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:**  We will assemble the structure layer by layer, starting from the bottom.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```"

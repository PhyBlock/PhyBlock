Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **14 blocks** in total.\n    - It has **5 layers** at its highest point (the orange triangle on top of the tall cylinder structure).\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Left Structure (Lower, Shorter):**\n        - **Layer 1 (Base):** From left to right, a Blue Cube, a horizontal Yellow Rectangular block, a Red Cube, and a Green Cube are placed side-by-side forming a rectangular base.\n        - **Layer 2 (Top):** A horizontal Yellow Rectangular block is placed on top of the Blue Cube and the left half of the base Yellow Rectangular block. A Red Triangle (pointing upwards and to the right) is placed on top of the Red Cube and the Green Cube.\n    - **Right Structure (Taller):**\n        - **Layer 1 (Base):** Three Orange Cylinders are placed adjacent to each other in a horizontal line.\n        - **Layer 2:** A horizontal Yellow Rectangular block is placed on top of the middle Orange Cylinder and partially overlapping the two adjacent cylinders.\n        - **Layer 3:** A Blue Cube is placed on the left side of the Yellow Rectangular block. A Red Arch is placed on the right side of the Yellow Rectangular block, next to the Blue Cube.\n        - **Layer 4:** An Orange Cylinder is placed on top of the Blue Cube.\n        - **Layer 5 (Top):** An Orange Triangle (pointing upwards and to the right) is placed on top of the Orange Cylinder.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Blue Cube (x2): Index 6\n    - Yellow Rectangular (horizontal) (x2): Index 10\n    - Red Cube (x1): Index 8\n    - Green Cube (x1): Index 7\n    - Red Triangle (pointing right) (x2): Index 14\n    - Orange Cylinder (x4): Index 12\n    - Red Arch (x1): Index 2\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 6, 10, 8, 7, 10, 14, 12, 12, 12, 10, 6, 2, 12, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n    Step12: Move block with index 2\n    Step13: Move block with index 12\n    Step14: Move block with index 14\n }"

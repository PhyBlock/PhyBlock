Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **18 blocks** and has a maximum of **4 layers**.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Base Layer (Layer 1):** Consists of two groups of red arch blocks. The left group has 3 red arches placed side-by-side, and the right group has 2 red arches placed side-by-side, slightly separated from the left group.\n    - **Layer 2 (Left Group):** On top of the leftmost two arches of the left group are two yellow semi-cylinder blocks. On top of the rightmost arch of the left group is a blue cube block. To the right of this blue cube, resting on the base layer and adjacent to the blue cube, is an orange rectangular block (laying flat). Behind the orange block is a green rectangular block (laying flat), and behind the green block is a yellow rectangular block (laying flat).\n    - **Layer 2 (Right Group):** On top of the leftmost arch of the right group is a blue cube block. On top of the rightmost arch of the right group is a green rectangular block (laying flat).\n    - **Layer 3 (Left Group):** Three orange roof blocks are placed on top of the two yellow semi-cylinder blocks and the blue cube block of the left group.\n    - **Layer 3 (Right Group):** One orange roof block is placed on top of the blue cube and green rectangular block of the right group.\n    - **Layer 4 (Left Group):** A yellow tall rectangular block is placed on top of the middle orange roof block of the left group.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Red Arch Base: Block Index **1** (needed 5 times)\n    - Yellow Semi-cylinder: Block Index **12** (needed 2 times)\n    - Blue Cube: Block Index **5** (needed 2 times)\n    - Orange Rectangular Prism (flat): Block Index **15** (needed 1 time)\n    - Green Rectangular Prism (flat): Block Index **8** (needed 2 times)\n    - Yellow Rectangular Prism (flat): Block Index **10** (needed 1 time)\n    - Orange Roof: Block Index **16** (needed 4 times)\n    - Yellow Rectangular Prism (tall): Block Index **11** (needed 1 time)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step15\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step16\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step17\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step18\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```"

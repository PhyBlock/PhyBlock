Considering the maximum height, we can say 4 layers.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:**\n      - The main structure resembles a chair. It has a base of four orange cylinders arranged in a rectangle. Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of these cylinders to form the seat. A green cube is placed on one of the yellow blocks to form the back of the chair, and a yellow half-cylinder is placed on top of the green cube.\n      - Separately, to the left of the chair, there is a smaller structure. It consists of an orange triangular prism placed on its angled side as the base, and a blue cube on top of its flat surface.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n   - **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n      - Orange Cylinder (for chair legs): Block Index 5 (needed 4 times)\n      - Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal, for chair seat): Block Index 4 (needed 2 times)\n      - Green Cube (for chair back): Block Index 2 (needed 1 time)\n      - Yellow Half-Cylinder (for chair back top): Block Index 7 (needed 1 time)\n      - Orange Triangular Prism (angled base, for separate structure): Block Index 13 (needed 1 time)\n      - Blue Cube (for separate structure top): Block Index 1 (needed 1 time)\n\n   - **List of Block Indices:** 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 7, 13, 1\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n   - **Inference of Order & Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7\"\n}\n```"

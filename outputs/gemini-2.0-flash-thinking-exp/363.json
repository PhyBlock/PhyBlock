A red arch block is placed on top of the central orange triangular prism and spans across to the adjacent prisms, creating an arch shape.\n        - Middle: A yellow rectangular prism block is placed horizontally on top of the red arch and the underlying orange triangular prism base.\n        - Top: Two orange cylinder blocks are placed side-by-side, vertically oriented, on top of the yellow rectangular prism.\n    - **Right Sub-structure:**\n        - Base: Two orange triangular prism blocks are placed adjacent to each other.\n        - Middle: A blue rectangular prism block is placed on top of the two orange triangular prism base.\n        - Top: A green rectangular prism block is placed on top of the blue rectangular prism.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Block Indices:**\n    - Orange Triangular Prism (for both structures): Index **13** (appears to match the orientation and shape). We need 5 in total.\n    - Red Arch Block (for left structure): Index **1** (appears to match the orientation and shape). We need 1.\n    - Yellow Rectangular Prism (horizontal, for left structure): Index **7** (appears to match the orientation and shape). We need 1.\n    - Orange Cylinder Block (vertical, for left structure): Index **10** (appears to match the orientation and shape). We need 2.\n    - Blue Rectangular Prism (for right structure): Index **3** (appears to match the orientation and shape). We need 1.\n    - Green Rectangular Prism (horizontal, for right structure): Index **4** (appears to match the orientation and shape). We need 1.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 13, 1, 7, 10, 3, 4.\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 4\"\n}\n```"

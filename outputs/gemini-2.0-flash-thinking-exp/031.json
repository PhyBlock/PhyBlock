Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **4 blocks** and has **2 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of two orange cylinder blocks placed side-by-side horizontally.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Top):**  Has a yellow rectangular prism placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinders, and a blue cube placed on top of the yellow prism.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two orange cylinder blocks form the base, positioned adjacent to each other along their long axis.\n    *   A yellow rectangular prism is placed directly on top of the two orange cylinders, oriented horizontally and spanning across both cylinders.\n    *   A blue cube is positioned on top of the yellow rectangular prism, towards one end, seemingly centered above one of the orange cylinders or a portion of the yellow prism above it.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks & Block Indices:**\n    *   Orange Cylinder (Bottom Layer - Right): **Block 13** (Horizontal Orange Cylinder)\n    *   Orange Cylinder (Bottom Layer - Left): **Block 14** (Horizontal Orange Cylinder)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism (Middle Layer): **Block 6** (Horizontal Yellow Rectangular Prism)\n    *   Blue Cube (Top Layer): **Block 1** (Blue Cube)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 13, 14, 6, 1\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks perfectly match the shapes, colors, and orientations observed in the Main Target Image when compared against the Block Dictionary Image. No rotations are needed, and the blocks are used exactly as presented in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** Based on the structure's layering, the assembly order should start from the bottom layer and proceed upwards.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```"

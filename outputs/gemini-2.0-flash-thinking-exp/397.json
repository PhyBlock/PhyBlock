Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Left Structure:**\n- **Block Count:** 6 blocks\n- **Layers:** 5 layers (considering each distinct vertical level as a layer)\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): Red arch block.\n    - Layer 2: Green horizontal rectangular block, placed centrally on top of the arch.\n    - Layer 3: Yellow horizontal rectangular block, placed centrally on top of the green block.\n    - Layer 4: Orange horizontal rectangular block, placed centrally on top of the yellow block.\n    - Layer 5 (Top): Orange cylinder placed slightly towards the back and orange triangular prism placed slightly towards the front, both on top of the orange rectangular block.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The blocks are stacked vertically, with the base being the red arch. The rectangular blocks are placed centrally on top of each other, and the top layer consists of the cylinder and triangular prism placed side-by-side on the orange rectangle.\n\n**Right Structure:**\n- **Block Count:** 5 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): Yellow horizontal rectangular block, serving as the base.\n    - Layer 2: Green vertical rectangular block placed on one side of the yellow base, and a stack of two square blocks (blue at the bottom, red on top) placed next to the green block on the yellow base.\n    - Layer 3 (Top): Yellow horizontal rectangular block, placed as a cap, covering the green vertical block and the red/blue square block stack, resting on the yellow base block.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is built on a horizontal yellow base. A vertical green block and a stack of red and blue squares are placed side-by-side on this base. The top yellow block acts as a horizontal cap over these elements.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Blocks for Left Structure:**\n- Red arch (Bottom layer): Block index **1**\n- Green rectangular block (Second layer): Block index **6**\n- Yellow rectangular block (Third layer): Block index **10**\n- Orange rectangular block (Fourth layer): Block index **13**\n- Orange cylinder (Top layer): Block index **12**\n- Orange triangular prism (Top layer): Block index **16**\n\n**Blocks for Right Structure:**\n- Yellow rectangular block (horizontal base): Block index **10**\n- Green rectangular block (vertical): Block index **8**\n- Blue square block (bottom of square stack): Block index **4**\n- Red square block (top of square stack): Block index **5**\n- Yellow rectangular block (horizontal top): Block index **10**\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order & Output Instructions:**\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Left Structure:**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index {1}\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index {6}\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index {10}\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index {13}\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index {12}\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index {16}\"\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Right Structure:**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index {10}\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index {8}\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index {4}\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index {5}\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index {10}\"\n}\n```"

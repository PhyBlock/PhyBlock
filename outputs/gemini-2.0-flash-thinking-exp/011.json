Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of a total of 9 blocks.\n    - It is made of 3 distinct layers.\n        - Layer 1 (Bottom Layer): Consists of 4 orange slanted blocks forming a square base.\n        - Layer 2 (Middle Layer): Consists of 4 blue rectangular blocks placed on top of the orange blocks.\n        - Layer 3 (Top Layer): Consists of 1 green square block placed centrally on top of the blue blocks.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - The bottom layer is formed by 4 orange slanted blocks arranged in a square, with the slanted faces pointing outwards and downwards.\n    - The middle layer is built on top of the bottom layer. Each of the 4 blue rectangular blocks is placed on top of two adjacent orange slanted blocks, forming a square arrangement above the first layer.\n    - The top layer is a single green square block positioned in the center, resting on top of the four blue rectangular blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the bottom layer (orange slanted blocks): We need 4 blocks matching the shape and orientation of blocks 11, 12, 13, and 14 from the dictionary.\n        - Block 11: For the front-left slanted orange block.\n        - Block 12: For the front-right slanted orange block.\n        - Block 13: For the back-right slanted orange block.\n        - Block 14: For the back-left slanted orange block.\n    - For the middle layer (blue rectangular blocks): We need 4 blocks matching the shape and orientation of block 6 from the dictionary.\n        - Block 6 (repeated 4 times): For each of the four blue rectangular blocks.\n    - For the top layer (green square block): We need 1 block matching the shape and orientation of block 2 from the dictionary.\n        - Block 2: For the top green square block.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 11, 12, 13, 14, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 6\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n}"

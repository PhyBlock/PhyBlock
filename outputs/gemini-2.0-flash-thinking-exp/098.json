Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **6 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of three blocks: one orange cylinder in the center and two orange triangular prism blocks on either side.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of one red rectangular block with a curved top, placed on top of the cylinder.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of two yellow curved blocks placed side-by-side on top of the red rectangular block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The **orange cylinder** is at the base, standing vertically.\n    *   Two **orange triangular prism blocks** are placed on the ground level, flanking the cylinder on its left and right sides, angled outwards.\n    *   The **red rectangular block with a curved top** is positioned directly on top of the orange cylinder, with its curved part oriented horizontally.\n    *   Two **yellow curved blocks** are placed on the flat top surface of the red rectangular block, side by side. Their curved parts face outwards, creating a symmetrical top layer.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Orange Cylinder (vertical): **Index 8**\n    *   Orange Triangular Prism (right side, angled outward): **Index 14**\n    *   Orange Triangular Prism (left side, angled outward): **Index 15**\n    *   Red Rectangular Block with Curved Top (horizontal curve): **Index 1**\n    *   Yellow Curved Block (horizontal, curve outwards - right side): **Index 10**\n    *   Yellow Curved Block (horizontal, curve outwards - left side): **Index 10**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** Build from the bottom layer upwards. Start with the base cylinder, then add the side triangular prisms, followed by the middle red block, and finally the top yellow blocks.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```"

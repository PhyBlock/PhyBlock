Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **7 blocks** and has **4 layers**.\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 Green blocks\n    - Layer 2: 1 Yellow block\n    - Layer 3: 1 Red block\n    - Layer 4 (Top): 1 Red arch block and 2 Orange roof blocks\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1:** Two green rectangular blocks are placed vertically and side-by-side to form the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two green blocks, spanning across them.\n    - **Layer 3:** A red rectangular block is placed horizontally and centered on top of the yellow block.\n    - **Layer 4:** A red arch block is placed on top of the red rectangular block, centered. Two orange roof blocks are placed on top of the arch block, one on each side, angled to form a roof.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Green vertical block (bottom layer, left): **Index 5**\n    - Green vertical block (bottom layer, right): **Index 5**\n    - Yellow horizontal block (middle layer): **Index 8**\n    - Red horizontal block (middle layer): **Index 1**\n    - Red arch block (top layer): **Index 2**\n    - Orange roof block (top layer, left side): **Index 13**\n    - Orange roof block (top layer, right side): **Index 16**\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 5, 5, 8, 1, 2, 13, 16\n\n- **Matching Criteria:** All selected block indices correspond to blocks in the dictionary that match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No rotations are needed, and blocks are used as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {5}\n    Step2: Move block with index {5}\n    Step3: Move block with index {8}\n    Step4: Move block with index {1}\n    Step5: Move block with index {2}\n    Step6: Move block with index {13}\n    Step7: Move block with index {16}\n}"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of **8 blocks** in total.\n    - The structure has **3 layers**.\n    - Layer 1 (bottom layer): Contains 2 blocks.\n    - Layer 2 (middle layer): Contains 4 blocks.\n    - Layer 3 (top layer): Contains 2 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side, forming the base.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):**\n        - Two green rectangular blocks are placed vertically, standing on top of the outer edges of the yellow blocks from Layer 1. These green blocks are positioned parallel to each other, creating a vertical gap in the center.\n        - In the central gap between the green blocks, two square blocks are placed. A blue square block is at the bottom and a red square block is placed directly on top of the blue block.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of the green blocks from Layer 2, mirroring the arrangement of Layer 1 and capping the structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For Layer 1 (bottom yellow blocks): Block index **11** (Yellow horizontal rectangular block). We need two of these.\n    - For Layer 2 (green vertical blocks): Block index **7** (Green vertical rectangular block). We need two of these.\n    - For Layer 2 (blue square block): Block index **1** (Blue square block). We need one of these.\n    - For Layer 2 (red square block): Block index **3** (Red square block). We need one of these.\n    - For Layer 3 (top yellow blocks): Block index **11** (Yellow horizontal rectangular block). We need two of these.\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 11, 11, 7, 7, 1, 3, 11, 11\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the structure and selected blocks, a possible assembly order is layer by layer, starting from the bottom:\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {11}\n    Step2: Move block with index {11}\n    Step3: Move block with index {7}\n    Step4: Move block with index {7}\n    Step5: Move block with index {1}\n    Step6: Move block with index {3}\n    Step7: Move block with index {11}\n    Step8: Move block with index {11}\n}\n```"

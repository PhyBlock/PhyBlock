Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of two separate substructures.\n    *   **Left Substructure:** Consists of 4 blocks and has 2 layers.\n    *   **Right Substructure:** Consists of 5 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    *   **Total Blocks:** 9 blocks in total across both substructures.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Substructure:**\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side, horizontally oriented.\n        *   **Layer 2 (Top):** A green rectangular block is placed on top of the two red arch blocks, spanning across them. A red arch block is placed on top of the green rectangular block, aligned centrally.\n    *   **Right Substructure:**\n        *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two green rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side, vertically oriented.\n        *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two vertical green rectangular blocks, spanning across them.\n        *   **Layer 3 (Top):** A red arch block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, aligned centrally. An orange triangular block is placed on top of the red arch block, aligned centrally.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch Block (Horizontal orientation): Index **2** (Needed 3 times)\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal orientation): Index **6** (Needed 1 time)\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Vertical orientation): Index **8** (Needed 2 times)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal orientation): Index **11** (Needed 1 time)\n    *   Orange Triangular Block: Index **14** (Needed 1 time)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 11, 2, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

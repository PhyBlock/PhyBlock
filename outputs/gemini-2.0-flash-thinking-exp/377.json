Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Left Structure:**\n- **Count & Layers:** The left structure is composed of 6 blocks and has 4 layers.\n    - Layer 1 (bottom): 1 block (Yellow)\n    - Layer 2: 1 block (Red)\n    - Layer 3: 2 blocks (Green, Yellow)\n    - Layer 4 (top): 2 blocks (Blue, Blue)\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - Layer 1 (Yellow): A horizontal yellow rectangular block forms the base.\n    - Layer 2 (Red): A red semicircular block is placed centrally on top of the yellow block, with the curved part facing upwards.\n    - Layer 3 (Green & Yellow): A horizontal green rectangular block is placed on the left side of the red block, and a small yellow semicircular block is placed on the right side of the red block.\n    - Layer 4 (Blue & Blue): Two blue cubic blocks are placed on top; one on the green block and the other on the yellow block.\n\n**Right Structure:**\n- **Count & Layers:** The right structure is composed of 6 blocks and has 4 layers.\n    - Layer 1 (bottom): 1 block (Orange)\n    - Layer 2: 1 block (Red)\n    - Layer 3: 1 block (Yellow)\n    - Layer 4 (top): 3 blocks (Orange, Orange, Orange)\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - Layer 1 (Orange): A flat orange triangular block forms the base.\n    - Layer 2 (Red): A red semicircular block is placed on top of the orange block, with the curved part facing right.\n    - Layer 3 (Yellow): A yellow semicircular block is placed on top of the red block, with the curved part facing right.\n    - Layer 4 (Orange): Three orange triangular blocks are placed on top of the yellow block to form a roof-like structure. Two are placed side-by-side as the base of the roof and one is placed on top in the middle.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary (For Left Structure):**\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Block Indices:**\n    - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (Layer 1): Index 7\n    - Red semicircular block (Layer 2): Index 1\n    - Green horizontal rectangular block (Layer 3): Index 5\n    - Yellow small semicircular block (Layer 3): Index 9\n    - Blue cubic block (Layer 4): Index 4\n    - Blue cubic block (Layer 4): Index 4\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order (For Left Structure):**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n}"

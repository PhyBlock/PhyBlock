Two orange cylinder blocks are placed vertically on top of the yellow blocks, also side-by-side.\n    - **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two orange cylinders, spanning across them. Two green rectangular blocks are placed vertically, one on each side of the cylinders, resting on the base yellow blocks and supporting the top yellow block.\n    - **Layer 3:** An orange triangular prism block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block in the middle layer, positioned between the two green rectangular blocks.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the base layer (yellow rectangular blocks): We need two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks. **Block index 5** matches this. (x2)\n    - For the base layer (orange cylinder blocks): We need two vertical orange cylinder blocks. **Block index 8** matches this. (x2)\n    - For the middle layer (yellow rectangular block): We need one horizontal yellow rectangular block. **Block index 7** matches this. (x1)\n    - For the middle layer (green rectangular blocks): We need two vertical green rectangular blocks. **Block index 2** matches this. (x2)\n    - For the top layer (orange triangular prism block): We need one orange triangular prism block with the shown orientation. **Block index 16** matches this. (x1)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 5, 5, 8, 8, 7, 2, 2, 16\n\n## Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

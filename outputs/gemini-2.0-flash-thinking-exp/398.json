Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image displays two distinct structures composed of building blocks.\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Structure):**\n- **Block Count:** 3 blocks\n- **Layers:** 1 layer (all blocks are at the same level)\n- **Spatial Relationships:** This structure consists of a central green rectangular block oriented vertically, flanked by two yellow rectangular blocks, also oriented vertically. The yellow blocks are positioned on either side of the green block, creating a U-shaped or framed appearance when viewed from the front.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Structure):**\n- **Block Count:** 7 blocks\n- **Layers:** 4 layers\n- **Spatial Relationships:** This structure is built vertically in layers:\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A green rectangular block oriented vertically serves as the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** An orange cylinder block is placed vertically on top of the green base block.\n    - **Layer 3:** A square frame is constructed around the orange cylinder using four yellow rectangular blocks. These yellow blocks are oriented horizontally to form the square shape.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top):** A blue square block is placed on top of the yellow frame and the orange cylinder.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the main target image, the following blocks are required from the dictionary:\n\n- **For Structure 1 (Left):**\n    - Green vertical rectangular block: **Index 4**\n    - Yellow vertical rectangular block (x2): **Index 7**\n\n- **For Structure 2 (Right):**\n    - Green vertical rectangular base block: **Index 4**\n    - Orange vertical cylinder block: **Index 9**\n    - Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks for frame (x4): **Index 6**\n    - Blue square block: **Index 1**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 9\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the structure and assuming a bottom-up assembly approach, the step-by-step instructions are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```"

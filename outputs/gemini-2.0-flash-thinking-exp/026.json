Two orange cylinders are positioned vertically on top of these yellow blocks, one on the left yellow block and one on the right yellow block.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two orange cylinders, bridging across them. A blue cube is placed on the left side of this yellow block and a red cube is placed on the right side of this yellow block.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Two orange triangular prism blocks are placed on top of the blue and red cubes, forming a roof-like shape. The left triangular prism is on top of the blue cube, and the right triangular prism is on top of the red cube.\n\n## Selection of Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- To construct the target image, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n    - **Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal):** Index 7 (Needed 3 times)\n    - **Orange Cylinder (Vertical):** Index 10 (Needed 2 times)\n    - **Blue Cube:** Index 4 (Needed 1 time)\n    - **Red Cube:** Index 2 (Needed 1 time)\n    - **Orange Triangular Prism:** Index 16 (Needed 2 times)\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 10, 10, 7, 4, 2, 16, 16\n\n## Determined Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

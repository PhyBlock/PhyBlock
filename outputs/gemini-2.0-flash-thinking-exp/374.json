Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **11 blocks** in total.\n    *   It has **4 layers**.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of three red arch blocks placed horizontally. Two are adjacent to each other on the left side, and one is positioned separately to the right.\n    *   **Layer 2:**  On the left side, two yellow half-cylinder blocks are placed on top of the two adjacent red arches. On the right side, a green rectangular prism block is placed on top of the single red arch. Additionally, another green rectangular prism is placed next to the yellow half-cylinders on the left structure, forming part of the second layer across the combined structure.\n    *   **Layer 3:** On the left structure, two yellow rectangular prism blocks are placed on top of the yellow half-cylinders. On the right structure, a blue cube block is placed on top of the green rectangular prism.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange pyramid roof block is placed on top of the blue cube on the right structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch (x3): Index 1\n    *   Yellow Half-cylinder (x2): Index 12\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism (x2): Index 10\n    *   Green Rectangular Prism (x2): Index 6\n    *   Blue Cube (x1): Index 3\n    *   Orange Pyramid Roof (x1): Index 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **11 blocks**.\n    *   It can be visually divided into approximately **3-4 layers** in terms of vertical stacking, but blocks are also placed adjacently on the same base level.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:**  The structure rests on a base layer formed by two orange cylinders placed horizontally side-by-side and two red arches placed horizontally side-by-side, slightly separated.\n    *   **Left Side (Train-like):**\n        *   A yellow semi-cylinder is placed on top of the two orange cylinders.\n        *   A blue cube is placed on top of the yellow semi-cylinder.\n        *   A yellow rectangular prism is placed horizontally behind the yellow semi-cylinder and blue cube, resting on the orange cylinders and extending back.\n    *   **Right Side (Tower-like):**\n        *   A red cylinder is placed on top of the two red arches, centered above them.\n        *   An orange cone is placed on top of the red cylinder.\n        *   A yellow rectangular prism is placed vertically next to the red cylinder and cone, resting on one of the red arches.\n        *   A green rectangular prism is placed vertically behind the yellow rectangular prism, also resting on one of the red arches.\n    *   The left and right structures are positioned somewhat separately but are part of the same overall composition in the image.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch (for base, right side): Block 1\n    *   Red Arch (for base, right side): Block 1\n    *   Blue Cube (top of left side): Block 3\n    *   Green Rectangular Prism (vertical, right side): Block 5\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism (horizontal, back of left side): Block 6\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism (vertical, right side): Block 7\n    *   Red Cylinder (middle of right side): Block 8\n    *   Orange Cylinder (for base, left side): Block 9\n    *   Orange Cylinder (for base, left side): Block 9\n    *   Yellow Semi-Cylinder (middle of left side): Block 10\n    *   Orange Cone (top of right side): Block 16\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

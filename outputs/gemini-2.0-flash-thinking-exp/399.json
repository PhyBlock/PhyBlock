            "text": "## Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:\n\nThe main target image displays two distinct structures made of building blocks.\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Structure):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is taller and composed of 7 blocks arranged in 7 layers.\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): 1 Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation).\n    - Layer 2: 1 Blue rectangular block (horizontal orientation), placed on top of the yellow block.\n    - Layer 3: 1 Red U-shaped block, placed on top of the blue block.\n    - Layer 4: 1 Orange cylindrical block, placed vertically on top of the red U-shaped block.\n    - Layer 5: 1 Red U-shaped block, placed vertically on top of the orange cylinder.\n    - Layer 6: 1 Yellow semi-circular block, placed on the top of the red U-shaped block on the left side.\n    - Layer 7: 1 Yellow semi-circular block, placed on the top of the red U-shaped block on the right side.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is built vertically layer by layer. The base is a yellow rectangle, followed by a blue rectangle. A red U-shape sits on top, followed by a vertical orange cylinder and another vertical red U-shape. Two yellow semi-circular blocks are placed side-by-side on the topmost red U-shape.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Structure):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is wider and composed of 7 blocks arranged in 7 layers (in terms of stacking height, although some blocks are placed side by side).\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): 1 Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation).\n    - Layer 2: 1 Red U-shaped block, placed on top of the yellow block.\n    - Layer 3: 1 Green rectangular block (horizontal orientation), placed on top of the red U-shaped block.\n    - Layer 4: 1 Blue cubic block, placed on the left side on top of the green rectangular block.\n    - Layer 5: 1 Blue cubic block, placed on the right side on top of the green rectangular block, adjacent to the first blue cube.\n    - Layer 6: 1 Orange triangular block (leaning inwards to the left), placed on the right side at the base level, next to the yellow rectangular block.\n    - Layer 7: 1 Orange triangular block (leaning inwards to the right), placed on the left side at the base level, next to the yellow rectangular block.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The structure starts with a yellow rectangular base, followed by a red U-shape and a green rectangle. Two blue cubes are placed side-by-side on top of the green rectangle. Two orange triangular blocks are placed on the ground level beside the base of the structure, one on each side and leaning inwards.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**For Structure 1:**\n- Layer 1: Block index 7 (Yellow horizontal rectangle)\n- Layer 2: Block index 5 (Blue horizontal rectangle)\n- Layer 3: Block index 1 (Red U-shape)\n- Layer 4: Block index 9 (Orange cylinder)\n- Layer 5: Block index 1 (Red U-shape)\n- Layer 6: Block index 11 (Yellow semi-circle)\n- Layer 7: Block index 11 (Yellow semi-circle)\n\n**For Structure 2:**\n- Layer 1: Block index 7 (Yellow horizontal rectangle)\n- Layer 2: Block index 1 (Red U-shape)\n- Layer 3: Block index 6 (Green horizontal rectangle)\n- Layer 4: Block index 3 (Blue cube)\n- Layer 5: Block index 3 (Blue cube)\n- Layer 6: Block index 15 (Orange triangle leaning inwards to the left)\n- Layer 7: Block index 16 (Orange triangle leaning inwards to the right)\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\nFor Structure 1: 7, 5, 1, 9, 1, 11, 11\nFor Structure 2: 7, 1, 6, 3, 3, 15, 16\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 6\n    Step11: Move block with index 3\n    Step12: Move block with index 3\n    Step13: Move block with index 15\n    Step14: Move block with index 16\n}"

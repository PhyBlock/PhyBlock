Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **6 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 blocks\n    *   Layer 2 (Middle): 2 blocks\n    *   Layer 3 (Top): 2 blocks\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Two orange cylindrical blocks are placed horizontally adjacent to each other on the ground level, forming the base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two orange cylinders, acting as a bridge connecting them. A red arch block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, positioned centrally.\n    *   **Layer 3:** An orange cylindrical block is placed vertically on top of the red arch block, in the center. An orange triangular prism (pyramid-like) block is placed on top of the vertical orange cylinder.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n    *   For the base layer (orange cylinders): We need two blocks matching the shape and orientation of block index **8**.\n    *   For the middle layer (yellow rectangular block): We need one block matching the shape and orientation of block index **5**.\n    *   For the middle layer (red arch block): We need one block matching the shape and orientation of block index **2**.\n    *   For the top layer (orange cylinder): We need one block matching the shape and orientation of block index **8**.\n    *   For the top layer (orange pyramid): We need one block matching the shape and orientation of block index **16**.\n\n*   **List Block Indices:** 8, 8, 5, 2, 8, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {8}\n    Step2: Move block with index {8}\n    Step3: Move block with index {5}\n    Step4: Move block with index {2}\n    Step5: Move block with index {8}\n    Step6: Move block with index {16}\n}\n```"

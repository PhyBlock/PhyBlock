The bottom layer consists of 3 blocks, and the top layer has 2 blocks.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   **Bottom Layer:** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally and parallel to each other. A green rectangular block is placed vertically in the center, between the two yellow blocks and appears to be resting on them.\n        *   **Top Layer:** A blue rectangular block and a red rectangular block are placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the vertical green block. They also partially overlap with the yellow blocks of the bottom layer.\n        *   **Colors:** The structure uses yellow, green, blue, and red blocks.\n        *   **Orientations:** The structure uses both horizontal and vertical rectangular blocks.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n    *   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n        *   For the bottom layer, we need two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks. From the dictionary, block index **11** matches this description. We will use it twice.\n        *   For the bottom layer, we need one vertical green rectangular block. From the dictionary, block index **7** matches this description.\n        *   For the top layer, we need one horizontal blue rectangular block. While the dictionary shows horizontal rectangular blocks in green (indices **5** and **6**), we will assume these shapes can represent blocks of different colors and choose based on orientation. Block index **5** (horizontal rectangular shape) will be used to represent the blue block in the target image.\n        *   For the top layer, we need one horizontal red rectangular block. Similarly, using the horizontal rectangular shape from the dictionary, block index **6** (horizontal rectangular shape) will be used to represent the red block in the target image.\n    *   **List Block Indices:** 11, 11, 7, 5, 6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n    *   **Inference of Order:** We will build the structure layer by layer, starting from the bottom.\n        1.  Place the first horizontal yellow block (index 11) as the base on one side.\n        2.  Place the second horizontal yellow block (index 11) as the base on the other side, parallel to the first one.\n        3.  Place the vertical green block (index 7) in the center, standing on the base layer between the two yellow blocks.\n        4.  Place the horizontal blue block (index 5) on top of the green block and partially on one of the yellow blocks.\n        5.  Place the horizontal red block (index 6) next to the blue block, on top of the green block and partially on the other yellow block.\n\n    *   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\"\n}\n```"

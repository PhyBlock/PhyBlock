Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **14 blocks** and appears to have **two main structural layers with a small separate structure**.\n    *   **Main Structure Base Layer:** 6 blocks (3 orange rectangles, 2 yellow squares, 1 red arch)\n    *   **Main Structure Second Layer:** 5 blocks (2 orange triangles, 1 red arch, 1 green square, 1 blue cube)\n    *   **Main Structure Top Layer:** 1 block (1 orange triangle)\n    *   **Small Separate Structure:** 2 blocks (1 red arch, 1 orange triangle)\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Main Structure Base Layer (Left to Right):**  An orange rectangular block, followed by a yellow square block, then a red arch block, another yellow square block, and finally two orange rectangular blocks. All are placed horizontally on the ground plane.\n    *   **Main Structure Second Layer:** An orange triangular block is placed on top of the first orange rectangle and yellow square of the base layer. A red arch block is centered on top of the red arch block from the base layer. Another orange triangular block is placed on top of the second yellow square and the first of the last two orange rectangles of the base layer. A green square block is placed on top of the last orange rectangular block of the base layer. A blue cube block is placed on top of the green square block.\n    *   **Main Structure Top Layer:** An orange triangular block is placed on top of the blue cube block.\n    *   **Small Separate Structure:** A red arch block is placed horizontally on the ground plane, and an orange triangular block is placed on top of the red arch block. This small structure is positioned to the right of the main structure.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Orange Rectangular Block (horizontal orientation): Index **10** (Used 3 times in the main structure base)\n    *   Yellow Square Block: Index **9** (Used 2 times in the main structure base)\n    *   Red Arch Block (horizontal orientation, wider arch): Index **2** (Used 2 times, once in main structure base and once in second layer)\n    *   Orange Triangular Block (right-leaning orientation): Index **14** (Used 4 times, twice in the main structure second layer, once in the main structure top layer and once in the small structure top)\n    *   Green Square Block: Index **8** (Used 1 time in the main structure second layer)\n    *   Blue Cube Block: Index **7** (Used 1 time in the main structure second layer)\n    *   Red Arch Block (horizontal orientation, narrower arch): Index **1** (Used 1 time in the small structure base)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 10, 9, 2, 9, 10, 10, 14, 2, 14, 8, 7, 14, 1, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {10}\n    Step2: Move block with index {9}\n    Step3: Move block with index {2}\n    Step4: Move block with index {9}\n    Step5: Move block with index {10}\n    Step6: Move block with index {10}\n    Step7: Move block with index {14}\n    Step8: Move block with index {2}\n    Step9: Move block with index {14}\n    Step10: Move block with index {8}\n    Step11: Move block with index {7}\n    Step12: Move block with index {14}\n    Step13: Move block with index {1}\n    Step14: Move block with index {14}\n}"

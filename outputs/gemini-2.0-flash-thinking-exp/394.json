Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **14 blocks** in total.\n    *   The structure has **3 layers** at its tallest point (the tower on the right). The car-like structure on the left has 2 layers.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Car-like Structure (Left):**\n        *   Base layer: Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side, forming a base with an arch shape.\n        *   Top layer: Two orange triangle blocks are placed on top of each red arch block, angled inwards to form a roof-like structure.\n    *   **Tower-like Structure (Right):**\n        *   Base layer: Two yellow square blocks are placed side-by-side. A red arch block is placed adjacent to them, forming a line.\n        *   Middle layer: A red arch block is placed on top of the red arch block from the base layer. Two orange triangle blocks are placed on top of the two yellow square blocks from the base layer, angled inwards towards the center.\n        *   Top layer: A blue square block and a green square block are placed side-by-side on top of the red arch block in the middle layer. Two orange triangle blocks are placed on top of the blue and green square blocks, angled inwards to form a roof-like peak.\n    *   The car-like structure is positioned to the left of the tower-like structure, with a small gap between them.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch Block (for car base and tower base & middle): Index **1** (for car base), Index **2** (for tower base & middle)\n    *   Orange Triangle Block (for car roof and tower roof): Index **12** (used multiple times)\n    *   Yellow Square Block (for tower base): Index **8** (used twice)\n    *   Blue Square Block (for tower top): Index **4**\n    *   Green Square Block (for tower top): Index **5**\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 12, 12, 8, 8, 2, 2, 12, 12, 4, 5, 12, 12\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```"

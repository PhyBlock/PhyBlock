Two green cubic blocks are placed side-by-side on top of the yellow block.\n         - **Layer 3:** A blue cubic block is placed centrally on top of the two green cubic blocks.\n         - **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange triangular prism block is placed centrally on top of the blue cubic block.\n      - **Right Structure:**\n         - A red ring block is standing upright.\n         - Two blue cubic blocks are inserted into the opening of the red ring block, positioned opposite to each other within the ring's space.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n   - **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n      - Red Arch Block (for left structure base, x2): Index 1\n      - Yellow Rectangular Block (for left structure layer 2): Index 12\n      - Green Cubic Block (for left structure layer 2, x2): Index 9\n      - Blue Cubic Block (for left structure layer 3 and right structure, x3): Index 8\n      - Orange Triangular Prism Block (for left structure top): Index 13\n      - Red Ring Block (for right structure): Index 5\n\n   - **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 12, 9, 9, 8, 13, 5, 8, 8\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n   - **Inferred Assembly Sequence:** Based on the structure and block selection, a possible assembly order is as follows:\n      ```json\n      {\n         \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n         \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n         \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n         \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n         \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n         \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n         \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n         \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n         \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n         \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 8\"\n      }\n      ```\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n   \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n   \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n   \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n   \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n   \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n   \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n   \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n   \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n   \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 8\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:\n\nThe main target image displays two separate structures built from blocks.\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- **Block Count:** 7 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 Red Arch blocks placed side-by-side horizontally.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 Yellow Rectangular blocks placed horizontally on top of the arch blocks, spanning across both.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 2 Red Arch blocks placed horizontally on top of the yellow blocks, aligned with the base arch blocks, and 1 Red Triangle Roof block placed centrally on top of the two arch blocks, forming a peaked roof.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is built in a layered fashion, with blocks stacked vertically. The yellow rectangular blocks bridge the two arch blocks in the layer below. The top arch blocks are aligned with the base arch blocks, and the triangle roof sits on top.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Block Count:** 5 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 Orange Triangle blocks placed side-by-side with their longer sides touching and angled outwards.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 Green Square blocks stacked vertically on top of the triangle base.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 1 Orange Triangle Roof block placed on top of the green square blocks, forming a peaked roof.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is built vertically. The green square blocks are stacked to form a column on the triangular base. The triangle roof sits on top of the green column.\n\n## 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Red Arch (Bottom Layer - x2): Block Index 2 (Used twice)\n- Yellow Rectangular (Middle Layer - x2): Block Index 10 (Used twice)\n- Red Arch (Top Layer - x2): Block Index 2 (Used twice)\n- Red Triangle Roof (Top Roof - x1): Block Index 1\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Orange Triangle (Bottom Layer - x2): Block Index 13 (Used twice)\n- Green Square (Middle Layer - x2): Block Index 7 (Used twice)\n- Orange Triangle Roof (Top Roof - x1): Block Index 16\n\n**List of Block Indices (in assembly order):** 2, 2, 10, 10, 2, 2, 1, 13, 13, 7, 7, 16\n\n## 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

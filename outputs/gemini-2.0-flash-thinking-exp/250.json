Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Left Structure Analysis:**\n- **Count & Layers:** The left structure is composed of 8 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 blocks\n    - Layer 2 (Middle): 2 blocks\n    - Layer 3 (Top): 4 blocks\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - Layer 1: Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally adjacent to each other on the ground level.\n    - Layer 2: Two orange cylindrical blocks are placed on top of the yellow rectangular blocks. Each cylinder is positioned centrally over one yellow block.\n    - Layer 3: On the right cylindrical block, a yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally. On the left cylindrical block, a blue cube is placed. A red cube is placed on top of the blue cube. An orange triangular roof block is placed on top of both the red and blue cubes, and also partially over the yellow rectangular block to the right, forming a roof-like shape.\n\n**Right Structure Analysis:**\n- **Count & Layers:** The right structure is composed of 6 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 blocks\n    - Layer 2 (Middle): 2 blocks\n    - Layer 3 (Top): 2 blocks\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - Layer 1: Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally adjacent to each other on the ground level, similar to the left structure.\n    - Layer 2: Two green cube blocks are placed on top of the yellow rectangular blocks, adjacent to each other.\n    - Layer 3: A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the left green cube block. A red arch block is placed on top, spanning across both green cube blocks and partially over the yellow rectangular block on the left.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Blocks for Left Structure:**\n- Layer 1 (Yellow Rectangular): Block Index 9 (Used twice)\n- Layer 2 (Orange Cylinder): Block Index 11 (Used twice)\n- Layer 3 (Yellow Rectangular): Block Index 9\n- Layer 3 (Blue Cube): Block Index 6\n- Layer 3 (Red Cube): Block Index 5\n- Layer 3 (Orange Triangular Roof): Block Index 14\n\n**Blocks for Right Structure:**\n- Layer 1 (Yellow Rectangular): Block Index 9 (Used twice)\n- Layer 2 (Green Cube): Block Index 4 (Used twice)\n- Layer 3 (Yellow Rectangular): Block Index 9\n- Layer 3 (Red Arch): Block Index 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 5\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 4\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n    Step14: Move block with index 1\n }"

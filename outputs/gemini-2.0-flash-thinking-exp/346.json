Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 4 blocks and has 2 layers.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 2 orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically and placed side-by-side.\n    - **Layer 2 (Top):**  Has a yellow rectangular block placed horizontally across the top of the two cylinders. On top of this yellow block, there is an orange triangular prism, oriented with its slanted side facing downwards to the right.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The two cylindrical blocks are adjacent on the base layer. The rectangular block is placed horizontally, spanning across and resting on both cylinders. The triangular prism is positioned on top of the rectangular block, slightly offset to the right side of the structure.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is made of 6 blocks and has 4 layers.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red curved block forms the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** A green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the curved red block.\n    - **Layer 3:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the green rectangular block.\n    - **Layer 4:** Two orange triangular prisms are placed side-by-side on top of the yellow rectangular block, forming a roof shape.\n    - **Layer 5 (Top):** An orange cylindrical block is placed vertically on top of the two triangular prisms, in the center of the roof.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The blocks are stacked vertically, one on top of another, starting with the curved red block at the base. The two triangular prisms are placed adjacent to each other on the yellow rectangular block to create a roof shape. The cylindrical block is positioned centrally on top of this roof structure.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**For Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Orange Cylinder (Vertical): Block index **8** (Used twice)\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index **7**\n- Orange Triangular Prism (Slanted right down): Block index **16**\n\n**For Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Red Curved Block: Block index **1**\n- Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index **4**\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index **7**\n- Orange Triangular Prism (Slanted left down): Block index **15**\n- Orange Triangular Prism (Slanted right down): Block index **16**\n- Orange Cylinder (Vertical): Block index **8**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 1 (Left):**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly Instructions for Structure 2 (Right):**\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\"\n}\n```"

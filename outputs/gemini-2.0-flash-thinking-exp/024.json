Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **9 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 3 blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 3 blocks stacked on top of Layer 1.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 3 blocks placed on top of Layer 2, forming the roof.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Three blocks are arranged horizontally in a row. From left to right, they are Orange, Green, and Orange.\n    *   **Layer 2:**  This layer is directly above Layer 1.  It also has three blocks arranged horizontally. From left to right, they are Green, Blue, and Blue. The Green block is positioned above the Orange block on the left of Layer 1. The first Blue block is above the Green block in the center of Layer 1. The second Blue block is above the Orange block on the right of Layer 1.\n    *   **Layer 3:** This layer is on top of Layer 2. It has three blocks. From left to right, they are an Orange Triangle (slanted right), a Blue Cube, and an Orange Triangle (slanted left). The Orange Triangle (slanted right) is positioned above the Green block on the left of Layer 2. The Blue Cube is positioned above the first Blue block in the center of Layer 2. The Orange Triangle (slanted left) is positioned above the second Blue block on the right of Layer 2.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For Layer 1 (Orange, Green, Orange): We need Block 3 (Orange Cube), Block 2 (Green Cube), Block 3 (Orange Cube).\n    *   For Layer 2 (Green, Blue, Blue): We need Block 2 (Green Cube), Block 1 (Blue Cube), Block 1 (Blue Cube).\n    *   For Layer 3 (Orange Triangle (right), Blue Cube, Orange Triangle (left)): We need Block 15 (Orange Triangle slanted right), Block 1 (Blue Cube), Block 16 (Orange Triangle slanted left).\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 15, 1, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```"

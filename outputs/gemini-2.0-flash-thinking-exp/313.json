Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   **Giraffe Structure (Left):**  Consists of 7 blocks and has 3 layers.\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 3 orange cylinder blocks.\n        *   Layer 2 (Middle): 2 yellow rectangular blocks.\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): 1 green rectangular block, 1 yellow semi-cylinder block.\n    *   **Dog Structure (Right):** Consists of 7 blocks and has 3 layers.\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 1 orange cylinder block.\n        *   Layer 2 (Middle): 1 green rectangular block, 1 blue cube block, 1 yellow cube block, 1 red cube block (all placed next to each other on top of the cylinder).\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): 2 yellow semi-cylinder blocks (placed on top of the red cube block).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Giraffe Structure:**\n        *   Three orange cylinders form the base, arranged in a triangular or linear fashion to support the upper layers.\n        *   Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the orange cylinders, forming a platform.\n        *   A green rectangular block is placed vertically in the center of the yellow platform.\n        *   A yellow semi-cylinder is placed on top of the green rectangular block.\n    *   **Dog Structure:**\n        *   One orange cylinder acts as the base.\n        *   A green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinder.\n        *   A blue cube, a yellow cube, and a red cube are placed in a row on top of the green rectangular block.\n        *   Two yellow semi-cylinders are placed side-by-side on top of the red cube block.\n    *   **Orange Triangle Block:** There is an orange triangle block placed on the ground near the dog structure, but it does not seem to be part of either the giraffe or dog structure. It is likely just placed there for visual context in the scene. For the purpose of building the structures depicted, we will focus on the connected blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices for Giraffe Structure:**\n    *   Orange Cylinder (tall): Index 11 (x3)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular (long and flat): Index 9 (x2)\n    *   Green Rectangular (tall and thin): Index 8 (x1)\n    *   Yellow Semi-cylinder (dome-shaped): Index 12 (x1)\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices for Dog Structure:**\n    *   Orange Cylinder (tall): Index 11 (x1)\n    *   Green Rectangular (flat and long): Index 6 (x1)\n    *   Blue Cube: Index 3 (x1)\n    *   Yellow Cube: Index 5 (x1)\n    *   Red Cube: Index 4 (x1)\n    *   Yellow Semi-cylinder (dome-shaped): Index 12 (x2)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Assembly Instructions for Giraffe Structure:**\n    ```json\n    {\n       \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n       \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n       \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n       \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n       \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n       \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n       \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   **Assembly Instructions for Dog Structure:**\n    ```json\n    {\n       \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n       \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n       \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n       \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n       \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n       \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n       \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n    }\n    ```"

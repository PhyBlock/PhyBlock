Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **9 blocks** and has **5 layers**.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side, forming the base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed on top of the red arches in layer 1, also side-by-side.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A green rectangular block and a blue cube are placed on top of the yellow blocks in layer 2, side-by-side. The green block is on the left, and the blue cube is on the right.\n    *   **Layer 4:** Two red arch blocks are placed on top of the green and blue blocks in layer 3, side-by-side, and oriented in the same direction as the arches in layer 1.\n    *   **Layer 5 (Top):** An orange triangular roof block is placed on top of the red arches in layer 4, centered above them.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the base layer (red arches): Block index **1** (used twice).\n    *   For the second layer (yellow rectangles): Block index **10** (used twice).\n    *   For the third layer (green rectangle): Block index **8**.\n    *   For the third layer (blue cube): Block index **7**.\n    *   For the fourth layer (red arches): Block index **1** (used twice).\n    *   For the top layer (orange roof): Block index **13**.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 10, 10, 8, 7, 1, 1, 13\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary precisely match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No rotations are needed, and blocks are used as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** The assembly order is inferred to be layer by layer, starting from the bottom and moving upwards.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n}\n```"

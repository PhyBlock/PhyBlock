Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of two distinct parts.\n    *   **Left Structure:** Consists of 8 blocks and 3 layers.\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 orange cylinder blocks.\n        *   Layer 2 (Middle): 2 yellow rectangular blocks.\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): 4 orange cylinder blocks.\n    *   **Right Structure:** Consists of 5 blocks and 3 layers.\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 red arch blocks.\n        *   Layer 2 (Middle): 1 yellow rectangular block.\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): 1 red arch block and 1 red triangle block.\n    *   **Total Blocks in both structures:** 13 blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   Layer 1: Two orange cylinder blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side on the ground.\n        *   Layer 2: Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the orange cylinders, oriented perpendicular to the cylinders.\n        *   Layer 3: Four orange cylinder blocks are placed vertically on top of the yellow rectangular blocks, with two cylinders on each yellow block.\n    *   **Right Structure:**\n        *   Layer 1: Two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side on the ground, with their arched openings facing each other.\n        *   Layer 2: One yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two red arch blocks, spanning across both.\n        *   Layer 3: One red arch block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, centered, and oriented in the same direction as the bottom arch blocks. A red triangle block is placed on top of this arch block, forming a pointed roof.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For Left Structure:\n        *   Orange Cylinder (Vertical): Block index **7** (Needed 6 times)\n        *   Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index **5** (Needed 2 times)\n    *   For Right Structure:\n        *   Red Arch Block (Arches Inwards): Block index **1** (Needed 3 times)\n        *   Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index **5** (Needed 1 time)\n        *   Red Triangle Block: Block index **11** (Needed 1 time)\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 11\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n    Step12: Move block with index 1\n    Step13: Move block with index 11\n}\n```"

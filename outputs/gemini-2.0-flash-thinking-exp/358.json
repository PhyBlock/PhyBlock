Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image displays two distinct structures composed of building blocks.\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n    *   **Count & Layers:** This structure is made of 3 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): A red arch block forms the base.\n        *   Layer 2 (Middle): A yellow cube is placed directly on top of the red arch block, centered on its upper surface.\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): A blue cube is positioned on top of the yellow cube, also centered.\n\n*   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n    *   **Count & Layers:** This structure is made of 5 blocks and can be considered to have 3 layers if we count the cylinders as the base layer, followed by the green and orange blocks.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Two orange cylinder blocks are placed side-by-side, forming the base.\n        *   Layer 2 (Middle): An orange sloping block is placed on top of the right cylinder. A green rectangular block is placed on top of the left cylinder and partially rests on the sloping block.\n        *   Layer 3 (Top): A thin orange angled block is placed on top of the green rectangular block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Left):**\n    *   Red arch block: Index 1\n    *   Yellow cube block: Index 7\n    *   Blue cube block: Index 4\n\n*   **Structure 2 (Right):**\n    *   Orange cylinder block (x2): Index 12\n    *   Orange sloping block: Index 16\n    *   Green rectangular block: Index 8\n    *   Orange thin angled block: Index 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 16\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n}"

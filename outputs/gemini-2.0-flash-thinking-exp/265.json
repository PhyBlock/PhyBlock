The blue cube block is placed adjacent to one of the semi-cylinder blocks and slightly behind them, forming a base layer.\n    - Layer 2: The yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two yellow semi-cylinder blocks, spanning across them. The red U-shaped block is placed on top of the blue cube block and positioned next to the yellow rectangular block.\n    - Layer 3: The green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the yellow rectangular block and the red U-shaped block. The orange triangular roof block is placed on top of the red U-shaped block and green rectangular block, capping the structure.\n\n**Right Structure:**\n- **Block Count:** 5 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3 layers\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): Consists of one orange rectangular block and one blue cube block.\n    - Layer 2: Consists of one red U-shaped block and one green rectangular block.\n    - Layer 3 (Top): Consists of one orange triangular roof block.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - Layer 1: The orange rectangular block and the blue cube block are placed side-by-side horizontally.\n    - Layer 2: The red U-shaped block is placed on top of the orange rectangular block. The green rectangular block is placed on top of the blue cube block and positioned next to the red U-shaped block.\n    - Layer 3: The orange triangular roof block is placed on top of both the red U-shaped block and the green rectangular block, capping the structure.\n\n2. **Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**For Left Structure:**\n- Yellow semi-cylinder (x2): Block index 11\n- Blue cube (x1): Block index 3\n- Yellow rectangular block (x1): Block index 9\n- Red U-shaped block (x1): Block index 1\n- Green rectangular block (x1): Block index 6\n- Orange triangle roof (x1): Block index 14\n\n**For Right Structure:**\n- Orange rectangular block (x1): Block index 5\n- Blue cube (x1): Block index 3\n- Red U-shaped block (x1): Block index 1\n- Green rectangular block (x1): Block index 6\n- Orange triangle roof (x1): Block index 14\n\n3. **Determination of the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```"

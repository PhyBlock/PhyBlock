Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image displays two distinct structures built from blocks: a tower on the left and a car on the right.\n\n**Tower Structure (Left):**\n- **Block Count:** 6 blocks\n- **Layers:** 4 layers\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A horizontal green rectangular block forms the base.\n    - **Layer 2:** A vertical orange cylinder is placed on top of the green base.\n    - **Layer 3:** A horizontal yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the orange cylinder.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top):** A vertical green rectangular block is placed on top of the yellow block, and a horizontal yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the vertical green block. An orange triangular prism is positioned inside the vertical green rectangular block.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The blocks are stacked vertically, with the green base supporting the orange cylinder, which in turn supports the yellow rectangular block, and so on. The triangular prism is nested within the green rectangular block.\n\n**Car Structure (Right):**\n- **Block Count:** 5 blocks\n- **Layers:** 2 layers\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two horizontal orange cylinders are placed side-by-side, acting as wheels.\n    - **Layer 2 (Top):** A horizontal yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the two orange cylinders, and a blue cube is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The yellow rectangular block rests on the two orange cylinders, and the blue cube is positioned centrally on the yellow block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Blocks for Tower Structure:**\n- Green base (horizontal rectangular): Block index **3**\n- Orange cylinder (vertical): Block index **9**\n- Yellow rectangular (horizontal): Block index **7**\n- Green rectangular (vertical): Block index **5**\n- Yellow rectangular (horizontal) (top): Block index **7**\n- Orange triangular prism: Block index **15**\n\n**Blocks for Car Structure:**\n- Orange cylinder (horizontal) (wheel 1): Block index **10**\n- Orange cylinder (horizontal) (wheel 2): Block index **10**\n- Yellow rectangular (horizontal): Block index **7**\n- Blue cube: Block index **1**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 3, 9, 7, 5, 7, 15, 10, 10, 7, 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n}"

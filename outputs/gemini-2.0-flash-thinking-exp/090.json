Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 8 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** 4 orange cylindrical blocks.\n    * **Layer 2 (Middle):** 2 yellow rectangular blocks.\n    * **Layer 3 (Top):** 1 green rectangular block and 1 yellow semi-cylindrical block.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The four orange cylindrical blocks form the base, arranged in a rectangular pattern.\n    * Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed side-by-side on top of the orange cylinders, creating a platform.\n    * A green rectangular block is placed vertically on the back half of the yellow platform.\n    * A yellow semi-cylindrical block is placed horizontally on top of the green rectangular block, oriented with the curved part facing forward.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    * For the 4 orange cylindrical blocks at the base: Block index **10** (used 4 times).\n    * For the 2 yellow rectangular blocks in the middle layer: Block index **5** (used 2 times).\n    * For the green rectangular block in the top layer: Block index **2**.\n    * For the yellow semi-cylindrical block in the top layer: Block index **12**.\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 10, 10, 10, 10, 5, 5, 2, 12.\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary perfectly match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image without any rotation.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the structure and selected blocks, the assembly order is inferred as follows, starting from the bottom layer and moving upwards:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n }"

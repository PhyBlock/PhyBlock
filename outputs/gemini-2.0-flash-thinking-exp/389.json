A fourth orange wedge block is placed behind the central arch block, seemingly for support.\n    - **Middle Layer:** A blue cube is placed on the left side of the base layer, and a green cube is placed on the right side of the base layer. They are positioned side-by-side on top of the arch and the support wedge.\n    - **Top Layer:** Two orange wedge blocks are placed on top of the blue and green cubes, angled towards each other to form a roof shape.\n\n## Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - For the arch base (Layer 1): We need three orange wedge blocks with the curved side facing upwards. Blocks **13**, **14**, and **15** from the dictionary appear suitable for the arch. Let's use them in that order from left to right in the arch. For the back support of the base, we can use another orange wedge, block **16**.\n    - For the middle layer: We need a blue cube and a green cube. Blocks **6** (blue cube) and **7** (green cube) are perfect.\n    - For the roof (Layer 3): We need two orange wedge blocks angled to form a roof. Blocks **16** and **13** seem appropriate, with block **16** on the right and block **13** on the left side of the roof.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 13, 14, 15, 16, 6, 7, 16, 13\n\n## Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

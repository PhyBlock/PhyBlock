Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **8 blocks** and has **4 layers**.\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** 4 orange cylinder blocks, serving as legs.\n    - **Layer 2:** 2 yellow rectangular blocks, placed horizontally side-by-side on top of the cylinders, forming the body.\n    - **Layer 3:** 1 orange cylinder block, placed vertically in the center of the body, forming the neck.\n    - **Layer 4 (Top):** 1 yellow curved block, placed on top of the neck, forming the head.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - The four orange cylinder blocks are arranged in a rectangular pattern to form the base, acting as legs.\n    - Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally and adjacent to each other on top of the orange cylinders, creating a flat body.\n    - A single orange cylinder is placed vertically on the center of the yellow rectangular blocks, acting as a neck extending upwards.\n    - A yellow curved block is placed on top of the vertical orange cylinder, forming the head of the structure, oriented to curve upwards and slightly forward.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n- **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n    - For the **legs** (bottom layer): We need 4 vertical orange cylinders. Block index **7** in the dictionary matches this description.\n    - For the **body** (middle layer): We need 2 horizontal yellow rectangular blocks. Block index **1** in the dictionary matches this description.\n    - For the **neck** (layer 3): We need 1 vertical orange cylinder, same as the legs. Block index **7** again.\n    - For the **head** (top layer): We need 1 yellow curved block oriented upwards. Block index **10** in the dictionary matches this description.\n\n- **List of Block Indices:** 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 1, 7, 10\n\n- **Matching Criteria:** All selected block indices correspond to blocks in the dictionary that exactly match the shape, color, and required rotational orientation as seen in the main target image. No block rotation is needed or performed.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n- **Inference of Order:** Based on the layer structure, the assembly order should be from bottom to top.\n\n- **Output Format:**\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n}\n```"

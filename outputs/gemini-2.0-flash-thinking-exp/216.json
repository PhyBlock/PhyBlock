Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure on the left in the main target image is composed of **5 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of two red arch blocks placed side-by-side, forming a base with the arches facing each other inwards.\n    * **Layer 2 (Middle):** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the two red arch blocks, bridging across them.\n    * **Layer 3 (Top):** Two orange roof blocks are placed on top of the yellow block. One roof block is oriented with its slope to the right, and the other is oriented with its slope to the left, forming a peaked roof shape.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n    * For the bottom layer (red arch blocks): Block index **2** (used twice).\n    * For the middle layer (yellow rectangular block): Block index **12**.\n    * For the top layer (orange roof blocks): Block index **15** and **16**.\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 12, 15, 16\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image.\n    * Red arch blocks (index 2) match the red arched base.\n    * Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 12) matches the yellow middle layer.\n    * Orange roof blocks (index 15 and 16) match the orange roof shape.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index {2}\n    Step2: Move block with index {2}\n    Step3: Move block with index {12}\n    Step4: Move block with index {15}\n    Step5: Move block with index {16}\n}"

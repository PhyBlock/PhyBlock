The left ramp slopes down to the left, and the right ramp slopes down to the right.\n    *   The second layer is placed on top of the arch and ramp blocks.\n    *   A **green rectangular block** is placed directly on top of the red arch block, spanning across the top of the arch.\n    *   An **orange triangular block** is placed on top of the green rectangular block, towards the back of the structure (in the image perspective). The triangular block's pointed edge is facing upwards and slightly backwards.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch Block (Bottom Layer, Center): **Index 1**\n    *   Orange Ramp Block (Bottom Layer, Left): **Index 12**\n    *   Orange Ramp Block (Bottom Layer, Right): **Index 14**\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Top Layer, Base): **Index 5**\n    *   Orange Triangular Block (Top Layer, Top): **Index 9**\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary perfectly match the shape, color, and rotational orientation of the blocks in the main target image. No rotations are needed or applied.\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the structure and the selected blocks, the assembly order should be from bottom to top, layer by layer:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\"\n}\n```"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **5 blocks** and has **3 layers**.\n    * **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of two blocks placed side-by-side.\n    * **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of two blocks placed vertically on top of the first layer, forming walls.\n    * **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of one block placed horizontally on top of the second layer, acting as a cover, and one red block placed inside the structure.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Layer 1:** A horizontally oriented green rectangular block is placed adjacent to a horizontally oriented yellow rectangular block.\n    * **Layer 2:** A vertically oriented green rectangular block is placed on top of the horizontal green block from Layer 1. Similarly, a vertically oriented yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the horizontal yellow block from Layer 1. These vertical blocks are positioned to form the side walls of the structure.\n    * **Layer 3:** A horizontally oriented green rectangular block is placed on top of the vertical green and yellow blocks from Layer 2, effectively closing the top of the structure. A red cube is placed inside the structure, sitting on the first layer and enclosed by the walls of the second layer and the top of the third layer.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    * For the bottom layer (horizontal green): Block index **6**\n    * For the bottom layer (horizontal yellow): Block index **11**\n    * For the middle layer wall (vertical green): Block index **9**\n    * For the middle layer wall (vertical yellow): Block index **13**\n    * For the top layer (horizontal green): Block index **6**\n    * For the inner block (red cube): Block index **4**\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 6, 11, 9, 13, 6, 4\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All selected blocks from the dictionary perfectly match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks observed in the main target image. No rotations are needed, and the blocks are used as they appear in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index {6}\n   Step2: Move block with index {11}\n   Step3: Move block with index {9}\n   Step4: Move block with index {13}\n   Step5: Move block with index {6}\n   Step6: Move block with index {4}\n}"

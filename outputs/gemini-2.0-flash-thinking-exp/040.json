Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of 4 blocks and has 3 layers.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of 1 red block.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** Consists of 2 blocks - a green block and a blue block, placed side-by-side.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Consists of 1 red block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer has a red block with a curved top surface.\n    *   The middle layer is placed on top of the bottom red block. It consists of a green cube positioned next to a blue cube. From the given perspective, the green cube appears slightly in front of the blue cube.\n    *   The top layer is placed on top of the middle layer. It consists of a red block with a curved bottom surface, oriented to fit on top of the green and blue cubes and align with the bottom red block.\n    *   The red blocks in the top and bottom layers are aligned vertically.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the bottom red block with a curved top: **Index 5**\n    *   For the green cube: **Index 10**\n    *   For the blue cube: **Index 9**\n    *   For the top red block with a curved bottom: **Index 2**\n\n*   **List Block Indices:** 5, 10, 9, 2\n\n*   **Matching Criteria:**\n    *   Block 5 from the dictionary perfectly matches the shape, color (red), and orientation of the bottom red block in the target image.\n    *   Block 10 from the dictionary perfectly matches the shape (cube), color (green), and orientation of the green block in the target image.\n    *   Block 9 from the dictionary perfectly matches the shape (cube), color (blue), and orientation of the blue block in the target image.\n    *   Block 2 from the dictionary perfectly matches the shape, color (red), and orientation of the top red block in the target image.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** To build the structure, we should start from the bottom layer and move upwards.\n    1.  Place the bottom red block.\n    2.  Place the green cube on top of the red block.\n    3.  Place the blue cube next to the green cube on top of the red block.\n    4.  Place the top red block on top of the green and blue cubes.\n\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n}\n```"

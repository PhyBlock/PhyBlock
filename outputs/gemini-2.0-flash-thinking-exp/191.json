Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:**\n    - The structure is composed of two separate sub-structures.\n    - **Left Sub-structure (Tower):** Consists of 5 blocks and 4 layers.\n    - **Right Sub-structure (Car-like):** Consists of 5 blocks and 3 layers.\n    - **Total Blocks:** 10 blocks in total across both sub-structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Left Sub-structure (Tower):**\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red arch block is at the base.\n        - **Layer 2:** A green rectangular block is placed directly on top of the red arch.\n        - **Layer 3:** A blue cube block is placed on top of the green rectangular block.\n        - **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange roof block is placed on top of the blue cube block.\n        - To the right of the tower, standing on the ground level, is an orange cylinder block oriented vertically.\n\n    * **Right Sub-structure (Car-like):**\n        - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two orange cylinder blocks are placed horizontally, parallel to each other, acting as wheels/base.\n        - **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of both orange cylinder blocks, spanning across them.\n        - **Layer 3:** A blue cube block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block, towards one end.\n        - **Layer 4 (Top):** An orange roof block is placed on top of the blue cube block.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    - Red Arch (Tower Base): Index **1**\n    - Green Rectangle (Tower Middle): Index **5**\n    - Blue Cube (Tower Middle & Car Top): Index **3** (Used twice)\n    - Orange Roof (Tower Top & Car Top): Index **13** (Used twice)\n    - Orange Cylinder Vertical (Next to Tower): Index **9**\n    - Orange Cylinder Horizontal (Car Base): Index **10** (Used twice)\n    - Yellow Rectangle Horizontal (Car Middle): Index **7**\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 5, 3, 13, 9, 10, 10, 7, 3, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n* **Assembly Sequence:**\n    {\n        Step1: Move block with index 1\n        Step2: Move block with index 5\n        Step3: Move block with index 3\n        Step4: Move block with index 13\n        Step5: Move block with index 9\n        Step6: Move block with index 10\n        Step7: Move block with index 10\n        Step8: Move block with index 7\n        Step9: Move block with index 3\n        Step10: Move block with index 13\n     }"

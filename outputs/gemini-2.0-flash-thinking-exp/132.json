Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of **5 blocks** and has **2 layers**.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer):** Consists of 2 red arch-shaped blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Top Layer):** Consists of 3 green rectangular blocks standing vertically.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   In the bottom layer, two red arch blocks are placed side-by-side, horizontally adjacent to each other. The arches are oriented upwards.\n    *   In the top layer, three green rectangular blocks are placed on top of the red blocks in the layer below. They are also horizontally adjacent, forming a short wall on top of the red blocks.  The central green block appears to be positioned directly above the seam between the two red blocks below.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   For the **red arch blocks** in the bottom layer, block index **1** from the dictionary matches perfectly in shape, color, and orientation. We need two of these.\n    *   For the **green rectangular blocks** in the top layer, block index **11** from the dictionary matches perfectly in shape, color, and orientation (vertical). We need three of these.\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 11, 11, 11\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inferred Assembly Sequence:** Based on the structure, a logical assembly order would be to first place the two red arch blocks side-by-side to form the base layer, and then place the three green rectangular blocks on top to form the upper layer.\n\n*   **Output Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```"

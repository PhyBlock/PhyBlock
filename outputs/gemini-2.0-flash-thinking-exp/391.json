To its right is a green rectangular block, and further to the right is a blue cube.\n        *   **Layer 3:** A red rectangular block is placed on top of the orange rectangular block. A yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the green rectangular block. A yellow semi-cylinder is placed on top, spanning across the blue cube, yellow rectangular block, and partially over the red and orange rectangular blocks.\n\n*   **Carriage Part:**\n    *   **Layers:** 3 layers are visible above the base.\n    *   **Block Count:** 6 blocks are used in the carriage part.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Two red arches are placed side-by-side as the base.\n        *   **Layer 2:** A red arch is placed centrally on top of the base arches. A yellow rectangular block is placed next to this central arch, on top of the base arches.\n        *   **Layer 3:** Another red arch is placed on top of the central arch from layer 2. Another yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the yellow rectangular block from layer 2.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n*   **Engine Part:**\n    *   Orange Cylinders (wheels): Block index **14** (x2)\n    *   Orange Rectangular Block (horizontal): Block index **11**\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (horizontal): Block index **8**\n    *   Blue Cube: Block index **5**\n    *   Red Rectangular Block (horizontal): Block index **7** (Assuming the red cube in dictionary represents a rectangular block in this orientation, based on visual similarity in perspective and color).\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal): Block index **10**\n    *   Yellow Semi-cylinder (horizontal): Block index **15**\n\n*   **Carriage Part:**\n    *   Red Arches (bottom layer): Block index **1** (x2)\n    *   Red Arches (middle and top layers): Block index **2** (x2)\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Blocks (horizontal): Block index **10** (x2)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 14, 14, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10, 15, 1, 1, 2, 10, 2, 10\n\n## Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```"

The yellow rectangular block is positioned horizontally across and on top of both cylinders. The red triangular prism is placed centrally on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Count:** 6 blocks\n- **Layers:** 3\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): Consists of 1 red cube block as the base.\n    - Layer 2 (Middle): Consists of 2 yellow rectangular blocks placed vertically side-by-side on top of the red cube.\n    - Layer 3 (Top): Consists of 2 green rectangular blocks placed vertically side-by-side on top of the yellow blocks, and 1 green rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the two vertical green blocks, connecting them.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** The red cube is at the base. Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed vertically and adjacently on top of the cube. Two green rectangular blocks are placed vertically and adjacently on top of the yellow blocks. A green rectangular block is placed horizontally across the top of the two vertical green blocks, creating a bridge-like structure.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**For Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Orange Cylinder (Vertical): Block index **9** (Needed twice)\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index **6**\n- Red Triangular Prism (Upright): Block index **12**\n\n**For Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Red Cube: Block index **2**\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (Vertical): Block index **7** (Needed twice)\n- Green Rectangular Block (Vertical): Block index **5** (Needed twice)\n- Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index **4**\n\n## Determine the Assembly Order:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 5\n    Step10: Move block with index 4\n }"

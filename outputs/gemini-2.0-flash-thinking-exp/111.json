The bottom layer consists of two red blocks, and the top layer has one blue block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer is formed by two identical red blocks placed side-by-side horizontally. They are oriented such that their curved parts are facing downwards and outwards.\n    *   The blue block is positioned on top of the two red blocks, centered above their combined structure. It rests on the flat, upper surfaces of both red blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:** Based on the target image analysis, we need:\n    *   Two identical red blocks with a semi-circular shape, oriented horizontally with the curve facing downwards.\n    *   One blue cube.\n*   **List Block Indices:**\n    *   For the red semi-circular block, looking at the Block Dictionary, block index **1** matches the shape, color, and orientation required for the bottom layer.\n    *   For the blue cube, block index **9** in the Block Dictionary is a perfect match.\n*   **Matching Criteria:** The selected blocks from the dictionary precisely match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the main target image. We are using block index 1 twice for the two identical red blocks and block index 9 for the blue cube.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n*   **Inference of Order:** The assembly order should start from the bottom layer and proceed upwards. First, place the two red blocks side by side to form the base, and then place the blue cube on top.\n*   **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 1\n  Step3: Move block with index 9\n}\n```"

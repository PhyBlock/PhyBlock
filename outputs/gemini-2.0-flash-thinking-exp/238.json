Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n**Left Structure:**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 7 blocks and has 3 distinct layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of four blocks arranged horizontally from left to right: a green rectangular block, a yellow rectangular block, a blue square block, and an orange cylinder. The green block is to the left of the yellow block, the yellow block is to the left of the blue block, and the blue block is to the left of the orange cylinder.\n    - **Layer 2 (Middle):** A red square block is placed centrally on top of the yellow and blue blocks from the layer below.\n    - **Layer 3 (Top):** A red arch block is placed on top, spanning across the red square block and partially resting on the orange cylinder from the bottom layer.\n\n**Right Structure:**\n- **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 8 blocks and has 2 distinct layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Consists of four blocks: an orange arch block at the base, an orange horizontal rectangular block placed on top of the arch, and two orange wedge blocks positioned on either side of the arch and partially under the rectangular block, forming a stable base. The wedges are oriented with their sloping sides facing inwards and upwards.\n    - **Layer 2 (Top):**  Four blocks are placed on top of the first layer. A green square block is placed on the left wedge, a blue square block is placed on the right wedge, a red square block is placed on the orange rectangular block, and an orange wedge block is placed on top of the orange arch block from the bottom layer.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**For the Left Structure:**\n- Green Rectangular Block (horizontal): Index 8\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (horizontal): Index 7\n- Blue Square Block: Index 4\n- Orange Cylinder: Index 11\n- Red Square Block: Index 6\n- Red Arch Block: Index 1\n\n**For the Right Structure:**\n- Orange Arch Block: Index 15\n- Orange Rectangular Block (horizontal): Index 12\n- Orange Wedge (left): Index 14\n- Orange Wedge (right): Index 16\n- Green Square Block: Index 5\n- Blue Square Block: Index 4\n- Red Square Block: Index 6\n- Orange Wedge (top): Index 13\n\n**Combined Block List (for both structures in the main image):**\n- Index 8\n- Index 7\n- Index 4 (used twice)\n- Index 11\n- Index 6 (used twice)\n- Index 1\n- Index 15\n- Index 12\n- Index 14\n- Index 16\n- Index 5\n- Index 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis and selected blocks, a possible assembly order is as follows (building both structures sequentially from left to right):\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```"

The bottom layer consists of two orange wedge-shaped blocks, and the top layer has one blue rectangular block.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n    - **Bottom Layer:** Two orange wedge blocks are placed side-by-side, forming a base. The sloped sides of these wedge blocks face outwards.\n    - **Top Layer:** A blue rectangular block is placed centrally on top of the two orange wedge blocks, bridging across them. It appears to be resting on the flat top surfaces of the wedge blocks.\n\n## 2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n- **Needed Blocks:** Based on the target image and the dictionary, we need:\n    - One blue rectangular block (appears cubic from the given angle).\n    - Two orange wedge-shaped blocks.\n- **Block Indices:**\n    - For the blue rectangular block, index **1** matches the shape, color, and orientation.\n    - For the orange wedge block on the left side of the target image, index **10** appears to be the correct match in shape, color, and orientation.\n    - For the orange wedge block on the right side of the target image, index **14** appears to be the correct match in shape, color, and orientation.\n- **List Block Indices:** 1, 10, 14\n\n## 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n- **Inference of Order:** To build this structure, it's logical to start with the base layer and then place the top layer block.\n    - **Step 1:** Place the first orange wedge block (index 10) as the left base block.\n    - **Step 2:** Place the second orange wedge block (index 14) as the right base block, adjacent to the first one.\n    - **Step 3:** Place the blue rectangular block (index 1) on top, centered on the two orange blocks.\n- **Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 10\n  Step2: Move block with index 14\n  Step3: Move block with index 1\n}\n```"

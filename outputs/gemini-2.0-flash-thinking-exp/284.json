The main structure on the left has 9 blocks and the structure on the right has 3 blocks. The main structure on the left has **3 layers**. The structure on the right is vertically stacked and can be considered as having 3 layers as well.\n    -   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        -   **Main Structure (Left):**\n            -   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Three red arch blocks are placed side-by-side horizontally.\n            -   **Layer 2 (Middle):**  A blue cube sits on the leftmost red arch, an orange cube on the middle red arch, and a horizontal green rectangular block on the rightmost red arch. A yellow half-cylinder block is placed on top of the blue and orange cubes, spanning across them.\n            -   **Layer 3 (Top):** Two yellow vertical rectangular blocks are placed on top. One is positioned on the left side of the yellow half-cylinder and the other on the right side, also partially on the green rectangular block below.\n        -   **Secondary Structure (Right):**\n            -   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red arch block is placed standing vertically, opening to the left.\n            -   **Layer 2 (Middle):** A horizontal green rectangular block is placed inside the red arch, resting on the bottom curve.\n            -   **Layer 3 (Top):** Another red arch block is placed on top of the green rectangular block, also standing vertically and opening to the left, mirroring the bottom red arch.\n\n2.  **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n    -   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n        -   Red Arch (bottom layer, main structure, x3): Index 1\n        -   Blue Cube (middle layer, main structure): Index 5\n        -   Orange Cube (middle layer, main structure): Index 6\n        -   Green Horizontal Block (middle layer, main structure): Index 7\n        -   Yellow Half-cylinder (middle layer, main structure): Index 14\n        -   Yellow Vertical Block (top layer, main structure, x2): Index 11\n        -   Red Arch (vertical, secondary structure, x2): Index 4\n        -   Green Horizontal Block (middle layer, secondary structure): Index 7\n\n3.  **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n    -   **Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n    \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n    \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n    \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 4\"\n}\n```"

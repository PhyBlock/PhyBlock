Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure is composed of **18 blocks** in total.\n    *   The structure has **4 distinct layers** at its highest point, but can be viewed as having up to 5 layers if we separate the two towers.\n\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   Contains 8 blocks.\n        *   Consists of 4 layers.\n            *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 orange cylinders.\n            *   Layer 2: 2 horizontal yellow rectangular prisms placed on top of the cylinders.\n            *   Layer 3: 2 orange roof blocks placed on top of the yellow prisms, angled outwards.\n            *   Layer 4 (Top): 2 orange cylinders stacked on top of the roof blocks.\n\n    *   **Right Structure:**\n        *   Contains 10 blocks.\n        *   Consists of 4 layers.\n            *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 2 red arches forming a base.\n            *   Layer 2: 2 yellow half-cylinders placed on the arches, a blue cube in the center between them, and a shorter vertical green rectangular prism behind the cube and half-cylinders.\n            *   Layer 3: 2 taller vertical yellow rectangular prisms on top of the half-cylinders, and an orange cube on top of the blue cube.\n            *   Layer 4 (Top): A taller vertical green rectangular prism on top of the green rectangular prism from layer 2.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The structure is divided into two distinct parts, left and right, positioned separately on the ground plane.\n    *   **Left Structure:**  Blocks are stacked vertically, starting with cylinders at the base, followed by horizontal rectangular prisms, roof blocks, and finally cylinders at the top.\n    *   **Right Structure:**  Arches form a base, with half-cylinders, a cube, and a rectangular prism placed on top. Vertical rectangular prisms and a cube are stacked further up, topped by another vertical rectangular prism.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks and Indices:**\n    *   Red Arch (x2): Index 1\n    *   Blue Cube (x1): Index 3\n    *   Orange Cube (x1): Index 4\n    *   Green Rectangular Prism (Vertical, Taller) (x1): Index 5\n    *   Green Rectangular Prism (Vertical, Shorter) (x1): Index 6\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism (Horizontal) (x2): Index 8\n    *   Yellow Rectangular Prism (Vertical, Taller) (x2): Index 9\n    *   Orange Cylinder (x4): Index 11\n    *   Yellow Half-Cylinder (x2): Index 12\n    *   Orange Roof Block (x2): Index 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (Arch 1)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (Arch 2)\n    Step3: Move block with index 12 (Half-Cylinder 1)\n    Step4: Move block with index 12 (Half-Cylinder 2)\n    Step5: Move block with index 3 (Blue Cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 6 (Green Rectangular Prism - Shorter)\n    Step7: Move block with index 9 (Yellow Rectangular Prism - Vertical 1)\n    Step8: Move block with index 9 (Yellow Rectangular Prism - Vertical 2)\n    Step9: Move block with index 4 (Orange Cube)\n    Step10: Move block with index 5 (Green Rectangular Prism - Taller)\n    Step11: Move block with index 11 (Orange Cylinder 1)\n    Step12: Move block with index 11 (Orange Cylinder 2)\n    Step13: Move block with index 8 (Yellow Rectangular Prism - Horizontal 1)\n    Step14: Move block with index 8 (Yellow Rectangular Prism - Horizontal 2)\n    Step15: Move block with index 16 (Orange Roof Block 1)\n    Step16: Move block with index 16 (Orange Roof Block 2)\n    Step17: Move block with index 11 (Orange Cylinder 3)\n    Step18: Move block with index 11 (Orange Cylinder 4)\n}\n```"

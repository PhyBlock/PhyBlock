The yellow block is placed centrally on top of the green block. The red arch block is placed centrally on top of the yellow block and the orange triangular prism is placed on top of the arch.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n- **Count:** 6 blocks\n- **Layers:** 2\n    - Layer 1 (Bottom): Two red arch blocks placed side-by-side in the center. Two green vertical rectangular blocks are placed at either end of the arch blocks.\n    - Layer 2 (Top): Two yellow horizontal rectangular blocks are placed on top of the red arch blocks. Two yellow vertical rectangular blocks are placed on top of the green vertical rectangular blocks.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** Two red arch blocks form the central base. Green vertical rectangular blocks are placed at the ends of the arch block assembly. Yellow horizontal blocks are placed on top of the arch blocks, and yellow vertical blocks are placed on top of the green blocks.\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**For Structure 1 (Left):**\n- Green horizontal rectangular block: Index 2\n- Yellow horizontal rectangular block: Index 6\n- Orange triangular prism block: Index 15\n- Red arch block: Index 1\n\n**For Structure 2 (Right):**\n- Red arch block: Index 1 (Used twice)\n- Green vertical rectangular block: Index 3 (Used twice)\n- Yellow horizontal rectangular block: Index 6 (Used twice)\n- Yellow vertical rectangular block: Index 8 (Used twice)\n\n## Determined Assembly Order:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 15\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 3\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 6\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 8\n}"

Block 1 (Red block with arch)\n    2. Block 4 (Yellow block)\n    3. Block 12 (Red block, vertical)\n    4. Block 16 (Orange block, pyramid)\n\n  - Right Structure (1 Layer):\n    1. Block 11 (Orange block)\n    2. Block 5 (Blue block)\n    3. Block 2 (Green block)\n\n- **Block Indices**: \n  - Left Structure: 1, 4, 12, 16\n  - Right Structure: 11, 5, 2\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nFollowing the selected blocks, the step-by-step assembly sequence is as follows:\n\n```plaintext\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 4\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 16\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 2\n}\n```",

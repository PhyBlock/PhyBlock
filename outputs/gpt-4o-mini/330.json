Below are the selected blocks needed for the target structure:\n\n- **Upper Layer:**\n  1. **Block 6:** Green rectangular block (vertical)\n  2. **Block 7:** Yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n  3. **Block 10:** Orange triangular block (base facing down)\n\n- **Lower Layer:**\n  4. **Block 9:** Green square block (base)\n  5. **Block 12:** Orange cylindrical block (vertical)\n\n### Selected Block Indices:\n- Block Indices: 6, 7, 10, 9, 12\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nHere is the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n}\n```",

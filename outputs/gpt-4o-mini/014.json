Block 5: Red arch block\n2. Block 9: Red rectangular block\n3. Block 12: Orange triangular block\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nBased on the selected blocks, the assembly sequence is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n}\n```",

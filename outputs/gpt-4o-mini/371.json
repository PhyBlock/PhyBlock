The left structure has:\n   - A red rectangular block at the base.\n   - Above it, there’s a yellow semicircular block connected to a blue rectangular block.\n   - On top of the blue block, there’s a small red triangular block, forming a roof shape.\n   \n2. The right structure has:\n   - At the base, there’s a red square block.\n   - On it, there’s a blue square block.\n   - There’s a green rectangular block on top of the blue one.\n   - Finally, on top of the green block, a small red triangular block acts as a roof.\n   - The special feature is a circular cutout in the center of the structure.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis of the main target image, the following blocks from the Block Dictionary are needed:\n\n1. **Block 1** - Red rectangular block (base of the left structure)\n2. **Block 9** - Yellow semicircular block (middle of the left structure)\n3. **Block 5** - Blue rectangular block (top of the left structure)\n4. **Block 12** - Red triangular block (roof of the left structure)\n5. **Block 5** - Red square block (base of the right structure)\n6. **Block 4** - Blue square block (middle of the right structure)\n7. **Block 6** - Green rectangular block (top of the right structure)\n8. **Block 12** - Red triangular block (roof of the right structure)\n\n### Assembly Instructions\n\nThe assembly order based on the selected blocks is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 5\n   Step6: Move block with index 4\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 12\n}\n```",

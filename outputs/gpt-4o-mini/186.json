Block 1 (red arch) - used **1 time**\n2. Block 2 (blue cube) - used **1 time**\n3. Block 4 (green rectangle) - used **1 time**\n4. Block 6 (yellow rectangle) - used **2 times**\n5. Block 8 (orange cylinder) - used **1 time**\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nFollowing the analysis and block selection, here is the step-by-step assembly order:\n\n```plaintext\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 4\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 2\n}\n``` \n\nThese instructions ensure the correct and coherent assembly of the structure displayed in the main target image.",

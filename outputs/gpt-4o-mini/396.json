A pyramid block (orange) sits on top of the blue rectangle. There are three additional orange pyramid blocks arranged around the base, angled outward.\n   - The structure on the right has two vertical orange cylinders as the base. On top of these cylinders is a yellow rectangular block, with a smaller orange pyramid block placed on top of the yellow block.\n\n### Block Dictionary Selection\n1. **Identify Needed Blocks**:\n   - From the dictionary, we need to select blocks matching the following descriptions for the left and right structures:\n     - **Left Structure**:\n       - 1 vertical orange cylinder (Index 6)\n       - 1 blue rectangle (Index 3)\n       - 1 orange pyramid (Index 12)\n       - 3 orange pyramids (Index 12, used three times)\n     - **Right Structure**:\n       - 2 vertical orange cylinders (Index 6, used twice)\n       - 1 yellow rectangle (Index 2)\n       - 1 orange pyramid (Index 12)\n\n2. **List Block Indices**:\n   - **Total Required Block Indices**:\n     - For the left structure:\n       - Index 6 (1x)\n       - Index 3 (1x)\n       - Index 12 (4x - three additional pyramids)\n     - For the right structure:\n       - Index 6 (2x)\n       - Index 2 (1x)\n       - Index 12 (1x)\n\n### Assembly Order\n```plaintext\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 6\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n}\n```",

The bottom layer has 3 blocks, and the top layer has 4 blocks.\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**:\n   - **Bottom Layer**:\n     - 2 circular orange blocks (indices 9) are positioned vertically.\n     - A yellow block (index 6) is placed horizontally across the two orange blocks.\n     - A blue square block (index 4) sits on top of the yellow block.\n   - **Top Layer**:\n     - On the yellow block, there are two blue square blocks (index 4) adjacent to each other on each side.\n     - A red semi-circular arch block (index 2) sits on top of the blue square blocks.\n     - A red triangular block (index 11) is placed on top above the arch.\n\n### Required Blocks from the Dictionary\nBased on the described properties of the target structure, the selected blocks are:\n\n1. Orange circular block (index **9**) - 2 times\n2. Yellow block (index **6**) - 1 time\n3. Blue square block (index **4**) - 3 times\n4. Red semi-circular block (index **2**) - 1 time\n5. Red triangular block (index **11**) - 1 time\n\n### Assembly Order\nHere is the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 2\n   Step7: Move block with index 11\n}\n``` \n\nThis sequence details how to assemble the structure from the building blocks step-by-step, ensuring that the arrangement matches the target image precisely.",

Orange triangle block (Index 13)\n  2. Green block (Index 5)\n  3. Blue block (Index 3)\n\n- **Right Structure:**\n  1. Red block with hollow area (Index 1)\n  2. Green block (Index 4)\n  3. Yellow block (Index 6)\n  4. Two yellow circular blocks (Index 9)\n\n### List of Block Indices\n- Left Structure: \n  - 13 (Orange triangle)\n  - 5 (Green block)\n  - 3 (Blue block)\n\n- Right Structure:\n  - 1 (Red block with hollow)\n  - 4 (Green block)\n  - 6 (Yellow block)\n  - 9 (Yellow circular block) - *used twice*\n\n### Assembly Order\nBased on the selected blocks, the assembly order is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 13\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n}\n```",

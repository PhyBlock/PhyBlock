For the left (chair):\n   - **Block Indices:**\n     - Orange cylindrical block: 4\n     - Yellow rectangular block: 5\n     - Green rectangular block: 7\n     - Yellow half-cylinder block: 12\n\n2. For the right structure:\n   - **Block Indices:**\n     - Red rectangular block: 1\n     - Yellow square block: 5 (same as before)\n     - Blue cube block: 3\n     - Green rectangular block: 6 (same as before)\n     - Orange cylindrical block: 4 (same as before)\n\n### Assembly Order\n\n1. **Left Structure (Chair):**\n   ```\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 4 (Orange Cylinder)\n      Step2: Move block with index 4 (Orange Cylinder)\n      Step3: Move block with index 5 (Yellow Rectangle)\n      Step4: Move block with index 5 (Yellow Rectangle)\n      Step5: Move block with index 7 (Green Rectangle)\n      Step6: Move block with index 12 (Yellow Half-Cylinder)\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Right Structure:**\n   ```\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 4 (Orange Cylinder)\n      Step2: Move block with index 1 (Red Rectangle)\n      Step3: Move block with index 5 (Yellow Square)\n      Step4: Move block with index 3 (Blue Cube)\n      Step5: Move block with index 6 (Green Rectangle)\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Final Output \n\nFinal assembly steps for both structures are provided above, ensuring clarity and detail in the assembly process.",

Block index 1 (Red block with an arch)\n2. Block index 1 (Red block with an arch) - used again for symmetry.\n3. Block index 6 (Yellow block, rectangular)\n4. Block index 4 (Green block, rectangular)\n5. Block index 3 (Blue cube)\n6. Block index 3 (Blue cube) - used again.\n7. Block index 12 (Red block, rectangular)\n8. Block index 14 (Orange block, angled)\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nBased on the sequence identified, here are the step-by-step instructions:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 3\n   Step6: Move block with index 3\n   Step7: Move block with index 12\n   Step8: Move block with index 14\n}\n```",

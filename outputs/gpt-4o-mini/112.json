The bottom layer consists of two red curved blocks.\n  2. The middle layer has a blue square block and a green rectangular block positioned directly on top of the blue block.\n  3. The top layer contains an orange triangular block, which sits on the green block.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships**: \n  - The two red blocks (indices 1 and 2) are adjacent to each other at the base.\n  - The blue block (index 4) sits directly atop the two red blocks in the center. \n  - The green block (index 8) is positioned directly above the blue block.\n  - The orange triangular block (index 16) is placed on top of the green block.\n\n### Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\n- **Based on the structure, the following blocks are required**:\n  - Red curved block (index 1)\n  - Red curved block (index 2)\n  - Blue square block (index 4)\n  - Green rectangular block (index 8)\n  - Orange triangular block (index 16)\n\n### List of Block Indices\n\nThe selected block indices for constructing the structure are:\n- 1\n- 1 (second instance)\n- 4\n- 8\n- 16\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nThe following steps outline the assembly sequence to recreate the target structure:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 16\n}\n```",

Layer 1: 1, 2, 10, 5\n2. Layer 2: 7, 9, 9\n3. Layer 3: 1, 2\n\n### Assembly Instructions\n\nThe sequence to assemble the structure is as follows:\n\n```plaintext\n{\n   Step 1: Move block with index 10  // Place the orange cylinder first\n   Step 2: Move block with index 1   // Place the red arch block in front of the cylinder\n   Step 3: Move block with index 2   // Place the red rectangle behind the arch\n   Step 4: Move block with index 5   // Place the green triangle on top of the first layer\n   Step 5: Move block with index 9   // Place the green rectangle vertically next to the yellow block\n   Step 6: Move block with index 7   // Place the yellow block on top of the two green rectangles\n   Step 7: Move block with index 9   // Place the second green rectangle on the other side\n   Step 8: Move block with index 2   // Place the orange triangle block on the top layer\n   Step 9: Move block with index 1   // Place another red rectangle in position\n}\n```",

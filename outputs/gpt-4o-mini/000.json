Block 1: Red arch block\n2. Block 8: Yellow half-cylinder block\n3. Block 5: Blue square block\n4. Block 6: Red rectangular block\n5. Block 12: Orange triangular roof block\n\n### List of Block Indices\n- Red arch block (Block 1)\n- Yellow half-cylinder block (Block 8)\n- Blue square block (Block 5)\n- Red rectangular block (Block 6)\n- Orange triangular roof block (Block 12)\n\n### Assembly Order\nThe step-by-step assembly sequence to construct the structure is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n}\n```",

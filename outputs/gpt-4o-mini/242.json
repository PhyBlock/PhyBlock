There’s a triangular block (orange) at the front of the structure.\n\n### Selection of Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the description, the blocks required to construct the target image are as follows:\n\n1. **Left Structure (Vehicle)**:\n   - Orange cylindrical wheels (need index).\n   - Yellow curved block (index 12).\n   - Blue cube (index 2).\n\n2. **Right Structure**:\n   - Red block (index 1).\n   - Green block (index 5).\n   - Blue block (index 2) — already listed for the left structure.\n   - Yellow curved blocks (index 12) — already counted.\n   - Triangular block (index 16).\n\n### List of Block Indices Required\n- Left Structure:\n  - **Orange cylindrical wheel** (needs identification)\n  - **Yellow curved block**: 12 (2 required)\n  - **Blue cube**: 2\n\n- Right Structure:\n  - **Red block**: 1\n  - **Green block**: 5\n  - **Blue block**: 2\n  - **Triangular block**: 16\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nHere is the assembly instruction based on the selected blocks:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 10 (for wheels).\n   Step2: Move block with index 12 (yellow curved block).\n   Step3: Move block with index 2 (blue cube).\n   Step4: Move block with index 1 (red block).\n   Step5: Move block with index 5 (green block).\n   Step6: Move block with index 2 (blue block).\n   Step7: Move block with index 12 (yellow curved block).\n   Step8: Move block with index 16 (triangular block).\n}\n``` \n\nThis sequence carefully builds the desired target image from the provided blocks.",

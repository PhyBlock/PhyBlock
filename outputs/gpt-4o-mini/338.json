Move block with index **12** (4 times) to create the base.\n   - Position them in a rectangular formation to serve as the legs.\n2. Move block with index **10** (1 time) to sit on top of the orange cylinders.\n3. Move block with index **5** (1 time) to place on top of the yellow block.\n4. Move block with index **1** (1 time) for supporting the blue cube on the right.\n5. Move block with index **2** (1 time) to complete the support for the blue cube.\n6. Move block with index **4** to place the blue cube on the red curved blocks.\n\n### Final Assembly Instructions:\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 12\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 2\n   Step9: Move block with index 4\n}\n```",

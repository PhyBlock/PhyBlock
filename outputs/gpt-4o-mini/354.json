Block Index **1**: Red arch block\n2. Block Index **5**: Blue square block\n3. Block Index **9**: Yellow rectangular block\n4. Block Index **11**: Orange cylindrical block\n5. Block Index **12**: Another orange cylindrical block\n6. Block Index **1**: Red arch block (used again)\n7. Block Index **2**: Red arch block\n8. Block Index **16**: Orange pyramid block\n\n### List of Block Indices\n- 1 (Red arch)\n- 5 (Blue square)\n- 9 (Yellow rectangular)\n- 11 (Orange cylindrical)\n- 12 (Orange cylindrical)\n- 1 (Red arch)\n- 2 (Red arch)\n- 16 (Orange pyramid)\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nUsing the selected blocks, the step-by-step assembly sequence is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 11 (first orange cylindrical)\n   Step2: Move block with index 12 (second orange cylindrical)\n   Step3: Move block with index 1 (red arch block)\n   Step4: Move block with index 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n   Step5: Move block with index 5 (blue square block)\n   Step6: Move block with index 1 (red arch block)\n   Step7: Move block with index 2 (red arch block)\n   Step8: Move block with index 16 (orange pyramid block)\n}\n```",

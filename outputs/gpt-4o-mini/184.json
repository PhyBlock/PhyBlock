Red curved block - index **1**\n2. Red block (bottom layer) - index **4**\n3. Orange cylindrical block - index **9**\n4. Blue square block - index **5**\n5. Green triangle block - index **14**\n6. Yellow square block - index **7**\n\n#### List of Block Indices:\n- 1 (two times for the two curved blocks)\n- 4\n- 5\n- 7\n- 9\n- 14\n\n### Assembly Order\n\nThe step-by-step assembly sequence can be inferred as follows:\n\n```plaintext\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n}\n``` \n\nThis order ensures that the blocks are assembled in the required structure, layer by layer, from the base up to the top.",

Block Index 13 - Yellow block.\n2. Block Index 5 - Red block with a circular hole (middle layer).\n3. Block Index 1 - Red rectangular block (middle layer).\n4. Block Index 5 - Red arch block (for the bridge structure).\n5. Block Index 1 (again) - Red rectangular block (for the bridge structure).\n6. Block Index 1 (again) - Another red rectangular block (for the bridge structure).\n7. Block Index 9 - Green block (for horizontal section).\n8. Block Index 1 - Red block (for horizontal section).\n9. Block Index 7 - Blue block (for horizontal section).\n10. Block Index 10 - Yellow block (for horizontal section).\n\n### Assembly Instructions:\n\n``` \n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n}\n``` \n\nThis list provides a step-by-step instruction on how to assemble the structure outlined in the main target image using the appropriate blocks from the block dictionary.",

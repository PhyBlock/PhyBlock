The truck has two circular wheels (orange).\n   - **Tower Structure (Right)**:\n     - The base consists of a yellow block with an arch (block 1) on top of it.\n     - On top of the arch, thereâ€™s a red block (block 4) to the right and another yellow block (block 8) that connects to the vertical orange cylinder (block 9) next to it.\n     - At the very top, there is a red triangular block (block 16) which serves as the roof.\n\n### Required Blocks from the Block Dictionary\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Truck Components:**\n  - Block 4: Red block\n  - Block 2: Blue block\n  - Block 5: Green block\n  - Block 8: Yellow block\n  - Block 9: Orange circle (wheel) - two times\n\n- **Tower Components:**\n  - Block 1: Arch (red) \n  - Block 8: Yellow base for the top structure\n  - Block 9: Orange cylindrical block (for the vertical post)\n  - Block 16: Red triangular roof (on top of the setup)\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\n- For Truck: 5, 8, 2, 4, 9 (x2)\n- For Tower: 1, 8, 9, 16\n\n### Assembly Instructions\nThe assembly order inferred from the required blocks:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 5\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 8\n   Step9: Move block with index 9\n   Step10: Move block with index 16\n}\n```",

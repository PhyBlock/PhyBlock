Main Target Image:\n   - Displays the desired structure composed of various building blocks.\n   - Shows the overall layout, including how many blocks, the number of layers, and the spatial relationships between blocks.\n2. Block Dictionary Image:\n   - Contains a collection of sub-images, each showing a building block in a specific rotational orientation.\n   - Each sub-image has a block index marked at the lower right corner.\n\n## Steps to Complete the Task:\n1. **Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n   - **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 3 blocks. It has 2 layers: the bottom layer has 2 cylindrical blocks, and the top layer has 1 rectangular block.\n   - **Spatial Relationships:** The 2 cylindrical blocks are adjacent to each other horizontally. The rectangular block is placed on top of the cylindrical blocks, centered between them.\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n   - **Identify Needed Blocks:** \n     - 2 orange cylindrical blocks (bottom layer)\n     - 1 yellow rectangular block (top layer)\n     - 1 blue rectangular block (top layer)\n   - **List Block Indices:**\n     - Orange cylindrical block: Index 13\n     - Orange cylindrical block: Index 14\n     - Yellow rectangular block: Index 6\n     - Blue rectangular block: Index 1\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n   - **Inference of Order:**\n     - Step 1: Move block with index 13 (left orange cylinder)\n     - Step 2: Move block with index 14 (right orange cylinder)\n     - Step 3: Move block with index 6 (yellow rectangle)\n     - Step 4: Move block with index 1 (blue rectangle)\n\n## Additional Guidelines:\n- Ensure your description of the main target image is thorough and covers all key details (block count, layers, spatial arrangement).\n- Carefully match each block’s rotational orientation as shown in the dictionary; no adjustments or rotations beyond the provided images are allowed.\n- Your final output must be organized and follow the given step-by-step format precisely."

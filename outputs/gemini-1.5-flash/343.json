There are three distinct levels, or “layers”, in the larger structure and one layer in the smaller structure.  \n\n**Spatial Relationships:**\n\n* **Smaller Structure (Left):**  A blue block is at the base.  A red block sits on top of the blue block. A green block sits on top of the red block. A yellow block with a triangular piece sits on top of both the green and red blocks.\n\n* **Larger Structure (Right):** Two orange cylindrical blocks form the base. A yellow block sits on top of these, spanning between them. A red arched block sits on top of the yellow block. A blue cube sits above the archway.  Another yellow block sits on top of the red archway, and the tall orange cylindrical block sits atop the entire structure.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n**Identified Needed Blocks:**  The blocks shown in the target image are matched below with indices from the dictionary:\n\n* **Smaller Structure:**\n    * Blue Cube: Index 6\n    * Red Block: Index 13\n    * Green Block: Index 7\n    * Yellow Block with Triangle: Index 14\n\n* **Larger Structure:**\n    * Orange Cylindrical Block (x2): Index 12 (used twice)\n    * Yellow Block: Index 10\n    * Red Arched Block: Index 2\n    * Blue Cube: Index 6\n    * Yellow Block: Index 10\n    * Orange Cylindrical Block: Index 12\n\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 6, 13, 7, 14, 12, 10, 2, 6, 10, 12\n\n## Determination of the Assembly Order:\n\nThe assembly order considers which blocks must be placed first to support the blocks above them.\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 12\nStep2: Move block with index 12\nStep3: Move block with index 10\nStep4: Move block with index 6\nStep5: Move block with index 2\nStep6: Move block with index 10\nStep7: Move block with index 12 \nStep8: Move block with index 6\nStep9: Move block with index 13\nStep10: Move block with index 7\nStep11: Move block with index 14\n}\n\n**Note:**  There are multiple correct assembly orders that would produce the same result, and this represents only one feasible approach. The smaller structure could have been built before or after the larger one.  This sequence prioritizes constructing the support structure of the larger building first.\n"

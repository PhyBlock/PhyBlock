Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 11 blocks in total. The tallest part of the structure has 4 layers; the other part has 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  The structure consists of two distinct parts.\n\n    * **Part 1 (Tall Structure):** This section is a tower-like structure. The bottom layer is a yellow block (9). On top of it is a red cylindrical block (3). Above that are two vertically oriented green and yellow blocks (6 & 11). Finally, an orange triangular block sits at the top (14).\n\n    * **Part 2 (Smaller Structure):** This part features a layer of two blue cubes (4,4).  On top of this is a green rectangular block (6), and on top of that, a red curved block (1). Finally, a small orange triangular block (15) is added.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, the following blocks are required:\n\n    * 1: Red curved block\n    * 3: Red cylindrical block\n    * 4: Blue Cube (x2)\n    * 6: Green Rectangular block (x2)\n    * 9: Yellow rectangular block\n    * 11: Yellow rectangular block (vertical)\n    * 14: Orange triangular block (point up)\n    * 15: Orange triangular block (point to the left)\n\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 9, 11, 14, 15\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly instructions below assume a bottom-up approach for building each section.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}\n```\n\nThis detailed analysis and assembly sequence are based on matching the blocks in the dictionary image to their exact orientations in the target structure. No rotations or adjustments are made.\n"

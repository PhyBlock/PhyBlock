            "text": "## Analysis of Main Target Image:\n\n**Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 12 blocks.  It's not easily defined in distinct layers, but considering vertical stacking, we can describe it in sections of layers: a 3-block base for the left section, a 4-block structure on the left, a 2-block base on the right, and a 3-block structure on the right.\n\n**Spatial Relationships:**\n\n* **Left Section:** A red arch (block 2) forms the base. On top of it is a red cylindrical block (10). Above the cylindrical block sits an orange triangular block (14). Next to this, we have a green block (5) sitting on the base. Next to the green block is an orange triangular block (13)\n\n* **Right Section:** A red arch (2) forms the base.  On top of that are two vertical green blocks (5).  Above them sits a yellow block (7).  Above the yellow block is an orange triangular block (14).\n\n\n\n## Block Selection:\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n* **Block Index 2:** Red arch (appears twice)\n* **Block Index 5:** Green rectangular block (appears twice)\n* **Block Index 7:** Yellow rectangular block (appears once)\n* **Block Index 10:** Red cylindrical block (appears once)\n* **Block Index 13:** Orange triangular block (appears once)\n* **Block Index 14:** Orange triangular block (appears twice)\n\n\n## Assembly Order:\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 10\nStep4: Move block with index 14\nStep5: Move block with index 5\nStep6: Move block with index 13\nStep7: Move block with index 5\nStep8: Move block with index 7\nStep9: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** This assembly order prioritizes building the base sections first, then stacking upwards.  There might be other valid assembly orders, as long as they result in the correct final structure and don't involve block rotations.  This order attempts to build each section independently before connecting them conceptually. A more realistic build might involve placing blocks that act as supporting structures first, and would need to be modified slightly.  However, with just visual input I have no way to determine weight, or inherent stability.\n"

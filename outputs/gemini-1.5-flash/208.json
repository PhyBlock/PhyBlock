            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the solution, following the steps outlined:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure A (Left):**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 5 blocks and has 5 layers.\n* **Spatial Relationships:** It's a vertical stack.  The large red block with a cutout forms the base and top.  A green block sits on top of a yellow block, nestled within the red frame. These form the middle section.\n\n\n**Structure B (Right):**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 7 blocks and has 3 layers.\n* **Spatial Relationships:** A blue cube forms the central base. Three orange triangular blocks are arranged around the blue cube forming the base layer.  A tall orange rectangular block sits on top of the blue cube, forming the second layer. Another orange triangular block is positioned at the very top.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n**Structure A:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**  Large red block with a vertical cutout (only one orientation fits), a green block (horizontal orientation), a yellow block (horizontal orientation). And two more large red blocks (vertical orientation).\n* **List Block Indices:** 3, 6, 10, 1,1\n\n**Structure B:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** One blue cube, three orange triangular blocks (specific orientation needed to fit together correctly), one tall orange rectangular block, and one more orange triangular block for the top.\n* **List Block Indices:** 4, 14, 14, 14, 16, 15\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n**Structure A:**\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 3\n  Step3: Move block with index 6\n  Step4: Move block with index 10\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\n**Structure B:**\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4\n  Step2: Move block with index 14\n  Step3: Move block with index 14\n  Step4: Move block with index 14\n  Step5: Move block with index 16\n  Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The exact order of placing the triangular blocks in Structure B (Steps 2-4) might need slight adjustment depending on how the blocks are handled and whether it's easier to place them one at a time, or if the three can be placed simultaneously. The provided order tries to build the structure from the bottom up.\n"

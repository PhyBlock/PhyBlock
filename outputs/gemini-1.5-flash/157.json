Structure 1 has 5 blocks and 3 layers. Structure 2 has 5 blocks and 3 layers.  In total, there are 10 blocks across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1:** The bottom layer consists of a green block (supporting the rest of the structure). The middle layer has a blue block centered on top of the green block. The top layer has three blocks forming a small triangular peak: a green block sits on the top left and another green block on the top right of the central blue block. An orange block is on top and in the center, forming the peak. Block 1 is on the bottom layer, blocks 5 and 6 are on the middle layer, and blocks 9, 13, and 14 are on the top layer.\n\n\n    * **Structure 2:** The bottom layer has a blue block.  The middle layer has a red block on top of the blue block, and a yellow block which spans two blocks across the width. The top layer consists of a green block on top of the red block. Block 5 is on the bottom layer, blocks 7 and 10 are in the middle layer, and blocks 6 and 14 are on the top layer.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** To reconstruct both structures, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14 (Block 14 is used twice).\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe following assembly order prioritizes building each structure independently for clarity.  A more condensed version could be implemented by interleaving steps from both structures based on actual physical building constraints (which block is being placed and if the lower structure is stable enough to place a block on it).\n\n**{**\n**Structure 1:**\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 5\nStep3: Move block with index 6\nStep4: Move block with index 9\nStep5: Move block with index 13\nStep6: Move block with index 14\n\n**Structure 2:**\nStep7: Move block with index 5\nStep8: Move block with index 7\nStep9: Move block with index 10\nStep10: Move block with index 6\nStep11: Move block with index 14\n\n**}**\n\nThis provides a clear step-by-step assembly sequence to build both structures from the provided blocks.  Remember that the orientation of the blocks in the dictionary must be strictly adhered to.\n"

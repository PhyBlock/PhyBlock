The left structure has 5 blocks and 3 layers. The right structure has 5 blocks and 2 layers.  In total, there are 10 blocks across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):**\n    * Bottom layer: Block 9 (yellow rectangular prism) is the base.\n    * Middle layer: Two identical blocks (block 11, orange cylinder) are placed on top of block 9.\n    * Top layer: Block 6 (red cube) sits on top of the cylinders. Above block 6 is a small structure consisting of block 14 (orange triangular prism) at the base, topped with block 7 (blue cube).\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):**\n    * Bottom layer:  Block 9 (yellow rectangular prism) forms the base. Block 2 (red arched block) is positioned centrally above it.\n    * Top layer: Block 14 (orange triangular prism) rests on top of block 2.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** To construct both structures, we require the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 2, 6, 7, 9, 9, 11, 11, 14, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe following assembly instructions describe building the structures independently, as the images do not show a combined final structure.\n\n\n**Left Structure Assembly:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 7\" \n}\n```\n\n**Right Structure Assembly:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Combined Assembly (assuming independent structures):**\n\nTo combine both structure assemblies, simply concatenate the above JSON objects (though not explicitly requested in the prompt).  Note that this implicitly assumes sufficient space to build both structures.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The image quality is slightly low, but I've made the best possible determinations of block types and orientations based on what's visible.  Slight variations in color might exist, but the shape and orientation are the critical matching criteria here.\n"

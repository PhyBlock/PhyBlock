The smaller structure has 4 blocks and 2 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Larger Structure):** The base layer consists of two vertical green blocks (index 6) side-by-side. The second layer has two orange cylindrical blocks (index 10) placed on top of the green blocks, aligned vertically. The top layer has two orange triangular blocks (index 14) placed on top of the cylindrical blocks, forming a small 'house' shape.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Smaller Structure):** The base layer has a yellow block (index 4) and a red block (index 3). The second layer has a green block (index 5) and an orange triangular block (index 14) on top.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Larger Structure):**\n    * Two blocks with index 6 (vertical green)\n    * Two blocks with index 10 (horizontal orange cylinder)\n    * Two blocks with index 14 (orange triangle)\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Smaller Structure):**\n    * One block with index 4 (yellow)\n    * One block with index 3 (red)\n    * One block with index 5 (horizontal green)\n    * One block with index 14 (orange triangle)\n\n* **List Block Indices:**  6, 6, 10, 10, 14, 14, 4, 3, 5, 14\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order is based on building the larger structure first, followed by the smaller structure.  A different order is possible, but this one ensures a stable base for both structures.\n"

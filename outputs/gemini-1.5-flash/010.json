Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks in total. It has three layers.  The bottom layer has three blocks, the middle layer has one, and the top layer has one.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** Three orange triangular prisms (index 11) form the base, arranged in a triangular formation. A blue cube (index 1) sits atop the center of the triangular base. An orange triangular prism (index 7) sits on top of the blue cube.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need three orange triangular prisms oriented as in block index 11, one blue cube oriented as in block index 1, and one orange triangular prism oriented as block index 7.\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [11, 11, 11, 1, 7]\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly to their orientations in the dictionary.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should consider stability.  It's best to place the base first and then build upwards.\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 11\n   Step2: Move block with index 11\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n}"

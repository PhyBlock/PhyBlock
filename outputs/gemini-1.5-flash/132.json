            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses a total of 7 blocks. It has two distinct layers.  The bottom layer has 2 blocks, and the top layer has 5 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The bottom layer consists of a single red block with two arches, oriented such that the arches face upwards. This is a single block, but appears as two separate arches. This red double arch block is the foundation of the structure.  The top layer has five green rectangular blocks placed vertically, with four on top of the red block and one on top of that. The arrangement is such that the green blocks form a vertical wall extending upward from the red block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need one red double-arch block and five green rectangular blocks.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Red double-arch block: Index 1\n    * Green rectangular blocks: Index 9 (x4), Index 13 (x1) (Although index 9 and index 13 look identical, we'll treat them as separate blocks, given our limited options).\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are selected to precisely match their orientation and appearance in the target image.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe order of assembly should prioritize stability and bottom-up construction.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The solution above assumes it is fine to have multiple copies of index 9. If only a single copy of any block is available, then the problem is unsolvable with the provided blocks.  The task requires us to place the green blocks vertically on top of the red one. If we are to follow the orientation strictly according to the block dictionary, then we only have a limited number of green blocks to stack. Thus the order and indices will have to change based on which block can be placed depending on its orientation.\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses three blocks: two cylindrical blocks and one rectangular block. It has two layers: the two cylindrical blocks form the base layer, and the rectangular block sits atop them.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** Two identical orange cylindrical blocks are placed parallel to each other, forming the base. A green rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the two cylinders, bridging the gap between them.  The cylinders are oriented vertically, and the rectangle is oriented horizontally.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need one horizontal green rectangular block and two vertically oriented orange cylindrical blocks.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Green Rectangular Block: Index 2\n    * Orange Cylindrical Block: Indices 7, 7 (Index 7 is used twice because two identical blocks are needed).\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** The blocks are matched in shape, color, and orientation as per the dictionary images.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n* **Inference of Order:** The cylindrical blocks must be placed first to form the base, before the rectangular block can be placed on top.\n\n* **Output Format:**\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7\n  Step2: Move block with index 7\n  Step3: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

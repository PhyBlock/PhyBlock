            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows a total of 12 blocks.  There are multiple layers in the structures, the taller structure has at least 4 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The image contains two distinct structures.\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Giraffe-like):** This is composed primarily of vertical orange cylinders (at least 4). A yellow block sits atop these cylinders.  A smaller orange block is angled on top of the yellow one, and a yellow half-cylinder is on top of that.\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Bench-like):** This structure consists of a base of two red arch-shaped blocks placed side-by-side. On top are three green blocks in a row, and then a single red block on top of those.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Blocks:**  To reconstruct the image, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n* **Block Indices:**\n\n    * Orange Cylinder: 8 (used multiple times)\n    * Yellow Block: 7\n    * Small Orange Block (triangle): 15\n    * Yellow Half-cylinder: 10\n    * Red Arch Block: 2 (used multiple times)\n    * Green Block: 6 (used multiple times)\n    * Red Block: 13 or 14 (either will work, given the image's resolution and angle)\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThis assembly order prioritizes building the structures independently, then combining them (if desired).  Note that this doesn't explicitly say to place the structures beside one another.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 13\" //Or 14\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The resolution of the provided images makes it slightly ambiguous whether index 13 or 14 should be used for the topmost red block on the bench-like structure.  Both are similarly-shaped and colored red blocks.  The assembly order above assumes index 13.   If you find index 14 to be a better fit due to a higher resolution image, feel free to make the substitution.\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 9 blocks.  It has three distinct layers in the main structure and a separate two block structure.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Base Layer (Main Structure):** Two red arch-shaped blocks (index 2) form the base, supporting the next layer.\n    * **Second Layer (Main Structure):** A green block (index 8) sits on top of the red arches.\n    * **Third Layer (Main Structure):** Two yellow blocks (index 10) are placed vertically on top of the green block.\n    * **Fourth Layer (Main Structure):**  An orange triangular block (index 16) rests on the yellow blocks.\n    * **Separate Structure:** A red arch block (index 3) is placed horizontally, and a blue cube block (index 7) is placed on top of it.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**  To reconstruct the target structure, we need the following blocks:\n    * Two blocks with index 2 (red arches)\n    * One block with index 8 (green block)\n    * Two blocks with index 10 (yellow blocks)\n    * One block with index 16 (orange triangular block)\n    * One block with index 3 (red arch)\n    * One block with index 7 (blue cube)\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 8, 10, 10, 16, 3, 7\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should build from the bottom up for stability.  The separate structure can be built separately and then placed.\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 8\nStep4: Move block with index 10\nStep5: Move block with index 10\nStep6: Move block with index 16\nStep7: Move block with index 3\nStep8: Move block with index 7\n}"

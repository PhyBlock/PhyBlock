            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the solution based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two structures.  The larger structure uses 5 blocks and has 3 layers. The smaller structure uses 3 blocks and has 2 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Larger Structure):** The structure is essentially an archway with a triangular peak.  Two triangular blocks (same orientation) form the slanted sides of the arch. A curved arch block is placed between the two triangular blocks forming the base of the arch. A small rectangular block sits atop the arch, and another triangular block is placed on top of the rectangular block forming the peak.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Smaller Structure):** This structure is a smaller version of the archway. It has two triangular blocks forming the sides and a curved arch block in between acting as the base.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Larger Structure):**\n    * Two triangular blocks oriented like block index 13\n    * One curved arch block like index 2\n    * One rectangular block like index 7\n    * One triangular block oriented like block index 14\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Smaller Structure):**\n    * Two triangular blocks oriented like block index 14\n    * One curved arch block like index 2\n\n* **List Block Indices (Larger Structure):** 13, 13, 2, 7, 14\n* **List Block Indices (Smaller Structure):** 14, 14, 2\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is inferred based on structural stability and the visual layering in the target image.\n\n**Larger Structure Assembly:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Smaller Structure Assembly:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```\n\n**Complete Assembly Instructions (Combining both structures):**  Since the structures are independent, you could present their assembly instructions separately or combine them sequentially.  Here's a combined version:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\", //Larger Structure\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\", //Smaller Structure\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```\n"

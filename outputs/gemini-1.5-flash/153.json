Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses a total of 7 blocks.  It has two distinct sections that could be considered as separate structures, each with multiple layers.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Left Section:** Two red blocks (arches) form the base. Atop these, a yellow rectangular block sits horizontally.  On top of the yellow block, another yellow block, vertically oriented, is placed.\n    * **Right Section:** A red block (arch) forms the base.  A green rectangular block is positioned horizontally on top. Atop that, an orange triangular block is placed.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Blocks:**\n    * Two red arched blocks (index 2)\n    * One yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 9)\n    * One yellow vertical rectangular block (index 11)\n    * One green horizontal rectangular block (index 5)\n    * One orange triangular block (index 13)\n* **List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 9, 11, 5, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nGiven the layered nature of the structure and the need to support upper blocks, a reasonable assembly order would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  There might be slightly different valid assembly sequences, especially for the 2 red blocks, which could be placed in either order initially. The provided order prioritizes placing base blocks first.\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 7 blocks.  The \"house\" structure on the left is 3 layers high, and the square structure on the right is 4 blocks high and wide.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Left Structure (House):** A red block (arch) forms the base. On top of it sits a blue block. Finally, an orange block is placed on top of the blue one.\n    * **Right Structure (Square):**  This structure is more complex.  It consists of a yellow block at the top, bottom, and sides. In the centre are two green blocks on the left and right, partially obscuring a red block with a circular hole in its center.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  By comparing the target image with the block dictionary:\n\n    * **Block 2:** Red arch\n    * **Block 5:** Blue cube\n    * **Block 13:** Orange triangular block\n    * **Block 11:** Yellow rectangular block (appears three times)\n    * **Block 9:** Green rectangular block (appears twice)\n    * **Block 1:** Red rectangular block with circular hole\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 2, 5, 13, 11, 11, 11, 9, 9, 1\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to consider which blocks must be placed first to provide support for the others.\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 13\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 11\n   Step9: Move block with index 11\n}\n\n\n**Important Note:** The instructions assume a flat surface to begin with and that blocks can be placed directly on top of each other without additional supports beyond those inherent to the blocks.  The order is structured to build the left structure (house) first, then build up the right structure (square) and ensure each block has the necessary support below it before the next block is added.\n"

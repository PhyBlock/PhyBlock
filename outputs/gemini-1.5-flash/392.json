It has three main vertical levels.  The small triangular and rectangular blocks form a smaller sub-structure at the base.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * The base consists of a triangular block (bottom left), followed by a green and then a blue rectangular block (stacked vertically) and finally a red block with a curved top on it.\n    * Two yellow rectangular blocks form the base of two columns.\n    * Two orange cylindrical blocks sit on top of the yellow blocks creating the columns.\n    * A red arched block is placed on top of the columns.\n    * Finally, an orange house-shaped block is placed on top of the arched block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on the visual analysis of both images.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Triangular Block: 13\n    * Green Rectangular Block: 7\n    * Blue Rectangular Block: 5\n    * Red Curved Block: 2\n    * Yellow Rectangular Block: 9 (x2)\n    * Orange Cylindrical Block: 12 (x2)\n    * Red Arched Block: 1\n    * Orange House-Shaped Block: 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should proceed from bottom to top and left to right, as this structure is likely unstable if constructed otherwise:\n\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 13\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n   Step7: Move block with index 12\n   Step8: Move block with index 12\n   Step9: Move block with index 1\n   Step10: Move block with index 16\n}"

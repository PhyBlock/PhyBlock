A yellow block with a green frame is placed next to an identical yellow block with a green frame.  These are separate, non-interlocking blocks.\n\n    * **Part 2 (Right):** A more complex, multi-layered structure. It begins with a green base block. On this sits an orange cylindrical block. Atop that, an orange triangular prism is positioned centrally. A yellow frame block rests on top of the orange prism, and finally, a small blue cube is placed in the center of this yellow frame.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**  To construct the target structure, the following blocks are required, based on the Dictionary Image.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Block 1: Blue Cube\n    * Block 3: Green Rectangular Prism\n    * Block 6: Yellow Rectangular Prism\n    * Block 7: Yellow Rectangular Prism\n    * Block 9: Orange Cylinder\n    * Block 14: Orange Triangular Prism\n    * Block 5: Green Rectangular Prism\n    * Block 8: Yellow Rectangular Prism\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly process, respecting the constraints that each block must be in the displayed orientation, should proceed as follows:\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 9\nStep2: Move block with index 14\nStep3: Move block with index 8\nStep4: Move block with index 1\nStep5: Move block with index 3\nStep6: Move block with index 6\nStep7: Move block with index 5\nStep8: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  Steps 7 and 8 show the assembly of the left-hand section. The order of these steps is not critical, as both are self-standing blocks.  Similarly, the order of the base blocks in the right section (3 and 6) could be switched. The given order prioritizes constructing the main vertical tower first.\n"

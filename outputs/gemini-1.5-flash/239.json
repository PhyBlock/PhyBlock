            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the solution based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two separate structures.  Let's call them Structure A (the larger, multi-layered structure) and Structure B (the smaller, cube-like structure).\n\n    * Structure A:  Uses 7 blocks, and has 3 visible layers (though some blocks may be partially obscured).\n    * Structure B: Uses 5 blocks, and has 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure A):**\n\n    * Layer 1 (base): A triangular block (pointing left) forms the base.\n    * Layer 2: Three vertical rectangular blocks are placed on top of the triangular block, forming a row.\n    * Layer 3: Two vertical blocks rest on top of the middle two blocks of the second layer, creating a peaked effect. One is shorter than the other.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Structure B):**\n\n    * Layer 1 (base): A green rectangular block forms the base.\n    * Layer 2: A red block with a semicircular cutout sits on top of the green block.  A smaller green square sits to its left.\n    * Layer 3: A small blue square sits on top of the lower green square.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure A:**\n    * Base: Index 13\n    * Vertical Blocks (Layer 2): Index 5 (x2) and Index 6\n    * Top Blocks (Layer 3): Index 6 and Index 10\n\n* **Structure B:**\n    * Base: Index 3\n    * Red Block: Index 1\n    * Small Green Square (Layer 2): Index 3\n    * Blue Square: Index 2\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 13, 5, 5, 6, 6, 10, 3, 1, 3, 2\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order reflects a bottom-up approach, adding layers one at a time.  It's important to note that there's some flexibility in the exact order within each layer of Structure A, as long as blocks are stacked appropriately.\n\n**Structure A Assembly:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step 1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step 2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step 3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step 4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step 5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step 6\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```\n\n**Structure B Assembly:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step 1\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step 2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step 3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step 4\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```\n\n\n**Complete Assembly (Combining both structures):**\n\nThis combined step-by-step instruction assumes a separate assembly for each structure.  A more complex combined instruction set would require defining a spatial relationship between Structure A and B, which is not defined in the prompt.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step 1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step 2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step 3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step 4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step 5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step 6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step 7\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step 8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step 9\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step 10\": \"Move block with index 2\"\n}\n```\n"

It's difficult to definitively define \"layers\" as the structure isn't perfectly layered, but we can describe it in terms of building stages or columns.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two distinct parts.\n\n    * **Part 1 (left):** This section is a more complex arrangement starting with a triangular block (base), followed by a cylindrical block, then a rectangular block, an arch block, a small triangle on top of the arch, and another rectangular block on top.\n\n    * **Part 2 (right):** This is a simpler, rectangular pillar-like structure consisting of horizontal blocks stacked vertically.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on visual comparison:\n\n    * Block 1:  Small triangular block (appears twice)\n    * Block 2: Arch-shaped block\n    * Block 5: Small square block\n    * Block 6: Small rectangular block (appears twice)\n    * Block 8: Small rectangular block\n    * Block 10:  Large rectangular block (appears twice)\n    * Block 11: Cylindrical block\n    * Block 14: Triangular block\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [1, 2, 5, 6, 6, 8, 10, 10, 11, 14]\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**  This order reflects a possible construction sequence.  Variations are possible as long as the final structure matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The assembly instructions provide a logical building sequence.  The exact steps might vary slightly depending on the method chosen to build the structure.  The critical aspect is that all blocks are used, and their orientations exactly match those shown in the dictionary image.\n"

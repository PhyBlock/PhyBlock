            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows a structure composed of 10 blocks.  It's arranged in two distinct parts. The left part is a three-layered structure (excluding the base on the ground), and the right part is a four-layered structure.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure (House-like):**  A green block (base) supports a blue block, which supports a red triangle block. There is an orange block behind the blue block. An orange-red archway-shaped block is attached to the green base in front, connecting to the left side of the blue block.  An orange triangular block is affixed atop the blue and orange block.\n\n    * **Right Structure (Giraffe-like):**  Two green blocks are placed vertically side-by-side forming the legs. A yellow block sits on top of the green blocks forming the base of the body. A tall orange cylindrical block sits atop the yellow block, forming the neck. A small yellow semi-circular block forms the head.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Needed Blocks:**  Based on the visual analysis, we need the following blocks from the dictionary image:\n\n* **List of Block Indices:**\n\n    1.  Green block: 5\n    2. Blue block: 4\n    3. Orange-red archway: 1\n    4. Orange rectangular block: 10\n    5. Orange triangular block: 16\n    6. Red triangular block: 15\n    7. Two green blocks: 5 and 5.\n    8. Yellow block: 9\n    9. Orange cylindrical block: 11\n    10. Yellow semi-circular block: 13\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nTo build the structure, it's important to build from the bottom up and left-to-right.  The assembly instructions are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  This assembly order prioritizes building each part of the structure individually before combining the two parts.  Slight variations in order might be possible within each part, but this order is logical and easy to follow.\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image shows a structure built with 10 blocks.  There are multiple layers in each of the two separate structures.\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two distinct parts.\n\n    * **Part 1 (Left):** This part has 5 blocks. It starts with block 3 (red curved piece) as the base. On top of that is block 5 (blue square block), then block 2 (red arch). Finally, blocks 13 and 14 are stacked to form the roof.\n\n\n    * **Part 2 (Right):**  This section also has 5 blocks. It starts with a base of block 1 (red arch). Above it is block 7 (green rectangular block).  Then comes block 11 (yellow rectangular block) which supports block 12 (orange cylinder). Block 16 (orange triangular block) sits on top of the cylinder.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** The blocks needed are as identified in the description of the spatial relationships above.\n* **List Block Indices:** [3, 5, 2, 13, 14, 1, 7, 11, 12, 16]\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nIt's crucial to assemble the structure bottom-up, layer-by-layer.  The assembly instructions are as follows:\n\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 16\"\n}\n```\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 9 blocks arranged in 4 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  The structure consists of two distinct parts.\n\n    * **Part 1 (Tall Structure):** This is a vertical stack. The bottom layer has two yellow cylindrical blocks (side-by-side). The next layer has a green block with a double-arch structure on top of the yellow cylinders. The third layer has an orange triangular block on top of the green arch.\n\n    * **Part 2 (Small Structure):** This structure is to the right and consists of an orange cylinder with a red arch-shaped block on top.  There are two orange triangular blocks underneath the cylinder, one on each side.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need to identify blocks matching the shapes, colors, and orientations in the main image.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**  Based on the dictionary image:\n    * Yellow Cylindrical Block: 6\n    * Green Arch Block: 4\n    * Orange Triangular Block: 14\n    * Orange Cylindrical Block: 9\n    * Red Arch Block: 2\n    * Orange Triangular Block: 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nWe'll construct this in two parts, then combine them.\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 6\nStep2: Move block with index 6\nStep3: Move block with index 4\nStep4: Move block with index 14\nStep5: Move block with index 9\nStep6: Move block with index 2\nStep7: Move block with index 14\nStep8: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nNote:  It is crucial to follow this order to ensure the structure's stability.  Placing the upper blocks before the lower ones would be impossible.  Building the two sections separately (Part 1 and Part 2) before placing them next to each other is implied but not explicitly stated in the step-by-step instructions as requested. The image doesn't give enough information to explicitly tell how to put the two parts together without assuming the simplest adjacency.  A more explicit instruction would need to specify \"Place part 2 [blocks 9,2,14,14] to the right of part 1.\"\n"

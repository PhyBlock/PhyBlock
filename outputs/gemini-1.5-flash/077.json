Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses six blocks in total and has three layers.  \n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is roughly symmetrical.  The base is formed by two orange, angled blocks (14) forming an archway.  Above the arch sits a red block (possibly 7 or another similar one not shown) directly over the center.  The top layer consists of a green block (6) to the left and a blue block (5) to the right of the central red block. These two blocks sit directly atop the orange base blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** To match the target structure precisely in shape, colour, and orientation we need the blocks listed below. Note that we assume block 7 to be similar to the central red block in orientation.  The dictionary lacks a suitable red block showing the correct orientation.\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 5 (blue cube), 6 (green cube), 14 (orange angled block) x2, 7 (red cube - Assuming a similar block exists that is not shown,  and the orientation matches).\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are selected to match the shape, color, and orientation as shown in the target image and in the dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe construction should start from the bottom layer and progress upwards, ensuring that each block's placement matches the main image:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 5\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The block index 7 is an assumption.  The provided dictionary lacks the precise red block needed in its correct orientation to build the structure.  The instructions assume that a similar red block does exist and the provided index 7 is a placeholder for that missing block.  If the correct red block with the right orientation is provided, the correct index should be used instead of 7.\n"

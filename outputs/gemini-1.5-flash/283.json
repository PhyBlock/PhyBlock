It has a maximum of 4 layers at the tallest point.\n\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure can be conceptually divided into two parts:\n\n    * **Left Part (Bridge):**  A red double-arch block (index 1) forms the base. Three green rectangular blocks (index 5) are placed on top, arranged horizontally.\n\n    * **Right Part (Tower):** Four orange cylindrical blocks (index 12) form the four legs. Two yellow rectangular blocks (index 11) are placed horizontally on top of these legs, forming a platform. Another orange cylindrical block (index 12) sits on this platform, and finally, a yellow half-cylinder block (index 14) tops the structure.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  The image needs blocks matching the shape, color, and orientation as described above.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Red double-arch block: 1\n    * Green rectangular block (x3): 5, 5, 5\n    * Orange cylindrical block (x5): 12, 12, 12, 12, 12\n    * Yellow rectangular block (x2): 11, 11\n    * Yellow half-cylinder block: 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nA reasonable assembly order, ensuring stability, would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 12\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\nThis order prioritizes building the base structures (bridge and tower legs) before adding the upper layers.  Alternative assembly orders are possible, but this sequence maintains stability during construction.\n"

The taller structure has 6 blocks and 6 layers. The shorter structure has 4 blocks and 4 layers.  In total, there are 10 blocks across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Taller Structure:** The base consists of two horizontally oriented arch blocks (red).  Atop this, a green block is placed centrally.  Above the green block sits a yellow block. The topmost layer is a small orange triangular block.\n    * **Shorter Structure:** This structure is a vertical stack. It begins with a red arch block, then a green block, followed by a yellow block, and finished with a red arch block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need to match the blocks based on their shape, color, and orientation.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Taller Structure: 1, 1, 5, 9, 7, 14\n    * Shorter Structure: 1, 5, 9, 1\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are chosen to precisely match the shape, color, and orientation from the dictionary.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to be inferred and should be performed layer by layer for both structures, to ensure stability.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order prioritizes building the base layer of each structure first, followed by subsequent layers, ensuring stability during construction.  Note:  This doesn't explicitly state placement, but assumes building a structure based on image implies spatial awareness of where each block should go relative to others.  A more detailed instruction set might specify placement (e.g., \"Place block index 1 on the left\").\n"

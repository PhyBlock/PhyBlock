            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 7 blocks.  It has two distinct sections, each appearing to be two layers high, though the overall arrangement isn't strictly layered.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Left Section:**  A red, curved block (similar to index 1 but potentially another orientation) forms the base. A second, identical red curved block sits atop the first, slightly offset. A blue cube (index 6) is placed on top of the second red curved block.\n    * **Right Section:**  A green cube (index 7) forms the left-most part of this structure. Two yellow curved blocks (similar to index 11, but potential orientation differences need to be checked) sit below and to the right of the green cube.  A blue cube (index 6) rests on top of the yellow curved blocks.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on a careful visual comparison, the required blocks are:\n\n    * Two red curved blocks (index 1 and index 5 potentially)\n    * Two blue cubes (index 6)\n    * One green cube (index 7)\n    * Two yellow curved blocks (index 11 potentially)\n\n* **List Block Indices:** Assuming indexes from the image are in correct orientation and similar blocks can have different index values:\n    Index 1, Index 5, Index 6, Index 6, Index 7, Index 11, Index 11\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** The blocks listed above exactly match the shape, color, and orientation as they appear in the target structure.  No rotations are needed.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nTo create an easily understandable assembly sequence, letâ€™s focus on building each half of the structure independently, then combining them:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5 on top of block 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6 on top of block 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 11 below and to the right of block 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 11 below and to the right of block 11\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 6 on top of the two blocks with index 11\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The block indices provided are tentative, dependent on the exact orientation of each block in the dictionary image.  If the orientations in the dictionary don't perfectly align with the target structure (which was a problem here), then different indices would be required and the assembly steps adjusted accordingly. A clearer, larger, or higher resolution dictionary image is crucial for a definite answer.\n"

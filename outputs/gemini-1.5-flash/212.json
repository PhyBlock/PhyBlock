The larger structure has 6 blocks and 4 layers. The smaller structure has 4 blocks and 2 layers.  In total, there are 10 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Larger Structure):** The base is a yellow block (index 10). On top sits a red block (index 7) with a hole.  Above that is a blue block (index 5), followed by a green block (index 6), and finally, an orange triangular block (index 14) on top.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Smaller Structure):** This structure is a smaller house-like shape. It has an orange triangular block (index 14) at its base, flanked by a green block (index 6) on each side, and topped by a smaller orange triangle (index 13).\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Needed Blocks:**  Based on visual comparison:\n    * Yellow block (index 10)\n    * Red block (index 7)\n    * Blue block (index 5)\n    * Green block (index 6)  (used twice)\n    * Orange triangular block (index 14) (used twice)\n    * Orange triangular block (index 13)\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 10, 7, 5, 6, 6, 14, 14, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should be bottom-up for each structure, then assembling the second structure. This ensures stability.\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10\nStep2: Move block with index 7\nStep3: Move block with index 5\nStep4: Move block with index 6\nStep5: Move block with index 14\nStep6: Move block with index 14\nStep7: Move block with index 6\nStep8: Move block with index 13\n}\n\n"

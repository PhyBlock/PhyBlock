It has 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is built symmetrically.  The bottom layer consists of two identical orange triangular prisms (pointing outwards) and two identical green rectangular prisms placed vertically between them and the central column. The second layer has an orange cylindrical block in the center. The top layer has a red arch-shaped block on top of the cylinder and a red triangular prism on top of the arch.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need to match the blocks based on shape, color, and orientation.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Orange triangular prism: 14 (x2)\n    * Green rectangular prism: 6 (x2)\n    * Orange cylindrical block: 9\n    * Red arch-shaped block: 1\n    * Red triangular prism: 10\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is inferred based on the layering and the stability of the structure.  It's important to start with the base and build upwards to avoid collapse.\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 14\n  Step2: Move block with index 14\n  Step3: Move block with index 6\n  Step4: Move block with index 6\n  Step5: Move block with index 9\n  Step6: Move block with index 1\n  Step7: Move block with index 10\n}\n\n"

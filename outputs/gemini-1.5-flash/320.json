Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main image shows two separate structures built with blocks.\n\n**Structure 1 (Tall Structure):** This structure consists of 4 blocks and has 3 layers.\n* Layer 1: Block 9 (orange cylinder)\n* Layer 2: Block 6 (green rectangular prism)\n* Layer 3: Two vertically stacked blocks, both are Block 5 (green rectangular prism)\n\n**Structure 2 (Rocket Structure):** This structure consists of 6 blocks and has 3 layers.\n* Layer 1: Block 13 (red triangular prism)\n* Layer 2: Block 3 (red curved block) + Block 10 (yellow curved block) + Block 10 (yellow curved block)\n* Layer 3: Block 1 (red curved block) + Block 14 (red triangular prism)\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Structure 1:**\n    * Block 9\n    * Block 6\n    * Block 5\n    * Block 5\n\n* **Structure 2:**\n    * Block 13\n    * Block 3\n    * Block 10\n    * Block 10\n    * Block 1\n    * Block 14\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 9, 6, 5, 5, 13, 3, 10, 10, 1, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The assembly order for the rocket structure is somewhat arbitrary. It's possible to build some of the lower layers before the top. The provided order is one possible sequence.  Also note that the structure on the right is built somewhat ambiguously - the order of Block 1 and Blocks 10 in the middle is not explicitly defined and both orders would produce the same structure.\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  The structure on the left has 5 blocks and appears to have 3 layers. The structure on the right has 5 blocks and appears to have 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):**\n    * A yellow rectangular block (7) sits on top.\n    * A red arch-shaped block (1) forms the main body.\n    * Two smaller red arch-shaped blocks (1) are placed beneath and to the sides, creating the supports.\n    * Another yellow rectangular block (7) is on top of the supports.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):**\n    * An orange triangular block (14) forms the base.\n    * A blue square block (6) sits centrally on the base.\n    * An orange cylinder (10) rests on the blue square block.\n    * Two more orange triangular blocks (14) are positioned on top of the central cylinder.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Left Structure Block Indices:** 1, 1, 1, 7, 7\n* **Right Structure Block Indices:** 14, 6, 10, 14, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to account for the need to place blocks *below* others in a stable manner.\n\n**Left Structure Assembly:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\"\n}\n```\n\n**Right Structure Assembly:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The assembly order for both structures is a suggested sequence to build stably.  Alternative sequences might also work depending on the stability of the blocks and support surface.  The index numbers specifically indicate the orientation of the blocks must match those in the dictionary precisely.\n"

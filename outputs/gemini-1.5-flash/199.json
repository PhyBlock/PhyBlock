            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 12 blocks.  It appears to have two main sections, and it's difficult to define layers precisely due to the irregular stacking but we can say there are blocks at different heights.\n\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  The structure is composed of two distinct parts.\n\n    * **Part 1 (Bridge-like structure):** This section consists primarily of two red blocks (index 1) stacked horizontally, with a yellow block (index 7) placed on top.\n\n    * **Part 2 (Irregular Stack):** This includes a stack of 3 blue cubes (index 3) on top of a green block (index 4), which in turn sits on top of a red block (index 1) oriented horizontally.  There is a further irregular stack of blocks.  A yellow block (index 10) is at the base. This block supports a curved red piece (index 2). On top of the curved red piece is a small orange triangular block (index 14).  Finally, a red triangular block (index 11) is added onto the structure.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** To build the structure, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n    * Two of block index 1\n    * One of block index 2\n    * Three of block index 3\n    * One of block index 4\n    * One of block index 7\n    * One of block index 10\n    * One of block index 11\n    * One of block index 14\n\n* **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nDetermining the exact assembly order requires considering stability. A bottom-up approach is most logical.  However, some blocks may be placed temporarily to support others before their final position is set.\n\n\n{\n   Step 1: Move block with index 10\n   Step 2: Move block with index 7\n   Step 3: Move block with index 1\n   Step 4: Move block with index 1\n   Step 5: Move block with index 4\n   Step 6: Move block with index 3\n   Step 7: Move block with index 3\n   Step 8: Move block with index 3\n   Step 9: Move block with index 2\n   Step 10: Move block with index 11\n   Step 11: Move block with index 14\n}\n\n**Note:** This assembly order assumes blocks can be temporarily placed to assist in building higher sections.  A more detailed, physically precise order would require further analysis of the interlocking nature of the blocks, but this sequential approach provides a reasonable approximation.\n"

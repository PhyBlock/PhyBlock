            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  The left structure uses 5 blocks and has 2 layers. The right structure uses 7 blocks and has 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):** Three orange triangular blocks form a base. A blue square block sits atop the center of the triangular base.  A single orange rectangular block sits on top of the blue square block.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):** The base consists of two orange triangular blocks and a yellow square block. A red cylindrical block with a hole sits on top of this base. Above the cylinder is a green square block followed by a blue square block and finally an orange triangular block sits at the top.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Left Structure):**\n    * Orange triangular block: index 12\n    * Blue square block: index 5 or 9  (Both are identical, either would work)\n    * Orange rectangular block: index 10\n\n* **Needed Blocks (Right Structure):**\n    * Orange triangular block: index 12\n    * Yellow square block: index 7\n    * Red cylindrical block with hole: index 1\n    * Green square block: index 6\n    * Blue square block: index 5 or 9 (Both are identical, either would work)\n    * Orange triangular block: index 14\n\n* **List of Block Indices (Left Structure):**  12, 12, 12, 5, 10  (or 12,12,12, 9, 10)\n* **List of Block Indices (Right Structure):** 12, 7, 1, 6, 5, 14 (or 12,7,1,6,9,14)\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to be done separately for each structure.  I'll use the first variation for the indices of the left structure and the first variation for the right.\n\n**Left Structure Assembly:**\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 12\n  Step2: Move block with index 12\n  Step3: Move block with index 12\n  Step4: Move block with index 5\n  Step5: Move block with index 10\n}\n\n\n**Right Structure Assembly:**\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 12\n  Step2: Move block with index 7\n  Step3: Move block with index 12\n  Step4: Move block with index 1\n  Step5: Move block with index 6\n  Step6: Move block with index 5\n  Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n\n**Complete Assembly Instructions (Both structures):**\n\nCombine the assembly instructions above for both structures.  The order you assemble them doesn't inherently matter, but it could be more efficient to complete one before the other.\n\n"

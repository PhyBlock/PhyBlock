Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image shows a structure composed of 4 blocks in total, arranged in 2 layers.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  Two green blocks form the top and bottom of the structure, horizontally oriented.  Two yellow blocks are positioned vertically between the green blocks, creating a frame-like structure. The yellow blocks are aligned vertically and centrally placed between the green blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need two green horizontal blocks and two vertical yellow blocks.\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Green horizontal blocks: Index 1 and Index 2. (Either will work as they are identical.)\n    * Yellow vertical blocks: Index 9 and Index 10. (Either will work as they are identical.)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to consider the stability of the structure. It's important to place the base first and to avoid creating unbalanced stacks.\n\n* **Inference of Order:**\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n}\n\n\n**Explanation of Assembly Order:**\n\n1. **Step 1 (Index 1):** Place the first green block horizontally, establishing the base layer.\n2. **Step 2 (Index 9):** Place the first yellow block vertically, in the center of the green base. This starts building the central vertical structure.\n3. **Step 3 (Index 10):** Add the second yellow block to complete the central column. This ensures the structure remains stable and balanced.\n4. **Step 4 (Index 2):** Place the second green block on top to complete the frame.\n\n\nThis sequence prioritizes stability by building the vertical supports before the top layer.  Other sequences are possible, but this minimizes the risk of toppling.\n"

            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, analyzing the main image, selecting blocks, and providing assembly instructions:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses a total of 7 blocks.  There are two distinct structures. The first is a three-layer vertical stack, and the second is a two-block structure.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Structure 1 (Vertical Stack):**  A pair of cylindrical blocks (orange) forms the base. On top sits a green rectangular block, followed by a red square block and finally a blue square block.\n    * **Structure 2 (Triangle):**  An orange triangular block forms the base. A blue square block sits atop and centered on the orange triangular block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:**\n    * Block Index 1: Blue Square Block\n    * Block Index 2: Red Square Block\n    * Block Index 4: Green Rectangular Block\n    * Block Index 8: Orange Cylinder Block (x2)\n    * Block Index 11: Orange Triangular Block\n    * Block Index 14: Orange Triangular Block (though this might be a slight error in image interpretation, and it might actually be Block 11 as well. Due to the perspective, there's a small degree of ambiguity in how the block is oriented).\n\n* **Block Indices List:** 1, 2, 4, 8, 8, 11, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order prioritizes constructing the vertical stack first and then places the triangular structure.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** There's a slight ambiguity concerning the orientation of the second orange triangular block (in the step 7).  If the provided dictionary image 14 is not identical in orientation to what is depicted in the main image, and we are restricted to only using the images as provided, then step 7 would be impossible to achieve perfectly without image manipulation. If image 11 is intended, then replace Step 7 with the following:\n\n```json\n\"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n```\n\nThis revised instruction set assumes we can use Block 11 again for the second structure.  If we are strictly limited to using only one of each block type, the exact recreation is impossible without additional information or clarification.\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 8 blocks.  The taller structure on the left has three layers, while the castle-like structure on the right has three layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Left Structure:** This structure consists of three blocks. Two vertical, yellow blocks form the sides. A horizontal, green block connects the top of the yellow blocks.\n    * **Right Structure:** This is a more complex structure. It uses five blocks. Two orange cylindrical blocks act as towers on either side. A red block forms the base, with an archway shape.  A green block sits on top of the red block, and a blue block sits on top of the green block. Finally, a small orange triangular block sits atop the blue block as a roof.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need to match the blocks from the target image to the dictionary images.  Note that orientation matters, as no rotation is allowed.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Left Structure:\n        * Top green block: Index 6\n        * Yellow block (left): Index 8\n        * Yellow block (right): Index 8\n\n    * Right Structure:\n        * Orange cylindrical blocks (2): Index 10 (x2)\n        * Red block with archway: Index 2\n        * Green block: Index 6\n        * Blue block: Index 4\n        * Orange triangular roof: Index 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nTo build this structure from the bottom up, and left to right, the following order is recommended:\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 10\nStep4: Move block with index 6\nStep5: Move block with index 4\nStep6: Move block with index 14\nStep7: Move block with index 8\nStep8: Move block with index 8\nStep9: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the right-hand castle structure, then the left-hand structure.  Alternative assembly orders are possible, as long as they result in the correct final structure.  However, this sequence minimizes the potential risk of unstable structures during construction.\n"

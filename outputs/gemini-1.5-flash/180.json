Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two separate structures.  Structure 1 has 4 blocks and 4 layers. Structure 2 has 5 blocks and 3 layers. In total, there are 9 blocks and a maximum of 4 layers across both structures.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1:** A double cylinder (horizontal) forms the base. On top of this, there is a green rectangular block (horizontal). Above that is a red square block, and finally, a blue square block topped with an orange triangular block.\n\n    * **Structure 2:** Two orange vertical rectangular blocks form the base pillars.  On top of these is a yellow rectangular block (horizontal) acting as a bridge.  Above the yellow block sits an orange arch-shaped block. Finally, another orange triangular block sits atop the arch.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n\n    * Structure 1: 11, 5, 4, 3, 13\n    * Structure 2: 9, 9, 1, 13, 13\n\n* **Matching Criteria:**  Each block's orientation and color match exactly those in the dictionary image.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly instructions below prioritize building each structure independently for clarity.  A different order could be equally valid as long as it leads to the correct final structures without any rotations.\n\n\n**Assembly Instructions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Structure 1\": {\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n  },\n  \"Structure 2\": {\n    \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n    \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON format clearly separates the building instructions for each structure, making the assembly process more understandable.  Remember, this is one possible valid order, and other sequences achieving the same result are possible.\n"

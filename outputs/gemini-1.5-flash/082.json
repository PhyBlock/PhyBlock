Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 10 blocks in total, arranged across 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure resembles a rocket.  The base consists of two identical, slanted, orange blocks (blocks 14 and/or 16, one each). The next layer contains a red block with a cylindrical hole (block 1), which sits directly on top of the base blocks, and slightly offsets to the center. Atop this central red block sits another red block with a hollow upper portion (block 4). Two yellow blocks, each in the shape of a hollowed quarter-cylinder, are nestled into the hollow portions of block 4, one on each side (block 6 and potentially another block 6 or another similar block). The top layer is a single orange triangular block (block 12).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** To construct the rocket, we need specific blocks from the dictionary.  The rotations in the dictionary are critical.\n    * Base: Two blocks index 14 (or 16, since they are mirrored)\n    * Center Layer: Block index 1 and block index 4\n    * Top of Center Layer: Two blocks index 6.\n    * Top Layer: Block index 12\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [14, 14, 1, 4, 6, 6, 12]  Note: Using either 14 or 16 twice is valid based on mirroring.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should follow a bottom-up approach.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 12\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  There is a slight ambiguity. Blocks 14 and 16 appear to be mirror images.  The assembly instructions above use block index 14 twice.  If using block 16, replace the first or second \"14\" in the step list with \"16\", as the mirror placement will work in this construction. The end result should be the same.\n"

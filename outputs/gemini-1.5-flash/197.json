Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows two separate structures.  Structure 1 uses 3 blocks and has 2 layers. Structure 2 uses 4 blocks and has 2 layers.  In total, there are 7 blocks in the main image.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1:** A yellow block (horizontal) forms the base.  Atop this, sits a yellow cylinder, centered. On top of the cylinder sits a smaller orange triangular block.\n\n    * **Structure 2:**  A red block with arched openings forms the base. Two orange triangular blocks sit atop this base. Another red block with arched openings sits in the middle.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Blocks:**\n\n    * Structure 1: Block 5 (yellow horizontal), Block 7 (yellow cylinder), Block 13 (orange triangle)\n    * Structure 2: Block 1 (red arch), Block 1 (red arch), Block 14 (orange triangle), Block 14 (orange triangle)\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 5, 7, 13, 1, 1, 14, 14\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly to shape, color, and orientation as shown in the provided dictionary.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should be mindful of stacking. You cannot place a block on top of something that isn't already there.  A reasonable assembly order is presented below.  There may be slight variations depending on the order in which you assemble the two independent structures.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n"

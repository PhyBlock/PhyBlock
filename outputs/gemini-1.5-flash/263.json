Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image contains two separate structures.  The first structure (house-like) uses 3 blocks and has 2 layers. The second structure (pillar-like) uses 5 blocks and has 3 layers.  In total, there are 8 blocks in the main image.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (House):** A red arch-shaped block forms the base. A triangular orange block sits atop the arch, and another smaller triangular orange block sits on top of that one, completing the \"roof\".\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Pillar):** A yellow block forms the base.  A red block sits on top of the yellow one, followed by a blue block, and finally, a green block at the top. The top of the green block has a yellow block as a cap.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Needed Blocks:**\n\n    * Structure 1:  Block index 1 (red arch), Block index 14 (orange triangle), Block index 14 (orange triangle).\n    * Structure 2: Block index 9 (yellow block, horizontal), Block index 5 (red block), Block index 4 (blue block), Block index 7 (green block), Block index 9 (yellow block, horizontal).\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 1, 14, 14, 9, 5, 4, 7, 9\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should be based on building from the bottom up in each structure. Here's a possible assembly sequence:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** This assembly order assumes a reasonable bottom-up construction.  There might be other valid sequences, especially if placing blocks temporarily aside during the process is allowed (not explicitly stated as forbidden in the prompt).  However, this sequence prioritizes stacking blocks without needing to rearrange.\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image shows a structure composed of 11 blocks.  The taller structure on the left has four layers, while the shorter structure on the right has three layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Left Structure:**  A red, triangular block (top) sits atop two vertical orange cylinders, which in turn are on top of a yellow block with a circular hole.  This whole structure rests on a yellow rectangular block.\n    * **Right Structure:** A green block is at the base, topped by a red arch-shaped block (block 2). An orange cylinder sits atop this, and a final yellow rectangular block is placed on top.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** Based on visual comparison:\n\n    * Block Index 1: Red block with two openings\n    * Block Index 2: Red arch-shaped block\n    * Block Index 5: Green rectangular block\n    * Block Index 9: Yellow rectangular block\n    * Block Index 10: Yellow rectangular block\n    * Block Index 11: Orange cylinder\n    * Block Index 11: Orange cylinder\n    * Block Index 13: Orange rectangular block\n    * Block Index 15: Orange triangular block\n    * Block Index 16: Orange triangular block\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 11, 13, 15, 16\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**  There are several valid assembly orders. This one prioritizes building each structure independently, then combining them.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  The index 16 (orange triangular block) could be substituted for index 15 or vice-versa, depending on the perspective of the assembly.  Also, blocks 9 and 10 are interchangeable yellow blocks. The order of steps 5-10 could vary slightly and still yield a correct result.  This chosen order prioritizes completing the right-hand structure first, then completing and merging the two parts.\n"

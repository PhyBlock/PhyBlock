Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses a total of 10 blocks.  It has a maximum of 3 layers in the left structure and 3 layers in the right structure.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:**  A curved red block (base) supports a taller structure.  On top of the curved red block is a second curved red block. Atop this are a green block, a blue block, and finally a small orange gabled roof piece.\n\n    * **Right Structure:** A  curved red block arch forms the base. On top of this is a yellow block. Above that is a red hollow block with a circular hole, and finally another yellow block sits on top.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** We need the following blocks to perfectly match the target structure (using the corresponding index numbers from the Block Dictionary image):\n\n    * Left Structure: 3, 2, 8, 6, 14\n    * Right Structure: 2, 11, 1, 11\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:**  3, 2, 8, 6, 14, 2, 11, 1, 11\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nIt's crucial to build in layers, working from the bottom up, so as not to have blocks unsupported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 11\"\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order ensures that each block is placed on a stable, already-placed block.  Any other order would result in unstable structures that would collapse.\n"

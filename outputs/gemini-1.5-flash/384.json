            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the solution, following the specified steps:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 14 blocks.  It's not easily defined by layers due to the staggered nature of the build, but we can consider different sections.  The left section is approximately 3 \"layers\" high and the right section is 4.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two distinct sections.  The left section features a base of two arch blocks (index 2), supporting a column of blocks. The right section features a base of two arch blocks (index 2), supporting another column.  The columns feature a mix of rectangular and other shaped blocks.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need to identify the blocks in the target structure from the given dictionary.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**  Based on visual comparison:\n\n    * Two arch-shaped red blocks (Index 2)\n    * One blue cube (Index 6)\n    * Two orange rectangular blocks (Index 7)\n    * One green rectangular block (Index 8)\n    * Two yellow rectangular blocks (Index 9)\n    * One yellow rectangular block (Index 11)\n    * One yellow rectangular block (Index 13)\n    * One yellow quarter-cylinder block (Index 14)\n    * One orange triangular block (Index 15)\n    * One red rectangular block (Index 7)\n    * Two red arch-shaped blocks (Index 2)\n\n\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly to their appearance in the dictionary. No rotations are used.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:** This order is suggested and may have other valid solutions. It prioritizes bottom-up construction:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 8\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step13\": \"Move block with index 15\",\n  \"Step14\": \"Move block with index 7\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The assembly order provided is a suggestion.  There might be other equally valid sequences depending on the stability preferences during construction.  For example, the order of placing some blocks on top of each other could be reversed. However, the block indices and counts must remain the same.\n"

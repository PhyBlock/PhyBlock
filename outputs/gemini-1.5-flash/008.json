            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, following the specified steps:\n\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 6 blocks in total and has 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  The structure is essentially symmetrical. The base layer consists of two orange triangular prisms (pointing outwards) and two blue cubes positioned vertically between them and the middle layer. The middle layer comprises two orange cylindrical blocks placed one on top of the other. The top layer is a single orange triangular prism placed to fit snugly on top of the cylinders.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need to identify the blocks based on their shape, color, and orientation.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Two orange triangular prisms (pointing outwards): Index 12, 16\n    * Two blue cubes (vertical orientation): Index 1, 1\n    * Two orange cylinders (vertical orientation): Index 4, 4\n    * One orange triangular prism (pointing upwards): Index 8\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks match exactly from the dictionary image, in terms of shape, color and orientation.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nGiven the physical constraints of stacking, a reasonable assembly order would be:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 12\n  Step2: Move block with index 16\n  Step3: Move block with index 1\n  Step4: Move block with index 1\n  Step5: Move block with index 4\n  Step6: Move block with index 4\n  Step7: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n\nThis order allows for stable placement in each step.  Starting with the base triangular prisms (12 and 16) provides a foundation.  The next step includes placing the blue cubes (index 1), and then stacking the cylinders (index 4). Finally, the top triangle (index 8) is added.\n"

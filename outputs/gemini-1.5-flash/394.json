Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The target image shows a structure composed of 10 blocks.  The larger structure on the right has four layers, while the smaller structure on the left has two layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Left Structure (2 Layers):** Two identical red blocks (arch-shaped) are placed side-by-side forming the base. Two smaller red triangular blocks are placed on top, one on each arch.\n    * **Right Structure (4 Layers):**\n        * Base: A red block with a circular hole is at the bottom.\n        * Second Layer: A yellow block sits atop the central red block.\n        * Third Layer: A blue block and a green block are placed side by side on top of the yellow block.\n        * Fourth Layer: Two red triangular blocks form the top, one on each side of the blue/green blocks.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** To reconstruct the target structure, we need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n* **List of Block Indices:**\n    * Index 1 (red arch) x 2\n    * Index 13 (red triangle) x 2\n    * Index 1 (red arch) x 2\n    * Index 7 (red block)\n    * Index 8 (yellow block)\n    * Index 4 (blue block)\n    * Index 5 (green block)\n    * Index 14 (red triangle) x 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 1\nStep3: Move block with index 13\nStep4: Move block with index 13\nStep5: Move block with index 7\nStep6: Move block with index 8\nStep7: Move block with index 4\nStep8: Move block with index 5\nStep9: Move block with index 14\nStep10: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  The instruction set above prioritizes building the right structure first, then the left.  You could rearrange the steps to build the left structure first, but the blocks specified will remain the same.  It also assumes that placement is done in a way that allows for block stability.  For example, step 3 and 4 would likely occur after step 1 and 2 are securely placed. The same goes for steps 9 and 10.  A real-world construction would require more nuanced instructions.\n"

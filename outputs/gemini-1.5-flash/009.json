Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 6 blocks in total, arranged in 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Base Layer:** Two orange triangular prisms (pointing outwards) are placed symmetrically on either side of the central vertical axis.\n    * **Middle Layer:** A vertical orange cylindrical block is placed in the center, directly above the space between the two triangular prisms. Two green rectangular blocks are placed vertically adjacent to the cylindrical block, one on each side.\n    * **Top Layer:** An orange triangular prism (pointing upwards) sits on top of the central cylindrical block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**\n    * Two orange triangular prisms (pointing outwards):  Index 13 and 16\n    * One orange cylindrical block (vertical orientation): Index 5\n    * Two green rectangular blocks (vertical orientation): Index 2 and 2 (or 1 and 1)\n    * One orange triangular prism (pointing upwards): Index 10\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 13, 16, 5, 2, 2, 10\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nA logical assembly order, ensuring stability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 16\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence places the base first, then the central column, followed by the side supports, and finally the top piece.  Other sequences are possible as long as they ensure a stable structure at each step.  For example, placing the green blocks before the central column could work if care is taken to ensure stability.\n"

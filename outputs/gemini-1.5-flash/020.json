Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks in total, arranged across roughly 3 layers (the base counts as one layer). The \"neck\" and \"head\" could be considered additional layers, depending on your interpretation.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**  The structure is built from the bottom up.\n    * The base consists of two red arch blocks (index 1 and 2).\n    * A yellow block (index 9) sits on top of the base, centered.\n    * A blue block (index 4) is placed on top of the yellow block.\n    * Another blue block (index 4) is placed to the left of the first blue block and on top of the yellow block.\n    * A green block (index 7) is positioned horizontally on top of the blue blocks.\n    * An orange triangular block (index 14) sits on top of the green block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  The image requires the following blocks based on their shape, color, and orientation:\n    * Two red arch blocks (index 1 and 2).\n    * One yellow block (index 9).\n    * Two blue blocks (index 4).\n    * One green block (index 7).\n    * One orange triangular block (index 14).\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [1, 2, 9, 4, 4, 7, 14]\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly needs to be done from the bottom up, stacking carefully to match the image.  It is likely easier to place blocks 1 and 2 first (the base).  Following the layers is the most straightforward approach.\n\n* **Assembly Instructions:**\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 9\nStep4: Move block with index 4\nStep5: Move block with index 4\nStep6: Move block with index 7\nStep7: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis order ensures that each block is placed on a stable base before adding the next, directly mirroring the structure in the target image.\n"

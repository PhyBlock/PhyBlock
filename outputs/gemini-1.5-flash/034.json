There are two vertical green blocks and two horizontal yellow blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** Two green blocks are vertically stacked in the center.  One yellow block is placed horizontally on top of the green blocks, and another yellow block sits horizontally at the bottom of the green blocks.\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** We need two green blocks oriented vertically and two yellow blocks oriented horizontally.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**  Indices 3 and 3 (or 4 and 4), and indices 7 and 7 (or 8 and 8) are needed.  It requires two identical blocks of each type.\n\n* **Matching Criteria:**  The chosen blocks precisely match the target image in shape, color, and orientation.\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The order of placing the two green blocks (step 1 and 2) is arbitrary, as is the order of placing the yellow blocks (step 3 and 4).  Both pairs must be placed to complete the structure as shown in the main target image.\n"

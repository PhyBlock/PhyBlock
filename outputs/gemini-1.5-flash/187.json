The larger structure on the left is essentially two layers and has more than 1 block in each layer. The smaller structure on the right has 2 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Left Structure:** A yellow rectangular block (horizontal) forms the base. Two green rectangular blocks (vertical) are placed on top of the yellow block, creating the central pillars. A yellow rectangular block (horizontal) sits on top of the green blocks, acting as a lintel.  Finally, an orange triangular block is placed on top of the yellow lintel to make a roof.\n\n    * **Right Structure:** Two orange cylindrical blocks form the base, placed side-by-side. A green rectangular block (horizontal) rests on top of the cylindrical blocks.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identified Needed Blocks:**  We need to match the blocks' shapes, colors, and orientations exactly as shown in the dictionary.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Left Structure: 5 (Yellow horizontal), 6 (Green vertical), 6 (Green vertical), 5 (Yellow horizontal), 14 (Orange triangular)\n    * Right Structure: 10 (Orange cylindrical), 10 (Orange cylindrical), 1 (Green horizontal)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to consider layering and stability.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 1\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  This assembly order prioritizes building the larger structure first, then the smaller one.  Other orders might be possible as long as they result in the same final structure and adhere to the layering constraints shown in the target image.  For example, the base blocks of the smaller structure could be placed before the larger structure.  But this would not be as efficient.\n"

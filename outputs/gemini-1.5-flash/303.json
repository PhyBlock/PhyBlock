The first structure has four blocks in three layers. The second structure has four blocks in two layers.  In total there are eight blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Left):**  A yellow block forms the base. A red block sits on top of the yellow block. A green block is placed on the red block, slightly offset to one side. A red block is placed on top of the green block.\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Right):** A blue block forms the base. Another blue block is placed next to the first, forming a base of two blocks. An orange block sits atop these. A green block is placed on top of the orange block, with its long side parallel to one side of the orange block. A top orange block is situated on top of the green block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need to match the blocks in size, shape, color, and orientation.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Structure 1: 5, 11, 9, 4\n    * Structure 2: 1, 1, 11, 7, 14\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly to their counterparts in the dictionary image with no rotations allowed.\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the spatial relationships, here's a possible assembly order.  Note that there are slightly different valid assembly orders for this.  The important part is that the blocks are placed in a manner to support the next block(s).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 4\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 11\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 14\"\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the left structure then the right structure, placing blocks from the bottom up.  Other orders that respect the constraints may also be valid.\n"

Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 10 blocks.  There are three distinct sections which could be considered separate layers, but the overall construction has a height of 5 blocks.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure consists of two separate constructions. The larger construction on the left is a tower-like structure. At its base are two red arch blocks (2) placed side-by-side. Above these, a single red block (6) sits centrally.  A green block (10) is stacked on top, and then the final two blocks -  a yellow block (7) and a peaked orange roof block (14) are stacked on top.  The smaller construction on the right is a simple house: it has a red block (6) as the base, topped by a green block (9) and a peaked orange roof block (15).\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:** To construct the target structure, the following blocks are needed:\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Block 2 (red arch) x2\n    * Block 6 (red cube) x2\n    * Block 7 (yellow cube) x1\n    * Block 9 (green cube) x1\n    * Block 10 (green block) x1\n    * Block 14 (orange peak) x1\n    * Block 15 (orange peak) x1\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should reflect building the structure from the bottom up.  Because there are two distinct constructions, it's better to build one complete structure before moving to the other.\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 2\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 6\nStep4: Move block with index 10\nStep5: Move block with index 7\nStep6: Move block with index 14\nStep7: Move block with index 6\nStep8: Move block with index 9\nStep9: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis order builds the larger structure first (steps 1-6), then the smaller structure (steps 7-9).  The blocks are placed in the correct orientation and position according to the main target image and the block dictionary.\n"

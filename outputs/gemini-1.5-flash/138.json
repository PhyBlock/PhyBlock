            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The structure uses 12 blocks.  It has three main layers, but some blocks extend above the main layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is built around a central bridge-like arch (blocks 2 and its mirror).  The tallest towers are on either side of the central arch. A smaller green block sits atop one tower. Smaller blocks fill out spaces to complete the structure. The blocks at the very top are slightly offset from each other.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  Based on the image, we need specific shapes, colors and rotations.\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n    * Two arch blocks: index 2 (and its mirror)\n    * Blue block: index 5\n    * Green block: index 6\n    * Orange block (tall): index 7 (x2)\n    * Orange block (sloped): index 14 (x2)\n    * Yellow block: index 10 (x2)\n    * Yellow block (small arch): index 13\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should follow a bottom-up approach, prioritizing stability.  It's hard to give a completely precise order without knowing the precise dimensions and potential interlocking capabilities of the blocks, but a logical sequence is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 2 (mirror image)\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 14\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 5\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 10\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**  The \"mirror image\" of block index 2 is assumed to be implicitly understood, as block 2 is a symmetrical arch. There is no index in the block dictionary for the mirrored version of index 2. This assumption is made based on the visual appearance of the target image.  A true solution might require a more extensive block dictionary or a notation to indicate the mirrored image of a block.\n\nThis assembly order prioritizes building the base and central arch first, followed by the towers and their capstones. The small yellow arch-shaped block might be placed in more than one position to meet structural stability criteria.  This step-by-step process is a plausible reconstruction but might need minor adjustments depending on the exact physical properties of the blocks.\n"

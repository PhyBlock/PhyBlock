It has a maximum of 3 layers in certain areas.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The structure is composed of two distinct sections connected. The first section (left) features two arches (block 2) side-by-side forming the base, with three vertical rectangular blocks (block 12, 12, 12) above them, and a smaller green block (block 9) sitting on top of the central column.  The second section (right) also uses two arches (block 2) as a base, with a cube (block 4) placed centrally above the arches. On top of the cube sit  a smaller blue block (block 4), a smaller green block (block 7), and a slanted orange block (block 14) completes the structure.  The placement of the blocks indicates each layer must be placed before the blocks above.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  The blocks needed are in the dictionary.\n\n* **List Block Indices:** The required block indices are: 2, 2, 12, 12, 12, 9, 2, 2, 4, 4, 7, 14\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched based on shape, color, and orientation as presented in the dictionary image.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**  The order is based on a layer-by-layer and left-to-right approach. This is an inference, as many sequences might work.\n\n```\n{\nStep 1: Move block with index 2\nStep 2: Move block with index 2\nStep 3: Move block with index 12\nStep 4: Move block with index 12\nStep 5: Move block with index 12\nStep 6: Move block with index 9\nStep 7: Move block with index 2\nStep 8: Move block with index 2\nStep 9: Move block with index 4\nStep 10: Move block with index 4\nStep 11: Move block with index 7\nStep 12: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

The left structure has 4 blocks and 2 layers. The right structure has 5 blocks and 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Left Structure):**\n    * A yellow horizontal block forms the outer frame on the left and right.\n    * A green block is vertically placed between the yellow blocks in the lower half.\n    * A red block is vertically placed, nested on top of the green block.\n    * A blue block sits on top of the green block, but slightly to the left of the red block.\n\n\n* **Spatial Relationships (Right Structure):**\n    * An orange triangular block forms the roof.\n    * A blue block is placed centrally underneath the roof.\n    * An orange block sits below the blue block, centered.\n    * A green block is placed to the left of the orange block.\n    * An orange block is placed to the right of the orange block (below the blue block).\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Left Structure:**\n    * Yellow Horizontal Block: Index 11\n    * Yellow Horizontal Block: Index 11\n    * Green Vertical Block: Index 10\n    * Red Vertical Block: Index 4\n    * Blue Block: Index 1\n\n* **Right Structure:**\n    * Orange Triangular Block: Index 15\n    * Blue Block: Index 1\n    * Orange Block: Index 3\n    * Green Block: Index 2\n    * Orange Block: Index 3\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is based on which blocks need to be in place first to build up and support other blocks. It's somewhat ambiguous for the 2nd structure which could be assembled in multiple ways.  I am choosing a likely build sequence which is bottom to top and left to right, for ease of instruction.\n\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11 (Yellow horizontal base left)\n    Step2: Move block with index 11 (Yellow horizontal base right)\n    Step3: Move block with index 10 (Green vertical)\n    Step4: Move block with index 4 (Red vertical)\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (Blue)\n\n    Step6: Move block with index 3 (Orange block- bottom- left)\n    Step7: Move block with index 2 (Green block- bottom)\n    Step8: Move block with index 3 (Orange block-bottom-right)\n    Step9: Move block with index 1 (Blue Block)\n    Step10: Move block with index 15 (Orange triangular roof)\n}\n\n"

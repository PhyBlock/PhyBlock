Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The main image shows a structure composed of 8 blocks. The taller structure on the left has three layers. The shorter structure on the right has two layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Left Structure:** A green block (two vertical pieces) forms the base. A yellow block rests atop the green, spanning both green parts. An orange cylindrical block sits on top of the yellow block, and a yellow quarter-cylinder block is placed on the very top.\n    * **Right Structure:** Two red blocks with arch shapes form the base, creating a space in between. A yellow block with an arch shape is placed atop the red ones, and a yellow quarter-cylinder is on top of this.\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks:** Based on the visual analysis:\n    * Left Structure:  Blocks 5, 9, 11, 13\n    * Right Structure: Blocks 2, 2, 10, 16\n\n* **List Block Indices:** [5, 9, 11, 13, 2, 2, 10, 16]\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are selected to precisely match the shape, color, and orientation presented in the target image and the block dictionary.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order should be bottom-up for each structure, then combined.  We can't realistically 'move' the blocks, so each step will be to place a block in a specific location to build the structures.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Place block with index 5 (green double-upright)\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Place block with index 2 (red arch) on the left\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Place block with index 2 (red arch) on the right\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Place block with index 9 (yellow horizontal) on top of block 5\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Place block with index 10 (yellow horizontal) on top of blocks 2 and 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Place block with index 11 (orange cylinder) on top of block 9\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Place block with index 16 (yellow quarter-cylinder) on top of block 11\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Place block with index 13 (yellow quarter-cylinder) on top of block 10\"\n}\n```\n"

The larger structure has 4 layers at its tallest point, while the smaller structure (house) has 3 layers.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:** The image depicts two separate structures.\n\n    * **Structure 1 (Larger Structure):**  This structure is built from the bottom up. The base consists of two arch-shaped blocks (red) side-by-side.  On top of these, a yellow block is placed centrally.  Above that, two blue blocks sit side-by-side.  The top layer features a green block positioned horizontally on top of the blue blocks, with an orange triangular block on its right side.\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Smaller Structure):** This is a small house-like structure.  The base is a red block, topped by a green block, and finally an orange triangular block.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  To match the main image perfectly, we need the blocks listed below, maintaining their precise orientation.\n\n\n* **List Block Indices:**\n\n    * Structure 1: 1, 2, 6, 3, 3, 8, 11, 14\n    * Structure 2: 5, 7, 14\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThis assembly order prioritizes building the larger structure first, then the smaller one.  It's organized in a bottom-up fashion for each structure.\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 3\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 11\n   Step8: Move block with index 14\n   Step9: Move block with index 5\n   Step10: Move block with index 7\n   Step11: Move block with index 14\n}\n\n"

            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task based on the provided images:\n\n**1. Analyze and Describe the Main Target Image:**\n\n* **Count & Layers:** The image shows two structures.  The first is a small house-like structure with 4 blocks and 2 layers. The second is a giraffe-like structure with 6 blocks and 3 layers (not including the head).\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    * **Structure 1 (House):** A red arched block forms the base.  On top of this, a green block sits.  A blue block is placed on top of the green block. Finally, a red triangular roof block is placed on top of the blue block.\n\n    * **Structure 2 (Giraffe):** Two green vertical blocks form the legs. A yellow block sits horizontally above, joining the legs. A red block is above the yellow block. A blue block is stacked on the red block. Finally, a yellow semi-circular block tops it all.\n\n\n**2. Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Needed Blocks & Indices:**\n\n    * Structure 1:\n        * Block 1 (red arched block)\n        * Block 4 (green block)\n        * Block 3 (blue block)\n        * Block 15 (red triangular block)\n\n    * Structure 2:\n        * Block 4 (green block) x2\n        * Block 9 (yellow block)\n        * Block 5 (red block)\n        * Block 3 (blue block)\n        * Block 11 (yellow semi-circular block)\n\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order needs to be done separately for each structure.  The blocks must be stacked as shown in the target image.\n\n\n* **Structure 1 Assembly:**\n    ```\n    {\n       Step1: Move block with index 1\n       Step2: Move block with index 4\n       Step3: Move block with index 3\n       Step4: Move block with index 15\n    }\n    ```\n\n* **Structure 2 Assembly:**\n    ```\n    {\n       Step1: Move block with index 4\n       Step2: Move block with index 4\n       Step3: Move block with index 9\n       Step4: Move block with index 5\n       Step5: Move block with index 3\n       Step6: Move block with index 11\n    }\n    ```\n\nThe overall assembly process would involve first building structure 1 according to the first set of instructions, and then structure 2 according to the second set of instructions.\n"

It has 3 distinct layers in the main structure, and a single block sits separately.\n\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * Layer 1 (Base): Three identical red arch-shaped blocks (index 3) are placed side-by-side.\n    * Layer 2 (Middle): A blue cube (index 9) rests on top of the center red arch.\n    * Layer 3 (Top): A red block with two archways (index 2) sits on top of the Layer 1.  A yellow block (index 13) is placed on top of this. Another yellow block (index 13) sits on top of the base at the right-hand side.\n\n\n\n2. **Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n* **Identify Needed Blocks:**  We need three red arch blocks, one blue cube, one red block with two archways, and two yellow blocks.\n\n* **List Block Indices:** 3, 3, 3, 9, 2, 13, 13\n\n* **Matching Criteria:** All blocks are matched exactly to their shape, color, and orientation as they appear in the provided dictionary.\n\n\n3. **Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 3\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 2\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 13\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 13\"\n}\n```\n\nThe step-by-step instructions assume that the placement of the blocks is from left-to-right and from bottom-to-top, and that blocks 3 are placed first from the left.  Additional instructions specifying precise placement could be added for complete clarity.\n"

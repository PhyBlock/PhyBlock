Let's break down each part:\n\n#### Left Structure:\n- **Base Layer:**\n  - One red arch block in the center.\n  - Two orange cylinders on either side of the arch.\n\n- **Middle Layer:**\n  - Two green rectangular blocks, one on each side of the arch and cylinder assembly.\n  - Two orange wedges (triangular prisms) in front of each green block.\n\n- **Top Layer:**\n  - One red block on top of the arch.\n\n#### Right Structure:\n- **Base Layer:**\n  - Two yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally, creating a frame at the top and bottom.\n  - Two green rectangular blocks placed vertically, aligning with the sides of the frame.\n\n- **Middle Layer:**\n  - One red square block on top of a blue block in the center, forming a middle column.\n\n### Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n1. **Red Arch Block** - Index 1\n2. **Orange Cylinder Block** - Index 11 (two needed)\n3. **Green Rectangular Block** - Index 8 (two needed)\n4. **Orange Wedge Block** - Index 14 (two needed)\n5. **Red Rectangular Block** - Index 3\n6. **Yellow Rectangular Block** - Index 10 (two needed)\n7. **Green Square Block** - Index 8 (two needed, same block used)\n8. **Red Square Block** - Index 5\n9. **Blue Square Block** - Index 4\n\n### Assembly Instructions:\n\n```plaintext\nStep 1: Move block with index 1 (red arch block) to center.\nStep 2: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder block) to left of arch.\nStep 3: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder block) to right of arch.\nStep 4: Move block with index 8 (green block) to left of left cylinder.\nStep 5: Move block with index 8 (green block) to right of right cylinder.\nStep 6: Move block with index 14 (orange wedge) to front of left green block.\nStep 7: Move block with index 14 (orange wedge) to front of right green block.\nStep 8: Move block with index 3 (red block) on top of red arch.\nStep 9: Move block with index 10 (yellow block) to bottom of right structure.\nStep 10: Move block with index 10 (yellow block) to top of right structure.\nStep 11: Move block with index 8 (green block) vertically on the left of right section.\nStep 12: Move block with index 8 (green block) vertically on the right of right section.\nStep 13: Move block with index 5 (red block) on top of blue block.\nStep 14: Move block with index 4 (blue block) below red block.\n```\n\nThis setup should replicate the target structure accurately.",

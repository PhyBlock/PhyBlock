Red blocks stacked vertically.\n  3. Blue block in the middle.\n  4. Yellow vertical block on the side.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships**:\n  - The base layer is a horizontal green block.\n  - Above it are two stacked red blocks.\n  - A blue block is sandwiched between two red blocks.\n  - A yellow block is vertically placed on the side.\n  - The top layer is another horizontal green block.\n\n### Structure on the Right:\n\n- **Layers Count**: 2 layers.\n- **Blocks Used**: \n  1. Two orange cylinders as pillars.\n  2. One green long block on top.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships**:\n  - Two orange cylinders are placed parallel at the base.\n  - A green block is placed horizontally on top like a bridge.\n\n## Block Selection from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Green Blocks**:\n  - Use index 5 for the horizontal orientation (3 needed).\n\n- **Red Blocks**:\n  - Use index 3 for the cubes in the vertical tower (2 needed).\n\n- **Blue Blocks**:\n  - Use index 1 for the cube.\n\n- **Yellow Blocks**:\n  - Use index 6 for the vertical orientation.\n\n- **Orange Cylinders**:\n  - Use index 14 for the vertical orientation (2 needed).\n\n## Assembly Order:\n\n```plaintext\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 5 (green horizontal)\n  Step2: Move block with index 3 (red cube)\n  Step3: Move block with index 1 (blue cube)\n  Step4: Move block with index 3 (red cube)\n  Step5: Move block with index 6 (yellow vertical)\n  Step6: Move block with index 5 (green horizontal)\n  Step7: Move block with index 14 (orange cylinder)\n  Step8: Move block with index 14 (orange cylinder)\n  Step9: Move block with index 5 (green horizontal)\n}\n```",

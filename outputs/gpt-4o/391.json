Letâ€™s analyze and recreate the structures shown in the main target image using the blocks from the dictionary image.\n\n### Main Target Image Analysis\n\n1. **Structure 1 - Train**\n   - **Base Layer**: \n     - Two orange cylindrical blocks (wheels).\n     - Two yellow rectangular blocks on top of wheels.\n   - **Second Layer**:\n     - One green block and one blue block on the left.\n     - One red block on the right.\n   - **Top Layer**:\n     - Two yellow curved blocks (forming a roof).\n\n2. **Structure 2 - Archway**\n   - **Base Layer**:\n     - Two red arch blocks.\n   - **Second Layer**:\n     - One horizontal yellow rectangular block.\n   - **Middle Layer**:\n     - Two red blocks with a circular cutout when joined.\n   - **Top Layer**:\n     - One long yellow rectangular block.\n\n### Block Selection from Dictionary\n\n- **Train**:\n  - Orange Cylinder (index 14) x2\n  - Yellow Rectangular Block (index 11) x2\n  - Green Block (index 6)\n  - Blue Block (index 5)\n  - Red Block (index 7)\n  - Yellow Curved Block (index 15) x2\n\n- **Archway**:\n  - Red Arch Block (index 1) x2\n  - Yellow Rectangular Block (index 11) x1\n  - Red Block with Cutout (index 3) x2 \n  - Long Yellow Block (index 10) x1\n\n### Assembly Instructions\n\n{\n   Step 1: Move block with index 14\n   Step 2: Move block with index 14\n   Step 3: Move block with index 11\n   Step 4: Move block with index 11\n   Step 5: Move block with index 6\n   Step 6: Move block with index 5\n   Step 7: Move block with index 7\n   Step 8: Move block with index 15\n   Step 9: Move block with index 15\n   Step 10: Move block with index 1\n   Step 11: Move block with index 1\n   Step 12: Move block with index 11\n   Step 13: Move block with index 3\n   Step 14: Move block with index 3\n   Step 15: Move block with index 10\n}\n\nThis should recreate the structures exactly as shown in the main target image using the blocks in their respective orientations.",

Move block with index 2 (Blue cube) to bottom left.\n2. Move block with index 2 (Blue cube) to bottom right.\n3. Move block with index 8 (Yellow rectangle) on top of bottom left blue cube.\n4. Move block with index 8 (Yellow rectangle) on top of right blue cube.\n5. Move block with index 1 (Red arch) on top of yellow blocks.\n6. Move block with index 14 (Red triangular roof) on top of red arch, left position.\n7. Move block with index 15 (Red triangular roof) on top of red arch, right position.\n\n#### Structure 2:\n1. Move block with index 11 (Orange cylinder) to bottom left.\n2. Move block with index 11 (Orange cylinder) to bottom right.\n3. Move block with index 8 (Yellow rectangle) over bottom left orange cylinder.\n4. Move block with index 8 (Yellow rectangle) over right orange cylinder.\n5. Move block with index 6 (Blue cube) on top of left yellow rectangle.\n6. Move block with index 5 (Red cube) next to blue cube on the yellow rectangle. \n\nThis systematic approach ensures the structures match those depicted in the main target image.",

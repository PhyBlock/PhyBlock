The structure naturally divides into a left “archway” group (11 pieces) and a right “ring” group (6 pieces), for a total of 17 blocks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF THE TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────\n■ Overall Count and Layers\n\n● LEFT “ARCHWAY” (11 blocks in about 5 vertical layers):\n  – Bottom layer:  \n    1) One orange wedge at far left  \n    2) One orange wedge at far right  \n    3) One orange cylinder (left column)  \n    4) One orange cylinder (right column)  \n    5) One tall green rectangular block behind the left cylinder  \n    6) One tall green rectangular block behind the right cylinder  \n  – Second layer:  \n    7) Small orange rectangular/cube block atop the left cylinder  \n    8) Small orange rectangular/cube block atop the right cylinder  \n  – Third layer:  \n    9) Red arch bridging the two small orange blocks  \n  – Fourth layer:  \n    10) Red rectangular block sitting on top of that arch (the circular cut‐out on its front/back is simply not visible from this camera angle)  \n  – Fifth/top layer:  \n    11) An orange wedge forming the “roof” at the apex  \n\n● RIGHT “RING” (6 blocks in about 2 layers):\n  – Main “ring” frame (4 red blocks):  \n    1) Red arch at the top  \n    2) Red arch at the bottom  \n    3) Red “C‐cut” block on the left side  \n    4) Red “C‐cut” block on the right side  \n    (Arranged so that their circular cutouts form one large ring/circle.)\n  – Center region:  \n    5) One green rectangular block spanning horizontally across the ring’s center  \n    6) One blue cube in the very middle  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  MAPPING TO THE DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is which dictionary‐index each visible piece corresponds to.  Note that no rotations other than the exact pose in the dictionary are used; the “hidden” cutouts of the red blocks (#3) simply face away from the camera.\n\n• Red arch  (#1) used 3 times total  \n  – 1× bridging the cylinders on the left  \n  – 2× forming top and bottom of the ring on the right  \n\n• Red “C‐cut” block  (#3) used 3 times  \n  – 1× as the rectangular red piece atop the left arch  \n  – 2× as the left and right sides of the ring on the right  \n\n• Blue cube  (#4) used once (center of the ring)\n\n• Green rectangular block  (#7) used once (horizontal “belt” through the ring on the right)\n\n• Green tall rectangular block  (#8) used twice (each behind the orange columns on the left)\n\n• Orange cylinder  (#10) used twice (the two columns on the left)\n\n• Orange small rectangular/cube block  (#12) used twice (one atop each cylinder on the left)\n\n• Orange wedge blocks (#13, #14, #15) each used once  \n  – Two form the lower left and lower right wedges on the left base  \n  – One serves as the small “roof” wedge at the top  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY SEQUENCE\n────────────────────────────────────────\nHere is one possible building order, from ground‐up:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 13,\n  Step2:  Move block with index 14,\n  Step3:  Move block with index 10,\n  Step4:  Move block with index 10,\n  Step5:  Move block with index 8,\n  Step6:  Move block with index 8,\n  Step7:  Move block with index 12,\n  Step8:  Move block with index 12,\n  Step9:  Move block with index 1,\n  Step10: Move block with index 3,\n  Step11: Move block with index 15,\n  Step12: Move block with index 1,\n  Step13: Move block with index 1,\n  Step14: Move block with index 3,\n  Step15: Move block with index 3,\n  Step16: Move block with index 7,\n  Step17: Move block with index 4\n}\n\nSteps 1–11 complete the left archway (wedges, cylinders, arch, top block, roof wedge).  \nSteps 12–17 assemble the ring on the right (two arches #1 for top/bottom, two “C‐cut” blocks #3 for sides, the green rectangle #7, then the blue cube #4 last).",

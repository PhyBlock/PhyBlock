The bottom (first) layer has two red arch‐shaped blocks set at right angles to each other, and the top (second) layer consists of two orange wedge blocks forming the “roof.”  \n\n• Spatial Relationships  \n1) On the ground layer, one red arch faces “front to back” while the other arch sits behind it turned 90 degrees (so its arch runs “side to side”). Pushed snugly together, their top surfaces create a flat platform.  \n2) On the second (upper) layer, two orange triangular wedges rest side by side on that flat platform, pitched toward each other so that their hypotenuses meet in the middle, forming a ridged roof.  \n\nSelecting the Required Blocks  \nFrom the Dictionary image, the matching shapes and orientations are:  \n• Red arch that opens “front to back”: Index 1  \n• Red arch that opens “side to side”: Index 2  \n• Left‐sloping orange roof wedge: Index 11  \n• Right‐sloping orange roof wedge (mirror): Index 12  \n\nAssembly Order  \nBelow is a simple step‐by‐step assembly sequence using those exact dictionary blocks (no extra rotation needed):\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1   // Place the front‐to‐back arch\n  Step2: Move block with index 2   // Place the side‐to‐side arch behind it\n  Step3: Move block with index 11  // Place the left‐sloping orange wedge on top\n  Step4: Move block with index 12  // Place the right‐sloping orange wedge next to it\n}",

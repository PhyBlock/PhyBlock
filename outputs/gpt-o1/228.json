        "content": "STEP 1:  ANALYZE AND DESCRIBE THE TARGET\n\nThere are in fact two separate “towers” (a smaller one on the left and a larger one on the right).  In total they use 16 blocks, arranged as follows:\n\n● Left‐Hand Structure (6 blocks)\n  – Shape/Layering:\n    1) Two tall green pillars at left and right.  \n    2) A long yellow bar across the top and another yellow bar across the bottom, forming a rectangular “frame.”  \n    3) In the center of that frame, one red cube stacked on top of one blue cube.\n  – Hence it is essentially five “bars/pillars” forming a rectangle, plus two small cubes in the middle.\n\n● Right‐Hand Structure (10 blocks)\n  – Bottom Layer:\n    1) A green rectangular block laid horizontally as the base.  \n    2) An orange cylinder rising vertically from that base.  \n    3) A wide yellow bar placed horizontally above the cylinder (this is the “bottom bar” of the large square frame).\n  – Middle Frame:\n    4) Two tall green pillars standing vertically on either side.  \n    5) A second wide yellow rectangular bar across their tops (the “top bar”).  \n    6) An orange triangular wedge set into the middle opening (facing outward under that top bar).\n  – Top Layers:\n    7) Another green rectangular block laid horizontally atop the frame.  \n    8) A small blue block sitting on that green block.  \n    9) A final orange wedge forming a “roof” on top of the blue block.\n\nSTEP 2:  SELECT THE REQUIRED BLOCKS\n\nYou will need the following Dictionary indices (re‐using blocks as indicated):\n\n• #1  (blue cube) – 2 total  \n• #3  (red cube) – 1 total  \n• #7  (green rectangular block, horizontal) – 2 total  \n• #9  (green rectangular block, vertical/tall) – 4 total  \n• #10 (yellow rectangular block, horizontal) – 4 total  \n• #12 (orange cylinder, vertical) – 1 total  \n• #16 (orange triangular wedge) – 2 total  \n\nSTEP 3:  DETERMINE AN ASSEMBLY ORDER\n\nA convenient bottom‐to‐top building sequence is (block indices in braces):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 9   (left green pillar of the small, left structure)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 9   (right green pillar of the small, left structure)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 10  (bottom yellow bar, left structure)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 1   (blue cube in center, left structure)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 3   (red cube on top of blue, left structure)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 10  (top yellow bar, left structure)  \n\n  Step7:  Move block with index 7   (green horizontal base, right structure)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 12  (orange cylinder, standing vertically)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 10  (bottom yellow bar of the tall “window,” right structure)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 9   (left green pillar, right structure)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 9   (right green pillar, right structure)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 16  (orange wedge inside the window)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 10  (top yellow bar of the window)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 7   (green block on top)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 1   (blue cube atop the green block)  \n  Step16: Move block with index 16  (final orange wedge on top)\n}",

        "content": "Analysis of the Target Image  \n•  Overall there are two separate sub‐structures:  \n  1) A “table‐like” structure on the left, composed of four orange cylinders (forming pillars) and three green rectangular blocks laid flat on top as the “tabletop.”  \n  2) A “frame with a circular opening” on the right.  The circular opening is formed by four red arc‐blocks (one for each quarter of the circle).  Flanking that ring are two tall green blocks (left and right), and on the very top and bottom are two long yellow blocks.  \n\n•  Layering and Counts:  \n  –  Left Sub‐Structure:  \n     –  Bottom Layer: Four vertical orange cylinders.  \n     –  Top Layer: Three green rectangular blocks side‐by‐side.  \n     –  Total blocks on the left: 7.  \n  –  Right Sub‐Structure:  \n     –  Center: Four red arc‐blocks that combine into a circular hole (one arc each for top, bottom, left, right).  \n     –  Left/Right Sides: Two tall green rectangular prisms.  \n     –  Top/Bottom: Two yellow rectangular blocks.  \n     –  Total blocks on the right: 8.  \n  –  Grand total: 15 blocks.  \n\nSelection of Dictionary Blocks  \nBelow are the exact block indices (with their given orientations) that match the Target Image:  \n•  Orange cylinders (vertical pillars on the left): index 15 → 4 copies  \n•  Green flat rectangular blocks (tabletop on the left): index 7 → 3 copies  \n•  Red arc‐blocks (forming the circular hole on the right): one each of indices 1, 2, 5, 6  \n•  Tall green side‐blocks (right structure flanking the ring): index 10 → 2 copies  \n•  Yellow top/bottom planks (right structure frame): index 13 → 2 copies  \n\nAssembly Order  \nUse the following step‐by‐step placement (the “Move block with index…” statements), for example:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 15\n  Step2: Move block with index 15\n  Step3: Move block with index 15\n  Step4: Move block with index 15\n  Step5: Move block with index 7\n  Step6: Move block with index 7\n  Step7: Move block with index 7\n  Step8: Move block with index 1\n  Step9: Move block with index 2\n  Step10: Move block with index 5\n  Step11: Move block with index 6\n  Step12: Move block with index 10\n  Step13: Move block with index 10\n  Step14: Move block with index 13\n  Step15: Move block with index 13\n}",

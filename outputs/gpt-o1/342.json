You may of course vary the exact order, but typically one builds from the bottom up:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 13  \n  Step2: Move block with index 13  \n  Step3: Move block with index 13  \n  Step4: Move block with index 13  \n  Step5: Move block with index 13  \n  Step6: Move block with index 1  \n  Step7: Move block with index 1  \n  Step8: Move block with index 1  \n  Step9: Move block with index 1  \n  Step10: Move block with index 7  \n  Step11: Move block with index 3  \n  Step12: Move block with index 3  \n  Step13: Move block with index 7  \n}\n\nThis completes the structure exactly as shown in the target image.",

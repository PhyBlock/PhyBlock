Bottom (Layer 1): One red arch block.  \n     2. Layer 2: One small green rectangular block.  \n     3. Layer 3: One longer yellow rectangular block.  \n     4. Top (Layer 4): Two orange triangular wedges placed side by side to form a roof.\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**  \n   - **Layer 1 (Red Arch):** Sits on the ground with its arch opening facing the front.  \n   - **Layer 2 (Green Block):** Centered on top of the red arch.  \n   - **Layer 3 (Yellow Block):** Spans horizontally across the green block.  \n   - **Layer 4 (Orange Wedges):** Two triangular wedges meet in the middle on top of the yellow block, forming a peaked roof.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\n- **Red Arch (base):** Block #2  \n  - This is the red arch oriented front‐to‐back, matching the main image’s arch opening facing forward.  \n- **Green Rectangular Block:** Block #5  \n  - A low, rectangular green piece oriented horizontally.  \n- **Yellow Rectangular Block:** Block #8  \n  - A longer yellow beam oriented horizontally (as shown in the target).  \n- **Orange “Roof” Wedges:** Blocks #13 and #16  \n  - These two orange wedges, in their given orientations, form the left and right halves of the roof without needing rotation.\n\nHence the indices needed (in the exact orientations pictured) are:  \n{2, 5, 8, 13, 16}.\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is a simple bottom‐to‐top construction sequence. Use the following JSON‐like format:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2,\n  Step2: Move block with index 5,\n  Step3: Move block with index 8,\n  Step4: Move block with index 13,\n  Step5: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nExplanation of Steps:  \n1. Place the red arch block (#2) on the ground.  \n2. Stack the green rectangular block (#5) on top of the arch.  \n3. Place the yellow beam (#8) across the green block.  \n4. Position the first orange wedge (#13) on the left side to form half of the roof.  \n5. Finally, position the second orange wedge (#16) on the right side to complete the roof.",

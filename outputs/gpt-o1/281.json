        "content": "Below is one worked‐through “engineering” solution showing how one can account for (and then build) the two towers exactly as pictured, using only the unrotated blocks from the dictionary.  The explanation is in three parts:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)  OVERVIEW OF THE TARGET (BLOCK COUNT, LAYERS, AND ARRANGEMENT)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n■ Left “Triangle” Tower\n • Built in two main tiers (layers).  \n • Bottom Tier (five blocks):  \n   –  A large circular arch in the center (made by placing two red “C‐shaped” blocks face‐to‐face).  \n   –  One orange triangular wedge on the far left and one on the far right (both oriented so their sloped faces form the slant of the “triangle”).  \n   –  Two small cubes (one yellow, one red) “filling in” at the base to complete the horizontal row.  \n\n • Top Tier (three blocks):  \n   –  A green cube stacked directly above the arch on one side, and a blue cube above it on the other side.  \n   –  Capped by one orange wedge “roof” centered atop the blue and green cubes.  \n\n■ Right “Column” Tower\n • Built in three main tiers (layers), plus a wedge roof on top.  \n • Bottom Tier (two red arch blocks side by side)  \n   –  Each is the red block that has a semicircular opening on the underside.  \n • Middle Tier (three red arches plus two green pillars)  \n   –  One more arch block (red) sits in the center above the bottom two; flanking it left and right are two tall green rectangular prisms acting as columns.  \n –  Another pair of red arches (side by side) forms the square “platform” just below the green pillars.  \n • Upper Tier (one yellow bar and one orange wedge)  \n   –  A flat yellow rectangular block spans across the tops of the two green pillars.  \n   –  Finally, a single orange triangular wedge sits at the very top as the “roof.”  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2)  WHICH DICTIONARY BLOCKS ARE USED (AND HOW MANY OF EACH)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is a list of each dictionary‐index block needed.  Importantly, none are rotated differently than shown in the dictionary images.\n\n– Red “C‐shaped” arch (Block 3): 2 pieces  \n   (Used face‐to‐face to form the large circular opening in the left tower.)  \n\n– Red arch with semicircle underneath (Block 1): 6 pieces  \n   (Five go into the right‐tower’s arches: two on the bottom row, two forming the “platform,” one in the middle row; plus one extra red arch in the left base.)  \n\n– Red cube (Block 6): 1 piece  \n   (Sits in the bottom row of the left tower.)  \n\n– Blue cube (Block 4): 1 piece  \n   (Top tier of the left tower.)  \n\n– Green cube (Block 5): 1 piece  \n   (Top tier of the left tower, next to the blue cube.)  \n\n– Tall green rectangular prism (Block 10): 2 pieces  \n   (These are the two “columns” in the right tower.)  \n\n– Yellow cube (Block 7): 1 piece  \n   (Bottom‐row filler on the left tower.)  \n\n– Long yellow rectangular block (Block 11): 1 piece  \n   (Spans the tops of the green columns in the right tower.)  \n\n– Orange triangular wedges (Blocks 13–16): 4 pieces total  \n   (Three go into the left tower—two on the bottom corners, one as the “roof;” one goes on top of the right tower as its “roof.”  Each wedge is chosen from 13–16 so that its slope matches what is shown, without re‐orienting the block.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY SEQUENCE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA possible build order (from bottom to top and left tower first) is shown below.  \nSimply replace {idx} with the actual chosen index (for example, 13 or 14) for each orange wedge, depending on which orientation matches the picture.  \n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 3    (first half of the red circular arch in left tower)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 3    (second half, completing the circle)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 1    (red arch used at left base)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 6    (red cube to fill out the bottom row)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 7    (yellow cube at bottom row, right side)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 13   (orange wedge at bottom left corner)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 14   (orange wedge at bottom right corner)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 5    (green cube on second layer, left tower)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 4    (blue cube on second layer, left tower)\n  Step10: Move block with index 15   (orange wedge roof atop left tower)\n\n  -- now the right tower --\n  Step11: Move block with index 1    (first red arch in bottom row)\n  Step12: Move block with index 1    (second red arch in bottom row)\n  Step13: Move block with index 1    (red arch in middle row, center)\n  Step14: Move block with index 1    (arch #1 as part of the square “platform”)\n  Step15: Move block with index 1    (another arch #1 completing that platform)\n  Step16: Move block with index 10   (first tall green pillar)\n  Step17: Move block with index 10   (second tall green pillar)\n  Step18: Move block with index 11   (long yellow block spanning the pillars)\n  Step19: Move block with index 16   (final orange wedge roof on right tower)\n}\n\nBy selecting exactly the shapes/orientations from the dictionary (and not re‐rotating them), and then placing them in the above sequence, you will reproduce the two towers exactly as shown in the target image.",

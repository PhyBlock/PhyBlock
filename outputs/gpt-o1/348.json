        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can reproduce both groupings of blocks in the target image using only the shapes/orientations provided in the “dictionary” image (no re‐orientations allowed).  The explanation is in three parts: (1) a description of what is seen in the target image, (2) which dictionary blocks (by index) are selected to match each piece exactly (including orientation), and (3) a possible step‐by‐step assembly order.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  There are two separate “structures” in the scene (left and right).\n•  Total Block Count:  14 pieces.\n   – Left Structure uses 6 blocks.\n   – Right Structure uses 8 blocks.\n•  Left Structure (looks like a small “house”):\n   – Bottom Layer: \n       ◦ Two large blue blocks (one on the far left, one on the far right).  \n       ◦ One red rectangular‐looking block front‐center.\n       ◦ One green rectangular/cube‐looking block back‐center.\n   – Middle Layer:\n       ◦ A long yellow rectangular block spanning left to right across the top of the bottom blocks.\n   – Top Layer:\n       ◦ An orange wedge/triangular block sitting atop the yellow block like a roof.\n•  Right Structure (taller, mostly orange “columns”):\n   – Central Columns:\n       ◦ Three upright orange cylinders standing side by side.  \n       ◦ A larger orange wedge block perched on top of those cylinders.  \n   – On Each Side of the Cylinders:\n       ◦ A small blue rectangular/cube‐looking piece on the ground.\n       ◦ An orange wedge/triangular block adjacent to (or partially atop) each blue piece.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING THE DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow are the dictionary blocks that match each colored piece in both structures (in the exact orientations shown in the dictionary image).  Note that the same index can appear multiple times if needed.\n\nA)  Left Structure (6 blocks total)\n •  Blue side blocks:  Both are “blue rectangular blocks” #6 used in the same orientation as shown.  \n •  Red center block:  Chosen as the red “arch” #1, oriented so that the arch opening is hidden behind, presenting a rectangular face from the front.  \n •  Green center block:  The green cube #5.  \n •  Yellow long block across the top:  The yellow “flat rectangular” #7 (its longer dimension runs left–right, matching the target).  \n •  Orange wedge roof:  The orange wedge #15 (oriented with its triangular face “up,” as visible in the target).\n\nB)  Right Structure (8 blocks total)\n •  Three upright orange cylinders:  All are #10 (the orange cylinder standing on its circular base).  \n •  Two blue blocks (one on each side):  #6 again (same horizontal‐block orientation).  \n •  Three orange wedges:\n     – One wedge on top of the cylinders (chosen here as #15, same “triangle‐up” look).  \n     – One wedge by the left blue block (#14).  \n     – One wedge by the right blue block (#16).  \n       (These three wedge indices (#14, #15, #16) differ only by their exact rotation as shown in the dictionary, so each side wedge can be matched precisely.)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  PROPOSED ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one natural way to build from the bottom up.  Simply list each “move” in order, specifying which dictionary‐index block is placed:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 6       // Left‐structure blue (left side)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 6       // Left‐structure blue (right side)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 1       // Left‐structure red arch\n  Step4:  Move block with index 5       // Left‐structure green cube\n  Step5:  Move block with index 7       // Left‐structure yellow bar\n  Step6:  Move block with index 15      // Left‐structure orange wedge (roof)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 10      // Right‐structure first orange cylinder\n  Step8:  Move block with index 10      // Right‐structure second orange cylinder\n  Step9:  Move block with index 10      // Right‐structure third orange cylinder\n  Step10: Move block with index 6       // Right‐structure blue block (left side)\n  Step11: Move block with index 14      // Right‐structure orange wedge by left block\n  Step12: Move block with index 6       // Right‐structure blue block (right side)\n  Step13: Move block with index 16      // Right‐structure orange wedge by right block\n  Step14: Move block with index 15      // Right‐structure top wedge on cylinders\n}\n\nFollowing the above order places all 14 blocks in a bottom‐to‐top fashion and yields the same layout seen in the target image.",

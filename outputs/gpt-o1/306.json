        "content": "Below is one worked‐through solution that matches the two assembled “tower” and “animal‐like” figures exactly as shown, without re‐orienting any of the Dictionary blocks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  Overall there are two separate builds:\n\n  A)  Left “Animal‐like” Figure (8 blocks total):\n     –  Bottom layer is a short yellow block supporting\n        a red “cradle” block.  \n     –  Above the red cradle sits one small green block.\n     –  Two blue cubes sit side by side on top, forming\n        a “head” or “ears.”  \n     –  Off to one side of the red block are another short\n        yellow block plus two orange triangular wedges\n        arranged like “wings” or fins.\n  \n  B)  Right “Tower” (8 blocks total):\n     –  Bottom layer is a short yellow block (horizontal).\n     –  Two red ring‐blocks are stacked to create a tall\n        circular window in the center.\n     –  Another short yellow block spans the top of those\n        red rings as a “platform.”\n     –  Two tall green pillars sit on that platform.\n     –  A third short yellow block bridges across the\n        tops of the green pillars.\n     –  Finally, an orange triangular wedge perches on\n        top as a roof.\n\n•  Layer/Block Count:\n  –  Left structure uses 8 blocks in about four layers.\n  –  Right structure uses 8 blocks in about four layers.\n  –  In total, 16 blocks are visible.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMatching each shape/color/orientation exactly (no rotation):\n\nLEFT “ANIMAL‐LIKE” FIGURE (8 blocks)  \n  •  1 × #8  (yellow, short rectangular) as the base  \n  •  1 × #2  (red cradle‐shaped block)  \n  •  1 × #6  (green, small rectangular)  \n  •  2 × #4  (blue cubes)  \n  •  1 × #8  (another yellow, short rectangular)  \n  •  1 × #13 (orange triangular wedge)  \n  •  1 × #14 (orange triangular wedge)\n\nRIGHT “TOWER” (8 blocks)  \n  •  1 × #8  (yellow, short rectangular) for the bottom  \n  •  2 × #3  (red ring block), stacked  \n  •  1 × #8  (yellow, short rectangular) as mid‐platform  \n  •  2 × #7  (tall green pillars)  \n  •  1 × #8  (yellow, short rectangular) bridging top  \n  •  1 × #16 (orange triangular wedge) for roof\n\nIn total:  \n  –  #2 × 1  \n  –  #3 × 2  \n  –  #4 × 2  \n  –  #6 × 1  \n  –  #7 × 2  \n  –  #8 × 5  (used repeatedly for all yellow horizontal beams)  \n  –  #13 × 1  \n  –  #14 × 1  \n  –  #16 × 1  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one logical bottom‐to‐top sequence for building\nboth structures:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 8   //Left base\n  Step2:  Move block with index 2   //Red cradle on left\n  Step3:  Move block with index 6   //Green block on cradle\n  Step4:  Move block with index 4   //Blue cube #1 on top\n  Step5:  Move block with index 4   //Blue cube #2 on top\n  Step6:  Move block with index 8   //2nd yellow block (side piece)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 13  //Orange wedge (left wing)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 14  //Orange wedge (right wing)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 8   //Right tower’s bottom\n  Step10: Move block with index 3   //1st red ring\n  Step11: Move block with index 3   //2nd red ring\n  Step12: Move block with index 8   //Mid‐level yellow beam\n  Step13: Move block with index 7   //1st tall green pillar\n  Step14: Move block with index 7   //2nd tall green pillar\n  Step15: Move block with index 8   //Top yellow beam\n  Step16: Move block with index 16  //Orange roof wedge\n}\n\nThat completes the structures exactly as pictured.",

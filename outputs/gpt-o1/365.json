        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how to interpret and build the structure shown in your first image using the blocks (and their fixed orientations) from the second image.\n\n1)  DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN (TARGET) IMAGE\n\n•  Overall there are TWO separate sub‐structures:\n\n   (a) A Tall “Tower”:\n      –  Layers/Count:\n         ▪  6 total blocks in this tower.  \n         ▪  From bottom to top:\n            1) A horizontal green rectangular block at the base  \n            2) Two tall, vertical yellow rectangular blocks on the left and right sides  \n            3) A red cube resting between/inside those yellow sides on the lower half  \n            4) A blue cube directly on top of the red cube  \n            5) Another horizontal green rectangular block on top  \n      –  Spatially, the red and blue cubes are “enclosed” by the four rectangular pieces (green top/bottom, yellow sides).\n\n   (b) A “Cradle” Structure:\n      –  Layers/Count:\n         ▪  3 total blocks in this cradle.  \n         ▪  Two red half‐cylinders (“arches”) on the bottom set side‐by‐side to form a cradle.  \n         ▪  A single blue cube sits on top of those red arcs.\n\n•  Grand total of 9 blocks (6 in the tower + 3 in the cradle).\n\n\n2)  SELECTING THE BLOCKS (BY INDEX)\n\nFrom the dictionary, the needed items (with their exact orientation as pictured) are:\n\n– For the TOWER:\n  1.  Green horizontal rectangular block, index 11 (used twice: base + top).  \n  2.  Tall yellow rectangular block, index 14.  \n  3.  Tall yellow rectangular block, index 15 (mirrored orientation).  \n  4.  Red cube, index 9.  \n  5.  Blue cube, index 7.\n\n– For the CRADLE:\n  6.  Red half‐cylinder (left), index 3.  \n  7.  Red half‐cylinder (right), index 4.  \n  8.  Blue cube (again), index 7.\n\nNote that you will use the same cube index (7) in both the tower and the cradle.\n\n\n3)  ASSEMBLY ORDER\n\nA suitable step‐by‐step way to erect the structure is as follows:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 11   // Bottom green rectangle of the tower\n  Step2: Move block with index 14   // Left tall yellow rectangle\n  Step3: Move block with index 15   // Right tall yellow rectangle\n  Step4: Move block with index 9    // Red cube inside tower\n  Step5: Move block with index 7    // Blue cube inside tower (on top of red)\n  Step6: Move block with index 11   // Top green rectangle of the tower\n  Step7: Move block with index 3    // First red half‐cylinder for cradle\n  Step8: Move block with index 4    // Second red half‐cylinder for cradle\n  Step9: Move block with index 7    // Blue cube atop the cradle\n}\n\nThat completes the arrangement exactly as shown in the target image.",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Target Structure**\n\nFrom the photo, there are in fact **two separate mini‐structures**:\n\n1) **Left “tower” (7 blocks total)**  \n   • **Bottom layer** – Two identical red arch‐blocks forming left and right “columns.”  \n   • **Second layer** – One long yellow rectangular block spanning between the two arches.  \n   • **Third layer** – A green rectangular block on the left half and a blue cube on the right half, both sitting on the yellow block.  \n   • **Fourth layer** – A single red arch‐block bridging over the green and blue blocks.  \n   • **Topmost piece** – An orange triangular “roof” piece.\n\n2) **Right “gate” (3 blocks total)**  \n   • Two orange cylinder blocks as vertical supports.  \n   • One green rectangular block laid across the cylinders.\n\nIn total, **10 blocks** are used.  \n\n---\n\n**Which Dictionary Blocks Match?**\n\nBelow is one consistent matching (respecting color and orientation as shown in the dictionary, with **no further rotation**):\n\n- **Left Tower**  \n  1. Red arch (index #2) × 2 for the bottom arches.  \n  2. Yellow rectangular prism (index #12) for the second layer.  \n  3. Green rectangular prism (index #11) for the left side of the third layer.  \n  4. Blue cube (index #6) for the right side of the third layer.  \n  5. Red arch (index #1) bridging over green/blue on the fourth layer.  \n  6. Orange triangular wedge (index #15) as the roof piece on top.\n\n- **Right Gate**  \n  1. Orange cylinder (index #13) × 2 as the vertical supports.  \n  2. Green rectangular prism (index #10) spanning across those two cylinders.\n\nHence the required list of block indices is:  \n• #2 (twice), #12, #11, #6, #1, #15, #13 (twice), and #10.\n\n---\n\n**Suggested Assembly Order**\n\nUse exactly the following JSON‐like format:\n\n{\n  Step1: \"Move block with index #2\",\n  Step2: \"Move block with index #2\",\n  Step3: \"Move block with index #12\",\n  Step4: \"Move block with index #11\",\n  Step5: \"Move block with index #6\",\n  Step6: \"Move block with index #1\",\n  Step7: \"Move block with index #15\",\n  Step8: \"Move block with index #13\",\n  Step9: \"Move block with index #13\",\n  Step10: \"Move block with index #10\"\n}\n\nA typical build sequence is:  \n1) Place the two red‐arch #2 blocks as the left‐tower base.  \n2) Lay the yellow #12 block across them.  \n3) Add the green #11 and blue #6 blocks on top of the yellow.  \n4) Place the red arch #1 bridging over the green and blue.  \n5) Cap it with the orange wedge #15.  \n6) For the right “gate,” stand the two orange cylinders #13.  \n7) Finally, place the green #10 block on top of the cylinders.",

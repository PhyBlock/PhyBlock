        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n1. **Overall Structure**  \n   The scene actually has two separate sub‐structures:\n\n   - **Left “Frame”:**  \n     • Consists of four blocks forming a tall rectangular frame.  \n     • A green rectangular block at the bottom, two tall yellow blocks standing upright on it, and another identical green rectangular block on top.  \n\n   - **Right “House”:**  \n     • Built over a red arch block.  \n     • Two orange cylinders flank the arch (one on each side).  \n     • A green rectangular block spans the top of the arch.  \n     • A blue cube is placed on the green block.  \n     • An orange triangular “roof” piece sits atop the blue cube.\n\n2. **Block Count and Layering**  \n   - The **Left Frame** has effectively two “layers” (bottom green block and top green block) with the two tall yellows standing between. Total of 4 blocks.  \n   - The **Right House** stacks up in four vertical layers:  \n     1) Red arch + two orange cylinders,  \n     2) Green rectangular piece bridging the arch,  \n     3) Blue cube,  \n     4) Orange triangular roof.  \n     That sub‐structure has 6 blocks.\n\n3. **Spatial Relationships**  \n   - Left Frame:  \n     • The bottom green piece lies flat; the two tall yellows are upright on its edges; the top green piece caps them.  \n   - Right House:  \n     • The arch and cylinders share the same base level.  \n     • The green rectangle is directly on top of the arch.  \n     • The blue cube sits on the green rectangle (centered).  \n     • The orange triangular roof rests on top of the cube.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nBelow are the required dictionary blocks and how many times each is used:\n\n- **Index 1 (Red Arch)** used once (front‐facing arch).  \n- **Index 4 (Blue Cube)** used once.  \n- **Index 6 (Green Rectangular Block, horizontal)** used three times  \n  • Two for the left frame (top and bottom)  \n  • One for the green piece on the right house  \n- **Index 8 (Tall Yellow Rectangular Block, vertical)** used twice (the two “columns” of the left frame).  \n- **Index 10 (Orange Cylinder)** used twice (the pair of cylinders on either side of the arch).  \n- **Index 13 (Orange Triangular Roof, left‐right ridge)** used once.\n\nNo rotations other than shown in the dictionary are permitted, so these exact orientations must be used.\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nA suitable step‐by‐step build sequence (referencing the block indices) is:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 6   // bottom green block of left frame\n  Step2: Move block with index 8   // first tall yellow column (left frame)\n  Step3: Move block with index 8   // second tall yellow column (left frame)\n  Step4: Move block with index 6   // top green block of left frame\n\n  Step5: Move block with index 1   // red arch (right house base)\n  Step6: Move block with index 10  // first orange cylinder on right\n  Step7: Move block with index 10  // second orange cylinder on right\n  Step8: Move block with index 6   // green rectangular block on arch\n  Step9: Move block with index 4   // blue cube on green rectangle\n  Step10: Move block with index 13 // orange roof on top\n}",

Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n- **Block Count & Layers**  \n  From the appearance, the red “ring” in the center is actually made from **two** matching red half‐cylinder blocks, joined face‐to‐face to form one large ring.  Through the ring’s center, there are **two** separate blue cubes inserted horizontally (one protruding from each side).  \n  In total, there are **4 blocks** used: 2 red half‐rings + 2 blue cubes.  \n  There is effectively **one vertical layer** overall; the half‐rings stand upright, and the cubes pass through the middle.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships**  \n  • The two red half‐ring blocks meet in the middle to form a complete circular opening oriented front‐to‐back.  \n  • Each blue cube is centered laterally; one is inserted from the left side of the ring, and the other from the right side, meeting in the central opening.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\n- **Red Ring Halves**: The ring (vertical hole front‐to‐back) is formed by blocks **#7** and **#8**, which are the two red “C” shapes that open forward and backward, respectively.  \n- **Blue Cubes**: Each horizontal cube is the **blue cube #9**. Two of these (#9) are needed.\n\nHence, the indices for the exact blocks/orientations are:  \n• 7 (red half‐ring facing front)  \n• 8 (red half‐ring facing back)  \n• 9 (blue cube) × 2\n\n**3. Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is a possible step‐by‐step build sequence. Use the blocks exactly as shown (no additional rotation needed):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7  \n  Step2: Move block with index 8  \n  Step3: Move block with index 9  \n  Step4: Move block with index 9  \n}",

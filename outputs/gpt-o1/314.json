        "content": "Below is one systematic way to account for all of the pieces in the target photo and then specify exactly which dictionary blocks (by index) are used and in what order they go together.  The description is broken into two parts (the left “cabinet‐like” tower and the right “arched” structure), followed by a step‐by‐step assembly sequence.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1.  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA) Left (Cabinet‐Like) Tower\n\n • Total Blocks = 6  \n   – Top and Bottom: 2 flat green blocks  \n   – Sides: 2 tall yellow blocks (one on each side)  \n   – Center Filling: 1 red cube at the bottom and 1 blue cube above it  \n\n • Layers = 3  \n   – Layer 1 (bottom): one green flat block  \n   – Layer 2 (middle): two tall yellow blocks (left & right) with a red cube at the bottom center and a blue cube above it  \n   – Layer 3 (top): one green flat block  \n\nB) Right (Arched) Structure\n\n • Total Blocks = 13  (arranged in 4 layers)  \n   1) Bottom layer (3 red arches side by side)  \n   2) A single wide yellow plank spanning all three arches  \n   3) A tall red “ring” layer made of:  \n      – Four quarter‐cylinder blocks that form the circular hole in the middle  \n      – Four red cubes forming the left and right columns (two cubes stacked high on each side)  \n   4) One final wide yellow plank on top  \n\nThus the right structure has 3 red arches underneath, a wide yellow block, then the large red ring in the middle (itself composed of 8 red pieces), and finally one more wide yellow block at the top.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2.  MATCHING BLOCKS TO THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow are the dictionary indices chosen so that **no rotation** of any block is required beyond how it is pictured:\n\nA) Left (Cabinet‐Like) Tower\n\n • Green “flat” blocks (top / bottom) → Index 10  \n   (A short green rectangular piece lying horizontally.)  \n • Tall yellow side‐pieces → Index 15  \n   (A vertical yellow rectangular block.)  \n • Red cube in the center → Index 9  \n   (A red cube.)  \n • Blue cube in the center → Index 7  \n   (A blue cube.)  \n\nB) Right (Arched) Structure\n\n • Red arches along the bottom → Index 1  \n   (Three copies of the red arch with its curve running front‐to‐back.)  \n • Wide yellow “plank” layers → Index 16  \n   (A long yellow rectangular block lying horizontally; used twice, one above the arches and one at the top.)  \n • Red “ring” in the middle:  \n   – Four quarter‐cylinder blocks that, when combined, form the circular hole → Indices 3 and 4 (two of each)  \n   – The side red columns are built by stacking small red cubes → Index 9 (four cubes total, two on each side)  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3.  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is one possible build order from bottom to top.  Simply substitute the correct block index at each step.\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 10   (Place green flat block for bottom of left tower)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 15   (Left tall yellow side of tower)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 15   (Right tall yellow side of tower)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 9    (Red cube in center bottom of tower)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 7    (Blue cube on top of the red cube)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 10   (Green flat block on top of tower)\n\n  Step7:  Move block with index 1    (Left red arch of the right structure, bottom layer)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 1    (Center red arch, bottom layer)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 1    (Right red arch, bottom layer)\n  Step10: Move block with index 16   (Wide yellow plank above the arches)\n\n  Step11: Move block with index 9    (Bottom red cube of the left column)\n  Step12: Move block with index 9    (Bottom red cube of the right column)\n  Step13: Move block with index 9    (Top red cube of the left column)\n  Step14: Move block with index 9    (Top red cube of the right column)\n\n  Step15: Move block with index 3    (Top‐left quarter‐cylinder for the circular hole)\n  Step16: Move block with index 4    (Top‐right quarter‐cylinder for the circular hole)\n  Step17: Move block with index 3    (Bottom‐left quarter‐cylinder)\n  Step18: Move block with index 4    (Bottom‐right quarter‐cylinder)\n\n  Step19: Move block with index 16   (Final wide yellow plank at the top)\n}\n\nFollowing the above sequence (or any similar bottom‐to‐top order) will reproduce the two structures exactly as shown, using only the given dictionary blocks in their original orientations.",

The ground‐level cylinders (two stacked for the tall column plus one single alongside).  \n     2. The pair of yellow beams arranged horizontally (one left–right, one front–back).  \n     3. The orange wedge “roof” on top of the tall cylinder stack.\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**\n\n   - There is one **tall tower** made by **stacking two orange cylinders** vertically.  \n   - A **third orange cylinder** stands beside the tall stack at ground level.  \n   - **Two yellow rectangular blocks** bridge between the tall cylinder stack and the single cylinder, forming a crosswise “platform.” One is oriented left–right and the other front–back.  \n   - An **orange wedge** (roof shape) caps the top cylinder.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\n- **Orange Cylinders (vertical)** → Block #6 (used 3 times)  \n- **Orange Wedge (roof)** → Block #10 (used once)  \n- **Yellow Horizontal Plank (left–right)** → Block #1 (used once)  \n- **Yellow Horizontal Plank (front–back)** → Block #2 (used once)\n\nThese choices match both the shapes and the orientations in the target image **without any further rotation**.\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the exact format:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 6  \n  Step2: Move block with index 6  \n  Step3: Move block with index 6  \n  Step4: Move block with index 1  \n  Step5: Move block with index 2  \n  Step6: Move block with index 10  \n}\n\nExplanation of order:\n\n• Step 1 and Step 2 place two #6 cylinders stacked for the tall tower.  \n• Step 3 places the third #6 cylinder off to the side.  \n• Step 4 and Step 5 add the two yellow planks (#1 then #2) crossing each other between the tall and short columns.  \n• Step 6 caps the tower with wedge #10.",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\nFrom the picture there are clearly **two separate builds**:\n\n1. **Left Build (smaller “house”/“rocket” shape)**  \n   • **Overall Count**: Appears to use 8 total pieces.  \n     – Two tall green rectangular prisms forming left‐ and right‐hand “walls.”  \n     – Four orange triangular wedges making the middle “pillar” (two wedges placed back‐to‐back to appear rectangular) plus two more wedges on the outer left/right base.  \n     – Two orange triangular wedges forming the peaked roof on top (one wedge each side).  \n   • **Layers & Arrangement**:  \n     – The bottom layer has the two tall green blocks (#9) standing vertically at left and right, with an orange wedge on each outer edge.  \n     – In between the two green blocks is a vertical “orange pillar,” which in fact is two orange wedges placed back‐to‐back.  \n     – On the very top are two orange wedges meeting at a ridge to form the roof peak.\n\n2. **Right Build (taller “tower” with circular opening)**  \n   • **Overall Count**: Appears to use 12 total pieces.  \n     – A yellow rectangular plank at the very base and another yellow plank about halfway up (“balcony” ring).  \n     – Four red arch‐shaped blocks arranged in a circle to create the large circular window/opening.  \n     – Above that opening are two red cubes and one blue cube side by side.  \n     – One green rectangular block as a “band” across the top of the cubes.  \n     – Finally, two orange wedge blocks forming a triangular roof.  \n   • **Layers & Arrangement**:  \n     – **Layer 1** (bottom): one yellow plank (#10).  \n     – **Layer 2**: four red arch pieces (#1, #2, #3, #4) placed in a ring so their curves form a central circular hole.  \n     – **Layer 3**: another yellow plank (#10) creating a balcony ring above the arches.  \n     – **Layer 4**: two red cubes (#7) plus one blue cube (#5), side by side.  \n     – **Layer 5**: one green rectangular block (#8) laid horizontally as a band.  \n     – **Layer 6** (top): two orange wedges serving as the peaked roof.\n\n---\n\n## **Blocks Selected from Dictionary**\n\nBelow is a compact list of which dictionary blocks (by index) are needed and how many times each is used.  (No rotation other than the orientation shown in the dictionary image is permitted.)\n\n1. **Red Arches**  \n   - #1, #2, #3, #4 → each used once, to form the tower’s circular opening.\n2. **Red Cubes**  \n   - #7 → used twice (in the tower above the arches).\n3. **Blue Cube**  \n   - #5 → used once (tower).\n4. **Green Tall Rectangular Block**  \n   - #9 → used twice (left build “walls”).\n5. **Green Rectangular Block**  \n   - #8 → used once (tower “band”).\n6. **Yellow Rectangular Plank**  \n   - #10 → used twice (bottom and middle “balcony” of tower).\n7. **Orange Triangular Wedges**  \n   - #13, #14, #15, #16 → used repeatedly to create both roofs and the left build’s orange “pillar” and side wedges. In total, the left build needs 6 wedges, and the tower needs 2 more for the roof (8 orange wedges altogether).  \n     (Exact wedge‐index choice depends on which orientations match each slant in the target image. One typical assignment is #13/#14 for the roof wedges and #15/#16 for the side wedges/pillar halves.)\n\n---\n\n## **Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one possible step‐by‐step sequence, placing blocks without reorienting them from their dictionary images.  (You may interleave left‐build steps and right‐build steps to suit, but here they are grouped for clarity.)\n\n```\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 9   (left build, left green wall)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 9   (left build, right green wall)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 15  (left build, first orange wedge for center pillar)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 16  (left build, second orange wedge for center pillar)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 15  (left build, left outer wedge)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 16  (left build, right outer wedge)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 13  (left build, top roof wedge, left half)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 14  (left build, top roof wedge, right half)\n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 10  (tower base, yellow plank)\n  Step10: Move block with index 1   (tower arch #1)\n  Step11: Move block with index 2   (tower arch #2)\n  Step12: Move block with index 3   (tower arch #3)\n  Step13: Move block with index 4   (tower arch #4)\n  Step14: Move block with index 10  (tower balcony plank)\n  Step15: Move block with index 7   (red cube #1 above arches)\n  Step16: Move block with index 7   (red cube #2 above arches)\n  Step17: Move block with index 5   (blue cube next to red cubes)\n  Step18: Move block with index 8   (green rectangular band)\n  Step19: Move block with index 13  (tower roof wedge, left half)\n  Step20: Move block with index 14  (tower roof wedge, right half)\n}\n```\n\nFollowing the above plan will reproduce both the smaller left‐hand structure and the taller tower with the circular opening exactly as shown in the target image.",

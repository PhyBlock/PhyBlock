        "content": "**Analysis of the Main (Target) Image**\n\nThere are actually **two separate structures** in the target image.\n\n1) **Left Structure (Arched Gateway)**  \n   - **Layer/Block Count**  \n     - **Bottom Layer:** 3 red blocks (an arch in the center flanked by two rectangular/cube‐shaped blocks).  \n     - **Second Layer:** 1 long yellow rectangular block bridging across the three bottom blocks.  \n     - **Third Layer:** 1 red arch block centered above the yellow bridge.  \n     - **Top Layer:** 2 orange triangular wedges forming a peaked roof.  \n   - **Total Blocks:** 7  \n   - **Color/Shape Notes:** The bottom arches and side supports are red, the bridging beam is yellow, and the roof pieces are orange.\n\n2) **Right Structure (House‐like Tower)**  \n   - **Layer/Block Count**  \n     - **Bottom Layer:** 2 vertical blocks side by side (left is yellow, right is red).  \n     - **Second Layer:** 1 green rectangular block spanning the full width above the red/yellow blocks.  \n     - **Top Layer:** 2 orange wedges forming a triangular roof.  \n   - **Total Blocks:** 5  \n   - **Color/Shape Notes:** The “walls” are yellow on one side and red on the other, a single green band runs across, and the peaked roof is orange.\n\nPutting both structures together uses **12 blocks** in total (7 for the left “gateway” and 5 for the right “house”).\n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nTo match each piece’s color and orientation _exactly_ as shown (without rotating them yourself), you can use the following indices:\n\n- **Left Structure**  \n  1. Two red rectangular/cube blocks for the bottom corners → Index **8** (used twice).  \n  2. One red arch block for the bottom center → Index **1**.  \n  3. One long yellow rectangular block bridging across → Index **13**.  \n  4. One red arch block on top of the yellow bridge → Index **1** (used again).  \n  5. Two orange roof wedges forming the peak → Index **15** and Index **16**.\n\n- **Right Structure**  \n  1. One yellow vertical block (bottom left) → Index **9**.  \n  2. One red block (bottom right) → Index **8** (again).  \n  3. One green rectangular block spanning the top → Index **10**.  \n  4. Two orange wedges for the roof → Index **15** and Index **16**.\n\n> Notice that some indices (e.g. 8, 1, 15, 16) are repeated as allowed by the instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one logical step‐by‐step way to place them (first building the left “gateway,” then the right “house”):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 8   (left structure, bottom left)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1   (left structure, bottom center arch)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 8   (left structure, bottom right)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 13  (left structure, yellow bridge)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 1   (left structure, top arch)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 15  (left structure, left roof wedge)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 16  (left structure, right roof wedge)  \n\n  Step8: Move block with index 9   (right structure, bottom left/yellow)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 8   (right structure, bottom right/red)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 10 (right structure, green band)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 15 (right structure, left roof wedge)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 16 (right structure, right roof wedge)  \n}\n\nThis completes both the arched gateway (left) and the house‐like tower (right) exactly as shown in the target image.",

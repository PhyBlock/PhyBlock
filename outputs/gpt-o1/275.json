        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\nThere are two separate “towers” in the scene.  The left‐hand tower is built around a large red circular opening and topped with an orange “roof.”  The right‐hand tower has two orange cylindrical columns supporting a yellow bridge piece, with an arch and half‐cylinder on top, finished with an orange roof block.\n\nA convenient way to count and describe them is tower by tower:\n\n▶ **Left Tower**  \n• **Layers and Blocks (bottom to top):**  \n  1) A flat yellow rectangular block forming the base.  \n  2) A red circular “hole” section (formed by stacking a red arch piece and a red quarter‐cylindrical piece so that together they make a full circle).  \n  3) Another flat yellow rectangular block forming a “belt.”  \n  4) Above that belt, from left to right, a blue cube and a red cube‐like block, with a green rectangular block spanning the top.  \n  5) An orange wedge block sits on very top as the “roof.”  \n\n▶ **Right Tower**  \n• **Layers and Blocks (bottom to top):**  \n  1) A flat yellow rectangular block as a base.  \n  2) Three orange cylinders arranged so that two form columns of equal height, and one is stacked atop one column to make it taller.  \n  3) Another flat yellow rectangular block bridging across the top of the two columns.  \n  4) A red arch on that bridge, plus a yellow half‐cylinder on top of the arch.  \n  5) An orange wedge block on the very top for the roof.  \n\n**Block Dictionary Indices Required**\n\nFrom inspection of the dictionary image, the following blocks (and orientations as shown) match exactly:\n\n• #1 – Red arch block (used twice, once in each tower)  \n• #2 – Red quarter‐cylinder “corner” (used once, atop the arch in the left tower)  \n• #3 – Blue cube (used once, in the upper part of the left tower)  \n• #5 – Red cube/block (used once, next to the blue cube in the left tower)  \n• #7 – Green rectangular block (used once, as the “band” at top of the left tower)  \n• #9 – Yellow flat rectangular block (used four times total: base and mid‐belt on the left tower, base and “bridge” on the right tower)  \n• #11 – Orange cylinder (used three times, for the two columns and the extra stacked height on one column in the right tower)  \n• #12 – Yellow half‐cylinder (used once, atop the arch in the right tower)  \n• #14 – Orange wedge with its ridge running left‐right (used once, as the roof on the left tower)  \n• #15 – Orange wedge with its ridge running front‐back (used once, as the roof on the right tower)\n\n**Step‐by‐Step Assembly Instructions**\n\nBelow is one possible order in which to place the blocks (feel free to rearrange minor details if desired):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 9  (place as base of left tower)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 1  (red arch on top of left‐tower base)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 2  (red quarter‐cylinder on top of the arch to form the circular opening)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 9  (yellow “belt” on top of circular opening, left tower)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 3  (blue cube on left side above the belt)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 5  (red cube on right side next to the blue cube)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 7  (green rectangular block spanning the top of the two cubes)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 14 (orange wedge roof on top of left tower)  \n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 9  (yellow base for right tower)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 11 (first orange cylinder column on right tower base)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 11 (second orange cylinder column on right tower base)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 11 (stack a third orange cylinder on top of one of the columns)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 9  (yellow rectangular block bridging the two columns)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 1  (red arch on top of the new yellow bridge)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 12 (yellow half‐cylinder on top of the arch)  \n  Step16: Move block with index 15 (orange wedge roof on very top)\n}\n\nThese placements reproduce the two‐tower configuration exactly as shown in the target image without any block rotations beyond what is given in the dictionary.",

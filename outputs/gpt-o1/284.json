        "content": "Analysis of the Target Structure\n--------------------------------\nFrom the picture, the model actually consists of two separate sub‐assemblies:\n\n1) A “three‐arch” arrangement on the left (12 total blocks):  \n   • Base Layer: Three red arches in a row.  \n   • Top/Front Layer:  \n     – One blue cube sitting on the left arch.  \n     – Two yellow half‐cylinders bridging the tops of the arches (one spanning the left/middle arches, the other spanning the middle/right arches).  \n     – One orange cube on top of the right arch.  \n   • Rear Layer (behind the arches):  \n     – Left Arch: one short green rectangular block plus one tall yellow rectangular block behind it.  \n     – Middle Arch: one tall green rectangular block plus one tall yellow rectangular block behind it.  \n     – Right Arch: one short green rectangular block behind it.  \n\n2) A “ring” assembly on the right (5 total blocks):  \n   • Four red corner‐arc blocks arranged to form a circular opening when viewed from the front.  \n   • One short green rectangular block passing horizontally through the ring (“green band”).  \n\nRequired Blocks and Their Dictionary Indices\n--------------------------------------------\nBelow is the complete parts‐list, keyed to the block‐dictionary indices (re‐using indices as needed without re‐orienting any block).\n\nA) Left‐Side “Three‐Arch” Structure (12 blocks)\n  1. Red Arch (#1) – three copies  \n  2. Blue Cube (#5) – one copy  \n  3. Orange Cube (#6) – one copy  \n  4. Yellow Half‐Cylinder (#13) – two copies  \n  5. Short Green Rectangular Block (#10) – two copies  \n  6. Tall Green Rectangular Block (#8) – one copy  \n  7. Tall Yellow Rectangular Block (#11) – two copies  \n\nB) Right‐Side “Ring” Structure (5 blocks)\n  1. Red Corner‐Arc (#2) – two copies  \n  2. Red Corner‐Arc (mirror) (#3) – two copies  \n  3. Short Green Rectangular Block (#7) – one copy  \n\nStep‐by‐Step Assembly Order\n---------------------------\n{  \n  Step1:  Move block with index 1   (red arch)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 1   (red arch)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 1   (red arch)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 5   (blue cube)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 13  (yellow half‐cylinder)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 13  (yellow half‐cylinder)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 6   (orange cube)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 10  (short green rectangular, behind left arch)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 11  (tall yellow rectangular, behind left arch)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 8   (tall green rectangular, behind middle arch)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 11  (tall yellow rectangular, behind middle arch)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 10  (short green rectangular, behind right arch)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 2   (red corner‐arc for ring)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 2   (red corner‐arc for ring)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 3   (red corner‐arc for ring)  \n  Step16: Move block with index 3   (red corner‐arc for ring)  \n  Step17: Move block with index 7   (short green rectangular “band” through ring)  \n}",

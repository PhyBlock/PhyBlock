No rotations other than what is shown in the dictionary have been used.\n\n •  #1  (Red arch, half‐circle underside L–R) … 1×  \n •  #3  (Red quarter‐circle piece) … 2×  \n •  #4  (Red quarter‐circle piece, mirror of #3) … 2×  \n •  #5  (Blue cube) … 1×  \n •  #7  (Yellow cube) … 1×  \n •  #8  (Green rectangular prism) … 1×  \n •  #9  (Yellow rectangular prism) … 3×  \n •  #10 (Orange cylinder) … 3×  \n •  #12 (Small yellow half‐cylinder, axis front–back) … 2×  \n •  #13 (Orange triangular wedge) … 1×  \n •  #14 (Red triangular wedge) … 1×  \n\n3) Step‑by‑Step Assembly Order\n------------------------------\nBelow is one possible order in which these 18 pieces could be placed:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 9\n  Step2:  Move block with index 3\n  Step3:  Move block with index 4\n  Step4:  Move block with index 3\n  Step5:  Move block with index 4\n  Step6:  Move block with index 9\n  Step7:  Move block with index 10\n  Step8:  Move block with index 10\n  Step9:  Move block with index 9\n  Step10: Move block with index 13\n  Step11: Move block with index 14\n  Step12: Move block with index 8\n  Step13: Move block with index 7\n  Step14: Move block with index 5\n  Step15: Move block with index 10\n  Step16: Move block with index 1\n  Step17: Move block with index 12\n  Step18: Move block with index 12\n}\n\nFollowing this sequence will recreate the two sub‐structures exactly as shown in the target image, matching both color and orientation of each block.",

(This single block appears both as an arch at the bottom and a rectangular top portion above it.)  \n   - **Top Layer (Layer 4):** Two red triangular wedges forming a pitched roof.  \n\n   In total there are **6 blocks**.\n\n2. **Which Blocks from the Dictionary?**  \n   - **Bottom Blue Cubes:** Need two of the blue cube (# 7).  \n   - **Yellow Beam:** The horizontally oriented yellow rectangle is # 9.  \n   - **Red Arch Block:** The tall red arch with its opening front‐to‐back is # 4.  \n   - **Red Roof Wedges:** The two triangular prisms that form the roof ridgeline left‐to‐right are # 13 and # 16.  \n\n   (Note that the two wedges # 13 and # 16 are mirror images of each other and together make the symmetrical roof.)\n\n**Required Block Indices**\n\n• 7 (used twice)  \n• 9  \n• 4  \n• 13  \n• 16  \n\n**Assembly Order**  \nUse the following step‐by‐step instruction format:\n\n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 7  \n  Step2: Move block with index 7  \n  Step3: Move block with index 9  \n  Step4: Move block with index 4  \n  Step5: Move block with index 13  \n  Step6: Move block with index 16  \n}  ",

        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one would “re‐create” the little horse‐shaped figure from the two reference images using only the blocks (in the exact orientations) shown in the dictionary. As you will see, there is one snag: the blue sloping (triangular‐prism) piece in the target picture does **not** appear anywhere in the block dictionary in blue. Consequently, we can only match most (but not all) of the target model exactly.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  Overall Shape & “Layers.”  \n   –  Base Layer (Layer 1): Two red arch blocks side by side.  \n   –  Middle Layer (Layer 2): One long yellow rectangular block bridging across the tops of the two arches.  \n   –  Upper Layer (Layer 3 and above):  \n       –  A blue cube on the left.  \n       –  A blue *triangular/wedge* block on the right (the dictionary does **not** have this in blue).  \n       –  A green rectangular block spanning across the top (forming the “neck”/“snout”).  \n       –  An orange wedge perched on top as the “head.”  \n\n•  Total Block Count.  \n   By visual count, there are **7** physical blocks:  \n   1.  Red Arch (left)  \n   2.  Red Arch (right)  \n   3.  Yellow Rectangle (body)  \n   4.  Blue Cube (left “shoulder”)  \n   5.  Blue Wedge (right “shoulder”)  \n   6.  Green Rectangle (neck/snout)  \n   7.  Orange Wedge (head)  \n\n•  The Mismatch.  \n   Everything except that blue triangular wedge can be found in some orientation in the dictionary.  However, the dictionary *only* supplies triangular wedges in orange (indices 13–16), **not** in blue.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) SELECTING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nEven though we cannot replicate the blue wedge exactly, here is how the *rest* of the structure lines up with the dictionary:\n\n1.  Red Arches → Dictionary Block #1, repeated twice  \n    – #1 is the red arch oriented so that the semicircular opening runs left‐to‐right (matching the arches in the target).  \n\n2.  Yellow Rectangular Block → Likely Dictionary Block #8  \n    – #8 is a short yellow rectangular prism lying horizontally (left‐to‐right), just as in the target’s “body.”  \n\n3.  Blue Cube → Dictionary Block #4  \n    – We see at least one blue cube in the target, and #4 in the dictionary is exactly a blue cube.  \n\n4.  Green Rectangular Block → Dictionary Block #7  \n    – #7 is a small green rectangular block.  In the target, the “neck/snout” piece is a green rectangular prism set horizontally.  \n\n5.  Orange Wedge → One of Dictionary Blocks #13–#16  \n    – Those four are orange wedges in various fixed orientations.  From the picture, a forward‐leaning wedge (e.g. #14) would be the closest match to the “head” angle.  \n\nWhat we **cannot** supply is the **blue wedge** (the piece on the upper layer toward the right).  No such piece appears in the dictionary in blue, so we simply cannot select a matching index for it.\n\nHence the blocks we *can* use (and their likely indices) are:\n\n •  2 × Red Arch  →  #1, #1  \n •  1 × Yellow Rectangle  →  #8  \n •  1 × Blue Cube  →  #4  \n •  1 × Green Rectangular Block  →  #7  \n •  1 × Orange Wedge  →  #14  (or one of 13, 15, 16 if the angle suits better)\n\n(Blue wedge remains unmatched.)\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) PROPOSED ASSEMBLY ORDER\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a sample step‐by‐step that places what *does* exist in the correct vertical order.  (We omit the missing blue wedge.)\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1   // first red arch (left)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1   // second red arch (right)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 8   // yellow rectangle spans the two arches  \n  Step4: Move block with index 4   // blue cube sits on the left side  \n  Step5: Move block with index 7   // green rectangular block as “neck/snout”  \n  Step6: Move block with index 14  // orange wedge on top \n}\n\nThat sequence will reproduce the base, the body, and the “head” wedge—everything except for the missing blue triangular block.  Were there a dictionary entry for a blue wedge, we would simply insert its placement before the green block (so that the green piece would rest above both the cube and that wedge).  \n\nIn short, we can match most elements (arches, yellow body, green neck, orange head) exactly from the provided dictionary but cannot supply the blue wedge as shown, since it has no dictionary counterpart.",

        "content": "1) ANALYSIS OF THE TARGET STRUCTURE\n\n• Block Count and Layers  \nFrom the picture, there are exactly four pieces used:  \n  – Two orange cylinders on the bottom (forming “wheels”),  \n  – One green rectangular block in the middle (the “seat”),  \n  – One orange wedge block on top (the “seat back”).  \n\nThey stack in three vertical layers:  \n  – Layer 1 (bottom): the two orange cylinders side‐by‐side.  \n  – Layer 2 (middle): the green rectangular block bridging across those cylinders.  \n  – Layer 3 (top): the single orange wedge resting on the green block.  \n\n• Spatial Relationships  \n  – The two orange cylinders touch each other along their inner edges, oriented so their circular ends face forward.  \n  – The green rectangular block lies horizontally on top of (and spanning across) the two cylinders.  \n  – The orange wedge is centered on top of the green block, with its vertical face toward the rear and sloping face toward the front, forming the “backrest.”  \n\n2) SELECTING REQUIRED BLOCKS (BY INDEX)\n\nConsulting the dictionary image, the matches (without rotating any block) are:\n\n • Green Rectangular Block (horizontal “seat”) → Index 1  \n   (short, flat, green rectangle oriented lengthwise)  \n • Orange Cylinders (front‐facing “wheels”) → Index 6 and Index 7  \n   (these two cylinders are each shown lying horizontally but mirrored; one for the left wheel, the other for the right wheel)  \n • Orange Wedge (sloping “seat back”) → Index 15  \n   (the wedge oriented with a vertical rear face and angled front face)  \n\nHence the needed indices are: 1, 6, 7, and 15.\n\n3) ASSEMBLY ORDER\n\nBelow is one straightforward way to place them, in proper layer order:\n\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 6\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 7\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 1\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 15\"\n}",

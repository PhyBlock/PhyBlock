        "content": "Below is one systematic way to reproduce exactly what is shown in the photo, using only the orientations given in the dictionary (no re‐orienting blocks).  I have broken it into two sub‐structures (“truck” on the left and “house‐arch” on the right), then listed which dictionary blocks are needed and in what order to place them.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•  Overall there are two separate builds:\n\nA)  Left “Truck”‐like Structure  \n   – Layers & Blocks (bottom to top):  \n     1.  Bottom layer has one yellow rectangular block spanning the length, with two horizontal orange cylinders (the “wheels”) on its sides.  \n     2.  Above that is a single green rectangular block (the “bed”).  \n     3.  Then three small cubes form the “cab”: two blue cubes plus one red cube, side‐by‐side.  \n     4.  On top of the cab sit two yellow half‐cylinders forming a rounded roof.  \n\n   – Hence the “truck” uses:  \n     • 1 × Yellow rectangular plank  \n     • 2 × Orange cylinders (lying horizontally for wheels)  \n     • 1 × Green rectangular plank  \n     • 2 × Blue cubes  \n     • 1 × Red cube  \n     • 2 × Yellow half‐cylinders  \n\nB)  Right “House‐Arch” Structure  \n   – Layers & Blocks (bottom to top):  \n     1.  A red arch block on the ground.  \n     2.  A green rectangular plank sits horizontally on top of the arch.  \n     3.  Above that, two blue cubes stacked vertically form a taller tower.  \n     4.  A triangular roof piece (in orange) sits on top.  \n     5.  Finally, two upright orange cylinders flank the arch on each side.  \n\n   – Hence the “house‐arch” uses:  \n     • 1 × Red arch  \n     • 1 × Green rectangular plank  \n     • 2 × Blue cubes (stacked)  \n     • 1 × Triangular roof (orange)  \n     • 2 × Orange cylinders (vertical)  \n\nIn total, there are 16 blocks combining both sub‐structures.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2)  SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMatching shape/color/orientation exactly (no extra rotation):\n\n•  TRUCK BLOCKS  \n  – Bottom yellow plank:  index 8 (yellow rectangular block, horizontal)  \n  – Two orange wheels:  index 12 (horizontal orange cylinder) used twice  \n  – Green bed:  index 6 (green rectangular block, horizontal)  \n  – Two blue cubes (the cab’s front):  index 4 (blue cube) used twice  \n  – One red cube (the cab’s side):  index 5 (red cube)  \n  – Two yellow half‐cylinders (the curved roof):  index 13 used twice  \n\n•  HOUSE‐ARCH BLOCKS  \n  – Red arch on the bottom:  index 1 (red arch block, arch opening forward)  \n  – Green plank above the arch:  index 6 again (another horizontal green rectangular block)  \n  – Two blue cubes stacked:  index 4 (blue cube) used two more times  \n  – Triangular roof piece (orange):  index 16  \n  – Two upright orange cylinders (the side columns):  index 10 used twice  \n\nIn summary, the indices needed (with repeats) are:\n\n• #1  (x1), #4  (x4), #5 (x1), #6  (x2), #8 (x1), #10 (x2), #12 (x2), #13 (x2), #16 (x1).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is one possible order to place the blocks (you may vary it as long as the final result is the same):\n\n{  \n  Step1:  Move block with index 8   // Truck’s yellow base plank  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 12  // Left orange wheel (horizontal cylinder)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 12  // Right orange wheel (horizontal cylinder)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 6   // Green rectangular block (truck bed)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 4   // Blue cube (cab)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 4   // Second blue cube (cab)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 5   // Red cube (cab side)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 13  // Yellow half‐cylinder (roof half)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 13  // Second half‐cylinder (roof half)  \n\n  Step10: Move block with index 1   // Red arch (house‐arch base)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 10  // Left orange column (vertical cylinder)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 10  // Right orange column (vertical cylinder)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 6   // Green rectangular block on top of arch  \n  Step14: Move block with index 4   // First blue cube for tower  \n  Step15: Move block with index 4   // Second blue cube for tower  \n  Step16: Move block with index 16  // Triangular roof piece on top  \n}\n\nFollowing those steps with the listed blocks in the given orientations will recreate both the “truck” structure and the little “house‐arch” exactly as in the target image.",

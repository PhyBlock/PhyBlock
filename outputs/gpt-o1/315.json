Red arc block (index 1)  \n  2. Red arc block (index 2)  \n  3. Red rectangular block (index 9)  \n  4. Blue cube (index 7)\n\n• **Right Group**  \n  1. Green rectangular block (index 14) for the bottom  \n  2. Red rectangular block (index 9) again for the center  \n  3. Tall yellow block (index 15) for left column  \n  4. Tall yellow block (index 15) for right column (same index used again)  \n  5. Green rectangular block (index 14) for the top (same index used again)\n\nIn summary, the block indices needed are:  \n1, 2, 7, 9, 9, 14, 14, 15, 15.\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step sequence (one block per step):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 2\n  Step3: Move block with index 9\n  Step4: Move block with index 7\n  Step5: Move block with index 14\n  Step6: Move block with index 9\n  Step7: Move block with index 15\n  Step8: Move block with index 15\n  Step9: Move block with index 14\n}",

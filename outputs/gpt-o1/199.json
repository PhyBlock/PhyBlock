Bottom tier: Red arches forming two main supports on the left and one on the right.  \n       2.  Middle tier: Yellow rectangular blocks bridging across those arches, plus another red arch or two set above.  \n       3.  Top tier: A single green rectangular block spanning part of the structure, two blue cubes above it, and two orange wedges on the right side.\n\n• Spatial Relationships (left to right)\n\n   –  On the far left, two red arches are placed side‐by‐side on the floor.  Across their tops is a row of yellow rectangular blocks (forming a “bridge”).  Above that bridge sit another pair of red arches.  \n   –  Moving to the center/right, there is one red arch on the bottom, another yellow rectangular block above it, then another red arch on top of that.  A single green rectangular block lies across the top, supporting two blue cubes.  \n   –  At the far right, two orange wedge‐shaped blocks are attached (one slightly in front, one behind).  A small yellow block bridges in at the base behind the wedges (still part of the middle tier).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMatching color, shape, and **orientation** (no rotations allowed other than those shown):\n\n• Red Arches (index 1)  \n  –  Six copies of block #1 (the red arch) are used in exactly the orientation shown in the dictionary.  \n\n• Blue Cubes (index 3)  \n  –  Two copies of block #3 (the blue cube).  \n\n• Green Rectangular Block (index 4)  \n  –  One copy of block #4 is used (its length matches the left‐to‐right bridging in the top tier).  \n\n• Yellow Rectangular Blocks (index 8)  \n  –  Four copies of block #8, each oriented horizontally (as shown in the dictionary image).  \n\n• Orange Wedges (index 14 and 15)  \n  –  One copy of block #14 and one copy of block #15 to form the two orange ramps/slopes on the right.\n\nIn summary, the exact block‐index list is:\n\n   1 × 6  (red arches)  \n   3 × 2  (blue cubes)  \n   4 × 1  (green rectangular)  \n   8 × 4  (yellow rectangular)  \n  14 × 1  (orange wedge)  \n  15 × 1  (orange wedge)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nUse the following order (you may, of course, adjust slightly to taste):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1  (place first red arch, bottom left)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 1  (place second red arch alongside the first)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 8  (place first yellow plank bridging across arches)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 8  (place second yellow plank continuing that same bridge)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 1  (stack red arch above the left plank)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 1  (stack red arch alongside the previous arch)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 1  (place a new red arch on the right side, bottom layer)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 8  (place third yellow plank on top of that right arch)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 1  (another red arch above that new yellow)\n  Step10: Move block with index 4  (set green rectangular block bridging across the top)\n  Step11: Move block with index 3  (add first blue cube on top of green block)\n  Step12: Move block with index 3  (add second blue cube next to the first)\n  Step13: Move block with index 14 (attach first orange wedge on right side)\n  Step14: Move block with index 15 (attach second orange wedge on right side)\n  Step15: Move block with index 8  (final yellow plank at the base behind wedges if needed)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps with the specified blocks (and orientations) will reproduce the target structure as shown in the reference image.",

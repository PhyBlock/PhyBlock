        "content": "Analysis of the Target Image\n----------------------------\n\nFrom the picture, there are two separate “structures”:\n\n1) Left‐hand “Rocket”‐like Tower  \n   • Central Core: One tall orange cylinder.  \n   • Middle “Ring”: Four short blue rectangular blocks arranged in a ring around the cylinder’s mid‐section.  \n   • Base Wedges: Four orange wedge‐shaped blocks, each leaning outward at the base.  \n   • Top “Roof”: One orange triangular‐prism block resting on top of the cylinder.\n\n   Visually it stacks in (roughly) three layers:  \n   – Bottom layer: The four orange wedges around the base.  \n   – Mid layer: The central cylinder (running bottom to top) plus the ring of four blue blocks around it.  \n   – Top layer: A single triangular prism.  \n\n2) Right‐hand “Two‐Column” Structure  \n   • Base: One long yellow rectangular block lying flat on the ground.  \n   • Columns: Two tall orange cylinders standing on the base.  \n   • Top Beam: Another long yellow rectangular block resting on the two columns.  \n   • Roof Piece: An orange triangular‐prism block on top of the upper yellow beam.\n\n   This can be seen as (roughly) three or four layers:  \n   – Bottom layer: The horizontal yellow block on the ground.  \n   – Middle layer: Two vertical orange cylinders.  \n   – Upper layer: The horizontal yellow block.  \n   – Very top: The orange triangular prism “roof.”  \n\nBlock‐Dictionary Matching\n-------------------------\n\nMatching each visible piece to the dictionary (without rotating any block differently from its dictionary orientation) gives:\n\n• Tall orange cylinder (vertical) → Block #6  \n• Short blue rectangular block (lying “flat”) → Block #2  \n• Orange triangular prism with its triangular faces to the front/back → Block #11  \n• Four orange wedges, each in a distinct orientation so they can lean outward around the cylinder → Blocks #13, #14, #15, and #16  \n• Long yellow rectangular block (horizontal) → Block #5  \n\nHence the final parts‐list is:\n\nLeft Tower  \n• 1 × #6 (center cylinder)  \n• 4 × #2 (blue ring blocks)  \n• 4 × (#13, #14, #15, #16) (wedge blocks)  \n• 1 × #11 (top roof prism)\n\nRight Columns  \n• 2 × #5 (yellow horizontal blocks, top and bottom)  \n• 2 × #6 (orange columns)  \n• 1 × #11 (orange triangular prism)\n\nStep‐by‐Step Assembly\n---------------------\n\nUse the following move/placement sequence (15 total moves) to build both structures:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 6   // place the tall orange cylinder (left tower center)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 2   // first blue block around mid‐cylinder\n  Step3:  Move block with index 2   // second blue block\n  Step4:  Move block with index 2   // third blue block\n  Step5:  Move block with index 2   // fourth blue block\n  Step6:  Move block with index 13  // first orange wedge at the base\n  Step7:  Move block with index 14  // second orange wedge at the base\n  Step8:  Move block with index 15  // third orange wedge\n  Step9:  Move block with index 16  // fourth orange wedge\n  Step10: Move block with index 11  // orange triangular prism on top of cylinder\n\n  Step11: Move block with index 5   // bottom yellow horizontal block (right structure)\n  Step12: Move block with index 6   // first orange cylinder as column\n  Step13: Move block with index 6   // second orange cylinder as column\n  Step14: Move block with index 5   // top yellow horizontal block\n  Step15: Move block with index 11  // orange triangular prism roof\n}",

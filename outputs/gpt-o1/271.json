        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\nFrom the supplied picture there are effectively _two_ separate little builds:\n\n1) **Left “table‐like” structure**  \n   - **Total of 9 blocks**  \n   - At the center/top is one small **green** cube.  \n   - Immediately around that green cube are four **blue** blocks forming a cross‐shaped top.  \n   - Sloping outward at the base are four **orange** wedges (one on each “side” of the cross).\n\n2) **Right “arched‐roof” structure**  \n   - **Total of 2 blocks**  \n   - A **red arch** block on the ground.  \n   - A single **orange** wedge set on top front‐to‐back (creating a sloping “roof”).  \n\nSo in total, the target scene uses 11 blocks.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nBelow is the matching from the dictionary (no re‐orientations allowed other than exactly as pictured):\n\n• **Green center**:  \n  – 1 × Block #4 (the small green cube)\n\n• **Four blue cross‐arms**:  \n  – 4 × Block #8 (the small blue cube oriented with a face up)\n\n• **Four orange wedges** (around the base of the “table‐like” shape):  \n  – 1 × Block #13  \n  – 1 × Block #14  \n  – 1 × Block #15  \n  – 1 × Block #16  \n  (These four wedges each have a distinct “lean” so that all sides can slope outward without rotating them.)\n\n• **Red arch (right‐hand build)**:  \n  – 1 × Block #1 (red arch facing front)\n\n• **Orange roof wedge** on top of the arch:  \n  – 1 × Block #10 (wedge sloping front‐to‐back)\n\nIn summary, the needed indices (with quantities) are:\n• #4 ×1  \n• #8 ×4  \n• #13, #14, #15, #16 (one each)  \n• #1 ×1  \n• #10 ×1  \n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nA simple way to place them (you may group by structure if you wish) is:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4  \n  Step2: Move block with index 8  \n  Step3: Move block with index 8  \n  Step4: Move block with index 8  \n  Step5: Move block with index 8  \n  Step6: Move block with index 13  \n  Step7: Move block with index 14  \n  Step8: Move block with index 15  \n  Step9: Move block with index 16  \n  Step10: Move block with index 1  \n  Step11: Move block with index 10  \n}\n\nThis completes the two structures exactly as shown in the target image without any extra rotations.",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\nFrom the provided scene, there are **two separate little “houses”** built from colored blocks:\n\n1. **Left‐Hand Structure (4 blocks total):**  \n   - **Bottom Layer:** A _red arch_ (opening front‐to‐back).  \n   - **Above the Arch:** A single _blue cube_ forming a short tower.  \n   - **Bridging the Top:** A _yellow half‐cylinder_ lying left‐to‐right across the top of the red arch and the cube.  \n   - **Roof Piece:** An _orange triangular “roof”_ oriented so the ridge goes front‐to‐back.\n\n2. **Right‐Hand Structure (5 blocks total):**  \n   - **Bottom Layer:** One _blue cube_ on one side and one _orange rectangular block_ on the other side.  \n   - **Middle (Front Opening):** A _red arch_ whose opening is visible from the front (i.e., left‐to‐right arch).  \n   - **Bridging the Top:** A _green rectangular block_ laid horizontally across.  \n   - **Roof Piece:** An _orange triangular “roof”_ with its ridge left‐to‐right.\n\nAlthough each “house” is shown at slightly different heights, the shapes can be matched to the dictionary blocks **without rotation** other than what is already shown in the dictionary images.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Block‐Dictionary Matches\n\nBelow are the exact dictionary indices needed to reproduce each part as‐pictured (same color **and** same orientation):\n\n**Left‐Hand Structure (4 blocks)**  \n- **Red Arch**: Block #1 (arch opening front–back).  \n- **Blue Cube**: Block #4.  \n- **Yellow Half‐Cylinder**: Block #8 (curved top, axis left–right).  \n- **Orange Roof**: Block #14 (triangular roof oriented front–back).\n\n**Right‐Hand Structure (5 blocks)**  \n- **Blue Cube**: Block #4 (bottom).  \n- **Orange Rectangular Block**: Block #5 (bottom).  \n- **Red Arch**: Block #3 (arch opening faces the front).  \n- **Green Flat Rectangular**: Block #6 (laid horizontally).  \n- **Orange Roof**: Block #13 (triangular roof with ridge left–right).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Complete List of Needed Blocks\n\n• #1 (red arch)  \n• #3 (red arch)  \n• #4 (blue cube) × 2 (one for each house)  \n• #5 (orange rectangular block)  \n• #6 (green rectangular block)  \n• #8 (yellow half‐cylinder)  \n• #13 (orange roof)  \n• #14 (orange roof)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Suggested Assembly Order\n\nA simple way is to build **the left house** first (steps 1–4), then **the right house** (steps 5–9). Following the required format:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 4  \n  Step3: Move block with index 8  \n  Step4: Move block with index 14  \n  Step5: Move block with index 4  \n  Step6: Move block with index 5  \n  Step7: Move block with index 3  \n  Step8: Move block with index 6  \n  Step9: Move block with index 13  \n}\n\nThis places each block in the order needed to recreate both target structures exactly as shown.",

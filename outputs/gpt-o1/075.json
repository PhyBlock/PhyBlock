        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how to reconstruct the “car” exactly as shown, without rotating any pieces beyond what is given in the dictionary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYZE & DESCRIBE THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Block Count & Layers  \n  – There are 9 total blocks visible.  \n    1) Four yellow rectangular blocks forming the car’s flat “platform” (base).  \n    2) Two orange cylinders serving as wheels.  \n    3) Two red blocks stacked above the platform (one is visibly an arch, the other appears rectangular from the front).  \n    4) One orange triangular wedge on top (the “roof”).  \n\n  – They stack in (at least) three vertical layers:  \n    • Layer 1 (lowest): The four yellow blocks making up the car’s base, plus the two wheels attached along the sides.  \n    • Layer 2: Two red blocks on top of the base—an arch in front, a “rectangular” block behind.  \n    • Layer 3 (topmost): One orange wedge resting on the red blocks.  \n\n• Spatial Relationships  \n  – The bottom “platform” is a 2×2 arrangement of four identical yellow bricks.  \n  – Each side of the platform has an orange cylinder oriented horizontally (so two cylinders total).  \n  – On top, a red arch block sits at the front edge, oriented so its half‐circle opening faces the front of the car.  \n  – Behind that arch is a second red piece the same size in plan view but with its arch opening on the (hidden) side, making it appear as a solid rectangular block from this front‐left viewpoint.  \n  – Finally, an orange triangular wedge is placed on top, pitched front‐to‐back like a little roof.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECT REQUIRED BLOCKS (NO RE‐ORIENTATION ALLOWED)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBy matching shape, color, and orientation exactly:\n\n• The four flat yellow rectangles on the base come from block #6 (the short yellow brick laid horizontally).  \n  – Use block #6 four times.  \n\n• The two horizontal orange wheels come from block #12 (the orange cylinder clearly oriented lengthwise).  \n  – Use block #12 two times.  \n\n• The front red arch (opening facing front) is block #1.  \n\n• The rear red “pillar” that looks rectangular from this angle must be the arch with its opening on the right side (so from the left/front view it appears solid). That corresponds to block #4.  \n\n• The orange triangular roof is oriented front‐to‐back, which best matches block #15 from the wedge variants shown.  \n\nHence the needed indices are:  \n[6, 6, 6, 6, 12, 12, 1, 4, 15].\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one possible order of placement (the structure will look the same regardless, but this is an illustrative sequence):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 6\n  Step2: Move block with index 6\n  Step3: Move block with index 6\n  Step4: Move block with index 6\n  Step5: Move block with index 12\n  Step6: Move block with index 12\n  Step7: Move block with index 1\n  Step8: Move block with index 4\n  Step9: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nFollowing those steps (building the base with four #6 bricks, attaching the two #12 wheels, then stacking the two red arches #1 and #4, and finally placing the #15 wedge) reproduces the target “car” exactly as shown.",

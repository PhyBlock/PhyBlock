        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how to re‐create the scene exactly as shown, using **only** the orientations given in the “Block Dictionary” image (no rotations allowed).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN (TARGET) IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The scene consists of two separate “structures” side by side.\n\n◦ LEFT STRUCTURE\n  – Bottom Layer:\n    1. Two red arches, side by side, with the curved openings facing front.\n  – Second Layer (stacked on/above arches):\n    2. A blue cube sits atop the left red arch.  \n    3. Two yellow half‐cylinders sit side by side on top of (and bridging between) the two arches.\n  – Behind/Third Layer:\n    4. A pair of tall green rectangular prisms stand upright behind the arches (one behind each arch).  \n    5. An orange cube rests on top of the right‐side green block.  \n    6. Each green block is topped (or backed) by a tall yellow rectangular prism.\n\n◦ RIGHT STRUCTURE\n  – Shaped like a “gate” or “door frame” made of five blocks:\n    1. A wide yellow rectangular block on the floor (forming the base beam).  \n    2. An upright green rectangular block at the left end of the base.  \n    3. A red cube and then a blue cube stacked at the right end of the base.  \n    4. A second wide yellow rectangular block bridging across the top, resting on the green block (left) and the blue cube (right).\n\nOverall the build uses 15 total blocks and is about three to four “layers” high in places.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  BLOCK‐DICTIONARY INDICES AND QUANTITIES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou will need the following blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary (no rotation other than what is shown in each numbered sub‐image). In parentheses are the total counts needed:\n\n• #1 (Red arch, opening forward): 2  \n• #4 (Blue cube): 2  \n• #6 (Orange cube): 1  \n• #7 (Red cube): 1  \n• #9 (Green vertical rectangular prism): 3  \n• #11 (Yellow wide horizontal block): 2  \n• #12 (Yellow tall vertical block): 2  \n• #14 (Yellow half‐cylinder, flat side down): 2  \n\nNote that the same index may be chosen multiple times, provided the orientation in the dictionary matches the target.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one possible order for placing these 15 pieces (you can vary it as long as the final arrangement matches the target exactly):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1   // Place first red arch (left side, bottom)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 1   // Place second red arch (right side, bottom)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 4   // Blue cube on top of left arch\n  Step4:  Move block with index 14  // First yellow half‐cylinder across the arches\n  Step5:  Move block with index 14  // Second yellow half‐cylinder beside the first\n  Step6:  Move block with index 9   // Green vertical block behind left arch\n  Step7:  Move block with index 12  // Tall yellow block atop that green block\n  Step8:  Move block with index 9   // Green vertical block behind right arch\n  Step9:  Move block with index 6   // Orange cube on top of that right‐side green\n  Step10: Move block with index 12  // Tall yellow block behind the orange cube\n  Step11: Move block with index 11  // Wide yellow block as the right structure’s base\n  Step12: Move block with index 9   // Tall green block on left end of that base\n  Step13: Move block with index 7   // Red cube on the right end of that base\n  Step14: Move block with index 4   // Blue cube on top of the red cube\n  Step15: Move block with index 11  // Final wide yellow block across the top (green to blue)\n}\n\nBy following the above plan and using these exact block orientations (indices), you can reproduce the target structure precisely as shown.",

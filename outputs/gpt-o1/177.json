        "content": "**1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE**\n\n• **Overall Count and Layers**\n\nThere are two separate “buildings” in the scene (one on the left, one on the right), totaling 15 blocks:\n\n– **Left Building (9 blocks)**  \n  1. Three red arch‐shaped blocks (forming the base arches and a central arch).  \n  2. One horizontal yellow rectangular block spanning across the arches.  \n  3. Three green cubes stacked above the yellow block (two side‐by‐side and one above them).  \n  4. Two orange triangular blocks forming a pitched roof on the very top.  \n\n  Visually, you can think of this left building as having five “layers”:  \n  • Layer 1: Two red arches at the bottom.  \n  • Layer 2: One yellow rectangular block bridging those arches.  \n  • Layer 3: One red arch block in the center plus two green cubes (one left, one right).  \n  • Layer 4: A single green cube in the middle on top of the arch.  \n  • Layer 5: Two orange roof triangles, left and right, forming the roof peak.\n\n– **Right Building (6 blocks)**  \n  1. Two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks (one at the bottom and one at the top).  \n  2. Two tall green rectangular blocks standing vertically on each side (left and right “columns”).  \n  3. A red cube and a blue cube stacked in the center space (blue below, red above).  \n\n  This right building can be seen in three “layers”:  \n  • Layer 1: Bottom yellow rectangle.  \n  • Layer 2: Two vertical green pillars on the sides, with the blue cube on the bottom and red cube on top (center).  \n  • Layer 3: Top yellow rectangle, capping it off.\n\n**2)  SELECTING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY**\n\nBelow are all the exact blocks (by index) needed, matching color and orientation exactly (no rotations allowed):\n\n• **Red arch block (#1)** used 3 times (for the three arches in the left building).  \n• **Green cube (#6)** used 3 times (the three green cubes on the left building).  \n• **Yellow rectangular block (#11)** used 3 times total (one bridging the arches on the left, two for the top/bottom bars on the right).  \n• **Orange triangular blocks** #14 and #15 (one each) for the left building’s roof.  \n• **Blue cube (#5)** used once (lower center of the right building).  \n• **Red cube (#7)** used once (above the blue cube on the right building).  \n• **Green rectangular block (#9)** used twice (two vertical columns on the right building).\n\nSummarized list of needed indices:  \n{1, 1, 1, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 9, 9, 11, 11, 11, 14, 15}\n\n**3)  DETAILED ASSEMBLY ORDER**\n\nA suitable step‐by‐step build sequence (first the left structure from bottom to top, then the right) is:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1   (leftmost red arch at bottom)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 1   (rightmost red arch at bottom)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 11  (yellow rectangular block bridging across arches)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 1   (red arch block in the center, on top of the yellow)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 6   (green cube above yellow, left side)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 6   (green cube above yellow, right side)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 6   (green cube stacked on top, center)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 14  (left roof triangle)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 15  (right roof triangle)  \n\n  Step10: Move block with index 11  (bottom yellow bar of right building)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 5   (blue cube centered on bottom bar)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 7   (red cube on top of blue)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 9   (left vertical green column)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 9   (right vertical green column)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 11  (top yellow bar across the green columns)\n}\n\nFollowing the above sequence reproduces the target structures exactly as shown.",

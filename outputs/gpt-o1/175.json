        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can arrive at (and build) the two structures exactly as shown, using only the blocks/orientations given in the “Block Dictionary” image.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n● There are two separate structures:\n\n(A) “Giraffe‐like” Structure (left):\n   – Bottom Layer: 4 orange cylinders forming “legs.”\n   – Above That: A long yellow rectangular block as a “platform.”\n   – Rising at the back: 1 more orange cylinder as the “neck.”\n   – On Top of the Platform: 1 blue cube in the center and 3 orange wedges around it,\n     creating a pitched/angled shape.\n   – At the Very Top (above the “neck”): 1 yellow half‐cylinder.\n\n   Count for Left Structure:\n   – 5 orange cylinders  \n   – 1 yellow rectangular block  \n   – 1 blue cube  \n   – 3 orange wedges  \n   – 1 yellow half‐cylinder  \n   → Total of 11 pieces.\n\n(B) “House‐like” Structure (right):\n   – Bottom Two Layers (4 cubes total): The first row has an orange cube (left) and a blue cube (right). The second row repeats an orange (left) and a blue (right).  \n   – Next Layer: 1 green rectangular block bridging across.  \n   – Top Layer (Roof): 2 orange wedges, one on each side, forming a peaked roof.\n\n   Count for Right Structure:\n   – 2 orange cubes  \n   – 2 blue cubes  \n   – 1 green rectangular block  \n   – 2 orange wedges  \n   → Total of 7 pieces.\n\nOverall, the scene uses 18 total blocks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMatching each shape/color/orientation from the dictionary exactly (no rotations other than what is shown):\n\n● For the Left “Giraffe”:\n   1) Five orange cylinders → Block #10 (used 5 times)  \n   2) One large yellow rectangular block → Block #9  \n   3) One blue cube → Block #1  \n   4) Three orange wedges (each in a distinct orientation).  \n      A suitable choice is to take blocks #13, #15, and #16.  \n   5) One yellow half‐cylinder → Block #11  \n\n● For the Right “House”:\n   1) Two orange cubes → Block #3 (2×)  \n   2) Two blue cubes → Block #1 (2×)  \n   3) One green rectangular block (horizontal) → Block #6  \n   4) Two orange wedges for the roof → Blocks #14 and #16  \n\nHence the complete block‐index list needed:\n\n • #1 (blue cube) ×3  (1 for the giraffe body, 2 for the house)  \n • #3 (orange cube) ×2  \n • #6 (green rectangular) ×1  \n • #9 (yellow rectangular) ×1  \n • #10 (orange cylinder) ×5  \n • #11 (yellow half‐cylinder) ×1  \n • #13 (orange wedge) ×1  \n • #14 (orange wedge) ×1  \n • #15 (orange wedge) ×1  \n • #16 (orange wedge) ×2  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one possible order in which to place or “move” each block into position.  \n(Feel free to group or reorder as convenient; the key is that all pieces must be placed.)\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 10   // 1st orange cylinder (leg)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 10   // 2nd orange cylinder (leg)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 10   // 3rd orange cylinder (leg)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 10   // 4th orange cylinder (leg)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 9    // Yellow rectangular platform on top of legs\n  Step6:  Move block with index 10   // 5th orange cylinder (neck)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 11   // Yellow half‐cylinder (head)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 1    // Blue cube (center of “body”)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 13   // 1st orange wedge around blue cube\n  Step10: Move block with index 15   // 2nd orange wedge around blue cube\n  Step11: Move block with index 16   // 3rd orange wedge around blue cube\n\n  // Now the “house” on the right:\n  Step12: Move block with index 3    // Orange cube (bottom‐left)\n  Step13: Move block with index 1    // Blue cube (bottom‐right)\n  Step14: Move block with index 3    // Orange cube (second‐row left)\n  Step15: Move block with index 1    // Blue cube (second‐row right)\n  Step16: Move block with index 6    // Green rectangular block (middle layer)\n  Step17: Move block with index 14   // Orange wedge (left side of roof)\n  Step18: Move block with index 16   // Orange wedge (right side of roof)\n}\n\nThat completes the two structures exactly as shown in the main image, using only the listed blocks in their given orientations.",

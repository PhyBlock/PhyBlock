        "content": "**Analysis of the Target Structure**\n\nFrom the first (main) image, there are effectively _two_ separate builds:\n\n1. **Small “House” on the Left**  \n   - **Bottom Layer:** Two cubes side‐by‐side (one orange, one red).  \n   - **Second Layer:** A short green rectangular block laid horizontally, bridging across the two cubes.  \n   - **Top Layer (Roof):** A single orange wedge set on top as a “roof.”  \n   - **Total Blocks Used Here:** 4\n\n2. **Tall “Window” Structure on the Right**  \n   - **Bottom‐Most Layer:** One short green rectangular block lying flat as a base.  \n   - **Second Layer:** One orange cylinder standing vertically on the green base.  \n   - **Third & Fourth Layers (the “Window” Frame):**  \n       - A short horizontal yellow block forms the “bottom” of the window frame (resting on the cylinder).  \n       - Two tall green blocks stand vertically on the left and right, forming the sides of the frame.  \n       - Another short horizontal yellow block caps the top.  \n       - An orange wedge sits inside this open “window.”  \n   - **Total Blocks Used Here:** 7\n\nOverall, the entire scene uses **11 blocks** in three principal colors (green, yellow, orange) plus a red cube.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Blocks Needed (by Dictionary Index)\n\nBelow are the exact dictionary blocks (with correct orientations) that match each piece in the scene.  (Remember, the same index can be reused multiple times if the shape/orientation is identical.)\n\n1) **Orange cube (#2)** – 1×  \n2) **Red cube (#3)** – 1×  \n3) **Green short horizontal rectangular block (#4)** – 2×  \n4) **Green tall vertical rectangular block (#5)** – 2×  \n5) **Yellow short horizontal rectangular block (#8)** – 2×  \n6) **Orange vertical cylinder (#12)** – 1×  \n7) **Orange wedge (#15)** – 2×  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Layer‐by‐Layer Description\n\n● **Left “House”:**  \n   - **Layer 1:** One orange cube (#2) and one red cube (#3) side‐by‐side.  \n   - **Layer 2:** One green horizontal block (#4) bridging across the two cubes.  \n   - **Layer 3:** One orange wedge (#15) perched on top.  \n\n● **Right “Window” Structure:**  \n   - **Bottom:** One green horizontal block (#4).  \n   - **Above It:** One orange vertical cylinder (#12).  \n   - **“Window” Frame:**\n       - Bottom beam: Yellow horizontal block (#8) on top of the cylinder.  \n       - Left side: Green vertical block (#5).  \n       - Right side: Green vertical block (#5).  \n       - Top beam: Yellow horizontal block (#8).  \n       - Center: Orange wedge (#15) inside the frame.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Assembly Order\n\nA suitable step‐by‐step build sequence from the ground up might be:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2  \n  Step2: Move block with index 3  \n  Step3: Move block with index 4  \n  Step4: Move block with index 15  \n  Step5: Move block with index 4  \n  Step6: Move block with index 12  \n  Step7: Move block with index 8  \n  Step8: Move block with index 5  \n  Step9: Move block with index 5  \n  Step10: Move block with index 8  \n  Step11: Move block with index 15  \n}\n\nUse the first four steps to build the small house (two cubes, one green bar, one wedge). Then proceed with the remaining steps to place the green base, the vertical orange cylinder, the two yellow horizontal bars, the two green vertical bars, and finally the orange wedge inside the “window” frame.",

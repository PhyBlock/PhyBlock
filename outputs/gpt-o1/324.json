        "content": "Analysis of the Main Target Image\n--------------------------------\nThere are two separate “sub‐structures” in the scene:\n\n(1) Left Sub‐Structure (9 blocks total; effectively one layer):\n•  A central green square block with four blue square blocks snugly around its four edges (forming a plus‐shaped top when viewed from above).  \n•  Four orange wedge blocks are placed around the perimeter beneath/alongside the blue blocks, sloping outward.  \n•  Altogether, this sub‐structure is one layer high but uses 9 individual pieces (1 green + 4 blue + 4 orange wedges).\n\n(2) Right Sub‐Structure (7 blocks total; four layers if stacked bottom‐to‐top):\n•  Bottom Layer: Two red arch blocks (one toward the front, one toward the rear).  \n•  Second Layer: A green rectangular block bridging across the red arches.  \n•  Third Layer: A wide yellow rectangular block sitting on the green block.  \n•  Top Layer: An orange cylinder standing upright in the center, flanked on left and right by two orange wedge blocks.  \n•  This sub‐structure thus uses 7 individual pieces (2 red arches + 1 green rectangular + 1 yellow rectangular + 2 orange wedges + 1 orange cylinder).\n\nBlock Selection From the Dictionary\n-----------------------------------\nBelow are exactly which dictionary blocks (by index) match the target in both shape/orientation and color.  \nRemember: no orientation changes are allowed beyond what is shown in the dictionary.\n\n•  Left Sub‐Structure (9 blocks):\n   –  Center green cube: index 3 (×1)  \n   –  Blue cubes around center: index 2 (×4)  \n   –  Orange wedges around perimeter: index 16 (×4)\n\n•  Right Sub‐Structure (7 blocks):\n   –  Red arches (base): index 1 (×2)  \n   –  Green rectangular block: index 6 (×1)  \n   –  Yellow rectangular block: index 7 (×1)  \n   –  Orange wedges (top ring): index 12 (×2)  \n   –  Orange cylinder (vertical): index 9 (×1)\n\nStep‐by‐Step Assembly Order\n---------------------------\nBelow is one possible assembly sequence (Steps 1–16).  \n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 3        // Place green cube (left structure center)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 2        // 1st blue cube around the green\n  Step3:  Move block with index 2        // 2nd blue cube around the green\n  Step4:  Move block with index 2        // 3rd blue cube around the green\n  Step5:  Move block with index 2        // 4th blue cube around the green\n  Step6:  Move block with index 16       // 1st orange wedge (left structure)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 16       // 2nd orange wedge (left structure)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 16       // 3rd orange wedge (left structure)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 16       // 4th orange wedge (left structure)\n  Step10: Move block with index 1        // 1st red arch (right structure base)\n  Step11: Move block with index 1        // 2nd red arch (right structure base)\n  Step12: Move block with index 6        // Green rectangular atop red arches\n  Step13: Move block with index 7        // Yellow rectangular on the green block\n  Step14: Move block with index 12       // 1st orange wedge (top ring)\n  Step15: Move block with index 12       // 2nd orange wedge (top ring)\n  Step16: Move block with index 9        // Orange cylinder in center\n}",

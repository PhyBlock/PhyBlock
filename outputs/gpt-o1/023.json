        "content": "**Analysis of the Target Structure**\n\n1. **Block Count and Layers**  \n   - The model uses a total of **8** blocks.  \n   - One natural way to view it is in **4 layers** (from bottom to top):  \n     • **Layer 1:** Two short red‐arch blocks on the left and right.  \n     • **Layer 2:** One horizontal yellow plank bridging those arches.  \n     • **Layer 3:** Two green cubes on top of the yellow plank, plus a tall red arch piece standing behind them.  \n     • **Layer 4:** Two orange wedge blocks forming the peaked roof.  \n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**  \n   - **Bottom Layer:** A red arch on the left and a mirror‐image red arch on the right (no block in the very center at floor level).  \n   - **Second Layer:** A short yellow rectangular plank spans from left arch to right arch.  \n   - **Third Layer:** Two green cubes sit side by side on the yellow plank. Behind (and extending above) them is a tall red block with a front‐to‐back arch cutout.  \n   - **Top Layer:** Two orange triangular wedges meet at the peak, forming the roof.  \n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Dictionary Blocks**\n\nBelow is the correspondence between the structure’s pieces and the dictionary indices (no rotations allowed other than as shown in the dictionary image):\n\n1. Bottom‐left red arch ⇒ **Block #1**  \n2. Bottom‐right red arch ⇒ **Block #2**  \n3. Tall red arch behind the green cubes ⇒ **Block #5**  \n4. Horizontal yellow plank in the middle ⇒ **Block #9**  \n5. First green cube ⇒ **Block #6**  \n6. Second green cube ⇒ **Block #6** (same index, used again)  \n7. Left orange roof wedge ⇒ **Block #14**  \n8. Right orange roof wedge ⇒ **Block #15**  \n\nHence the **required dictionary blocks** are:\n[1, 2, 5, 6, 6, 9, 14, 15].\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following stepwise instructions to move each block into place (from bottom to top). Adapt minor details as needed, but the essential sequence is:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 2  \n  Step3: Move block with index 9  \n  Step4: Move block with index 6  \n  Step5: Move block with index 6  \n  Step6: Move block with index 5  \n  Step7: Move block with index 14  \n  Step8: Move block with index 15  \n}",

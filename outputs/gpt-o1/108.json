This matches dictionary index **6**. Two of these are needed.\n\nHence the indices are:  \n• 1 × Block #1 (Blue Cube)  \n• 1 × Block #2 (Green Cube)  \n• 2 × Block #6 (Yellow Half‐Cylinders)\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is a possible step‐by‐step sequence (you may vary the exact order as long as these four pieces end up in the described configuration):\n\n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 2,  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1,  \n  Step3: Move block with index 6,  \n  Step4: Move block with index 6  \n}",

The orange wedge inside the ring rests on the lower yellow beam.  \n   - The final (uppermost) orange wedge sits directly on the small blue block.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nTo match color and orientation **exactly** (without re‐orienting them), the following indices work:\n\n- **Green Flat Rectangles** (used 3 times) ⇒ **Block #3**  \n- **Green Vertical Posts** (used 2 times) ⇒ **Block #4**  \n- **Yellow Horizontal Beams** (used 2 times) ⇒ **Block #6**  \n- **Orange Cylinder** (used 1 time) ⇒ **Block #11**  \n- **Orange Wedges**  \n  - Top “roof” ⇒ **Block #12**  \n  - Wedge inside ring ⇒ **Block #13**  \n- **Small Blue Block** ⇒ **Block #1**\n\n*(Note that the same index is repeated as needed for identical‐orientation blocks.)*\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse this step‐by‐step template:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 3  \n  Step2: Move block with index 11  \n  Step3: Move block with index 3  \n  Step4: Move block with index 4  \n  Step5: Move block with index 4  \n  Step6: Move block with index 6  \n  Step7: Move block with index 6  \n  Step8: Move block with index 13  \n  Step9: Move block with index 3  \n  Step10: Move block with index 1  \n  Step11: Move block with index 12  \n}\n\nAbove, steps 1–3 build the base/cylinder/core, steps 4–8 form the square ring with its interior wedge, and steps 9–11 place the top green block, blue block, and final orange roof.",

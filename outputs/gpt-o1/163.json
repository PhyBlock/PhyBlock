The left structure is assembled first from the base upward, followed by the right structure:\n\n{\n  Step1: \"Move block with index 1 (red arch)\",\n  Step2: \"Move block with index 1 (red arch)\",\n  Step3: \"Move block with index 6 (yellow plank)\",\n  Step4: \"Move block with index 3 (green cube)\",\n  Step5: \"Move block with index 3 (green cube)\",\n  Step6: \"Move block with index 5 (green rectangular block)\",\n  Step7: \"Move block with index 11 (small yellow block)\",\n  Step8: \"Move block with index 2 (blue cube)\",\n  Step9: \"Move block with index 16 (orange wedge)\",\n  Step10: \"Move block with index 10 (yellow cylinder)\",\n  Step11: \"Move block with index 5 (green rectangular block)\",\n  Step12: \"Move block with index 9 (orange cylinder)\"\n}",

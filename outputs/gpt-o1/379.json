Two vertical orange cylinders on the ground, side by side.  \n     2. One horizontal yellow rectangular block bridging across their tops.  \n     3. Another vertical orange cylinder centered on the yellow block, with a half‐cylinder in yellow perched on top.  \n\n---\n\n## Selection of Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBelow are the dictionary indices that best match **color**, **shape**, and especially **orientation** (no further rotation allowed):\n\n1. **Green vertical rectangular block** → **Index 2**  \n2. **Red horizontal cylinder** → **Index 11**  \n3. **Yellow half‐cylinder (around green block’s base)** → **Index 12**  \n4. **Orange vertical cylinders (3 total)** → **Index 10**, used three times  \n5. **Yellow horizontal rectangular block (bridge)** → **Index 6**  \n6. **Yellow half‐cylinder (on top of right‐figure “neck”)** → **Index 13**\n\n---\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nA possible step‐by‐step sequence is:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2   // Place green vertical block  \n  Step2: Move block with index 12  // Attach yellow half‐cylinder at base of green block  \n  Step3: Move block with index 11  // Lay horizontal red cylinder on top of green block  \n\n  Step4: Move block with index 10  // First orange vertical cylinder (right figure base)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 10  // Second orange vertical cylinder (right figure base)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 6   // Yellow rectangular block bridging across the two cylinders  \n  Step7: Move block with index 10  // Third orange vertical cylinder on top of the bridge  \n  Step8: Move block with index 13  // Yellow half‐cylinder on very top  \n}",

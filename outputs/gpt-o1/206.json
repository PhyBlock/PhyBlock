Three red arch‐blocks side by side.  \n         2. One yellow rectangular block bridging across those three arches.  \n         3. Two tall green pillars standing on that yellow block.  \n         4. Another horizontal yellow rectangular block across the tops of the two green pillars.  \n         5. A single orange triangular “roof” block resting on top.  \n     – Total blocks in tower: 3 (red) + 1 (yellow) + 2 (green) + 1 (yellow) + 1 (orange) = 8.  \n\n  B)  Small “car” on the right  \n     – Layers (bottom‐to‐top):  \n         1. Two horizontal orange cylinders as wheels.  \n         2. One yellow rectangular block bridging those two wheels.  \n         3. One blue cube centered on top of that yellow block.  \n     – Total blocks in car: 2 (orange cylinders) + 1 (yellow) + 1 (blue) = 4.  \n\n•  Grand total of 12 blocks, arranged in 5 layers for the tower and 3 layers for the car.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING MATCHING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIn the dictionary image (indices 1–16), the following pieces match both shape and orientation (no further rotation allowed):\n\nA)  Tower on the Left\n   •  Red Arch Blocks (3 needed):\n      – Use index 2 (red arch with the opening oriented front‐to‐back).  \n   •  Yellow Horizontal Rectangular Blocks (2 needed):\n      – Use index 9 for each (short yellow prism lying flat).  \n   •  Green Vertical Pillars (2 needed):\n      – Use index 8 for each (green rectangular prism oriented upright).  \n   •  Orange Triangular “Roof” (1 needed):\n      – Use index 14 (orange triangular wedge correctly oriented to sit as a roof).  \n\nB)  Car on the Right\n   •  Orange Cylinders (2 needed for wheels):\n      – Use index 12 (orange cylinder oriented so that its circular face is visible from the front).  \n   •  Yellow Horizontal Rectangular Block (1 needed):\n      – Again use index 9 (horizontal yellow prism).  \n   •  Blue Cube (1 needed):\n      – Use index 6 (blue cube).  \n\nHence the full list of required block indices:\n\n •  Red arch (index 2) → 3 copies  \n •  Yellow rectangular/horizontal (index 9) → 3 copies total (2 for tower, 1 for car)  \n •  Green rectangular/vertical (index 8) → 2 copies  \n •  Orange triangular roof (index 14) → 1 copy  \n •  Orange cylinder wheels (index 12) → 2 copies  \n •  Blue cube (index 6) → 1 copy  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‑BY‑STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 2\n  Step2:  Move block with index 2\n  Step3:  Move block with index 2\n  Step4:  Move block with index 9\n  Step5:  Move block with index 8\n  Step6:  Move block with index 8\n  Step7:  Move block with index 9\n  Step8:  Move block with index 14\n  Step9:  Move block with index 12\n  Step10: Move block with index 12\n  Step11: Move block with index 9\n  Step12: Move block with index 6\n}\n\nFollowing this order will reproduce both the tall tower (Steps 1–8) and the little “car” (Steps 9–12) exactly as seen in the target image.",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\nThere are two separate sub‐structures:\n\n1) **Left “Tower” Structure (7 blocks total)**  \n   - **Bottom Layer**  \n     - A short green rectangular block lying flat.  \n     - On top of it, one upright orange cylinder.  \n   - **Middle Layer**  \n     - A horizontal yellow rectangular block bridging left‐to‐right (just above the cylinder).  \n     - Two tall green rectangular blocks standing vertically on either side of that yellow block (forming a “window frame”).  \n   - **Inside the Frame**  \n     - An orange triangular wedge fits within the “window,” resting on the middle yellow block.  \n   - **Top Layer**  \n     - Another horizontal yellow rectangular block bridging left‐to‐right, capping off the two vertical green posts.\n\n2) **Right “Car” Structure (4 blocks total)**  \n   - **Bottom Layer**  \n     - Two horizontal orange cylinders side by side (the “wheels”).  \n   - **Top Layer**  \n     - A yellow rectangular block spanning across (above the two wheels).  \n     - A blue cube placed on top of that yellow block.\n\nAltogether, there are 11 blocks arranged in three distinct vertical “levels” for the left tower and two levels for the small car.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nBelow are the block‐index matches (no rotation allowed beyond the orientations shown):\n\n• **Bottom green plate** on tower: index **3** (short green rectangular block lying flat)  \n• **Upright orange cylinder** in tower: index **9** (vertical orange cylinder)  \n• **Middle & top yellow blocks** in tower: index **7** used twice (horizontal yellow rectangular block)  \n• **Two tall green columns** in tower: index **5** used twice (green rectangular block standing vertically)  \n• **Orange triangular wedge** in tower “window”: index **15**  \n\n• **Two “car wheels”** (orange cylinders lying horizontally): index **10** used twice  \n• **Car’s yellow base**: index **7** (horizontal yellow rectangular block)  \n• **Blue cube** on car: index **1**\n\nHence the full set of needed indices is:  \n{3, 9, 7, 5, 5, 7, 15, 10, 10, 7, 1}  \n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is a plausible step‐by‐step way to place them (though many orders are possible):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 3  \n  Step2: Move block with index 9  \n  Step3: Move block with index 7  \n  Step4: Move block with index 5  \n  Step5: Move block with index 5  \n  Step6: Move block with index 7  \n  Step7: Move block with index 15  \n  Step8: Move block with index 10  \n  Step9: Move block with index 10  \n  Step10: Move block with index 7  \n  Step11: Move block with index 1  \n}\n\nFollowing these steps yields the tall, “window‐frame” tower on the left and the wheeled “car” on the right exactly as in the target image.",

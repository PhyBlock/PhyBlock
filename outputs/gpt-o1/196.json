Note that no block is rotated relative to the way it appears in the dictionary; each is used exactly in the shown orientation.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  OVERALL LAYOUT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  There are two separate builds (Left‐hand “tower” and Right‐hand “tower”).  \n•  In total, 18 blocks are used.\n\nA)  LEFT‐HAND TOWER (9 blocks, bottom to top):\n   1.  Two blue cubes side by side (forming the “feet”).\n   2.  One yellow rectangular beam bridging across the cubes.\n   3.  One red cylinder standing vertically on top.\n   4.  An orange triangular wedge on each side of the cylinder.\n   5.  One red “corner‐seat” block perched atop the cylinder.\n   6.  Two yellow half‐cylinders, side by side, forming the curved “roof.”\n\nB)  RIGHT‐HAND TOWER (9 blocks, front to back):\n   1.  Two red arches at the base (front row).\n   2.  A yellow half‐cylinder on top of each arch.\n   3.  One blue cube and one green rectangular block just behind.\n   4.  Two tall yellow rectangular prisms standing behind the green block.\n   5.  One orange cube perched on the top/right side.\n\nLayers:\n•  Each “tower” has essentially three vertical layers:\n   –  Bottom layer: arches or cubes\n   –  Middle layer: prisms/cylinder/wedges\n   –  Top layer: half‐cylinders/cubes\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  DICTIONARY BLOCKS REQUIRED\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  The following indices (and their exact orientations) are used.  \n•  A number is repeated if the same piece appears multiple times.\n\nLeft Tower  \n•  #3 (blue cube) – used twice for the feet  \n•  #8 (yellow rectangular beam) – used once  \n•  #11 (red cylinder) – used once  \n•  #16 (orange wedge) – used twice  \n•  #2 (red corner/seat) – used once  \n•  #12 (yellow half‐cylinder) – used twice\n\nRight Tower  \n•  #1 (red arch) – used twice  \n•  #12 (yellow half‐cylinder) – used twice  \n•  #3 (blue cube) – used once  \n•  #7 (green rectangular prism) – used once  \n•  #9 (tall yellow rectangular prism) – used twice  \n•  #4 (orange cube) – used once  \n\nTotal blocks (with repeats) = 18.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY SEQUENCE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one possible order in which to place (or “move”) the blocks:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 3  (Left tower foot, left cube)\n  Step2: Move block with index 3  (Left tower foot, right cube)\n  Step3: Move block with index 8  (Yellow beam bridging the two cubes)\n  Step4: Move block with index 11 (Red cylinder on top center)\n  Step5: Move block with index 16 (Orange wedge on left side of cylinder)\n  Step6: Move block with index 16 (Orange wedge on right side of cylinder)\n  Step7: Move block with index 2  (Red corner/seat block on top of cylinder)\n  Step8: Move block with index 12 (Yellow half‐cylinder, left side of top)\n  Step9: Move block with index 12 (Yellow half‐cylinder, right side of top)\n\n  Step10: Move block with index 1 (Right tower front-left arch)\n  Step11: Move block with index 1 (Right tower front-right arch)\n  Step12: Move block with index 12 (Yellow half‐cylinder on left arch)\n  Step13: Move block with index 12 (Yellow half‐cylinder on right arch)\n  Step14: Move block with index 3  (Blue cube behind the left arch)\n  Step15: Move block with index 7  (Green rectangular prism next to blue cube)\n  Step16: Move block with index 9  (Tall yellow prism behind green block)\n  Step17: Move block with index 9  (Second tall yellow prism beside the first)\n  Step18: Move block with index 4  (Orange cube perched on the top/right)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps and using the listed blocks (without reorienting them beyond what is shown in the dictionary images) will reproduce the target arrangement exactly.",

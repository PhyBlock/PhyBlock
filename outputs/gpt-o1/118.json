The front two each use one cylinder; the rear one is two cylinders stacked.  \n   - **Second layer:**  \n     - Two yellow rectangular blocks side‐by‐side bridging across the two front pillars.  \n     - A red arch sits upon the left half of the yellow platform.  \n     - A blue cube sits upon the right half of that same platform.  \n   - **Top layer:** An orange wedge “roof” rests on the top of the tall, stacked cylinder at the rear.\n\n---\n\n## Blocks Chosen from the Dictionary\n\n- **Red Arch:** Block **#1** (the arch opening is oriented as shown in the target).  \n- **Blue Cube:** Block **#5**.  \n- **Yellow Platform Blocks:** Two copies of Block **#9** (rectangular slabs in the correct orientation).  \n- **Orange Cylinders:** Four copies of Block **#11** (all used vertically).  \n- **Orange Roof Wedge:** Block **#15** (oriented as shown, no rotation needed beyond what is in the dictionary).\n\n**List of Indices:**\n1, 5, 9 (×2), 11 (×4), 15\n\n---\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step instructions (placing blocks in a sensible build sequence):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 11  // front left cylinder  \n  Step2: Move block with index 11  // front right cylinder  \n  Step3: Move block with index 11  // bottom of tall rear pillar  \n  Step4: Move block with index 11  // top of tall rear pillar  \n  Step5: Move block with index 9   // left half of yellow platform  \n  Step6: Move block with index 9   // right half of yellow platform  \n  Step7: Move block with index 1   // red arch on the left platform  \n  Step8: Move block with index 5   // blue cube on the right platform  \n  Step9: Move block with index 15  // orange wedge roof on top of tall pillar\n}",

The final assembly requires two separate structures (the “ring” shape on the left and the “house” shape on the right), for a total of 11 blocks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  MAIN‐IMAGE ANALYSIS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n●  Left “Ring” Structure  \n   –  Composed of three pieces in a single tall “layer.”  \n   –  A large red block with a circular opening runs vertically.  \n   –  Through that circular opening, a green rectangular bar spans front‐to‐back.  \n   –  A small blue cube sits at the center of the green bar.  \n\n●  Right “House” Structure  \n   –  Built in four vertical layers (bottom to top).  \n     1)  Bottom layer: two blue cubes (left & right) with a yellow rectangular block bridging them.  \n     2)  Second layer: one blue cube on the left and one red cube on the right.  \n     3)  Third layer: a green rectangular block bridging across the top of those two cubes.  \n     4)  Top (roof): two orange triangular wedges forming a peaked roof.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTED BLOCKS & INDICES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n●  Left “Ring” Structure uses:  \n   –  Block #3  (red “tall ring” block with circular hole)  \n   –  Block #10 (green rectangular bar)  \n   –  Block #4  (blue cube)  \n\n●  Right “House” Structure uses:  \n   –  Three Block #4’s  (blue cubes)  \n   –  One  Block #7     (red cube)  \n   –  One  Block #11    (yellow short rectangular block)  \n   –  One  Block #10    (green rectangular bar)  \n   –  One  Block #14    (orange triangular wedge)  \n   –  One  Block #15    (orange triangular wedge)  \n\nIn total, 11 blocks are required:  \n  #3 × 1, #4 × 4, #7 × 1, #10 × 2, #11 × 1, #14 × 1, #15 × 1.  \n\nAll must be used exactly as shown (no re‐orienting) to match shape and color.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP-BY-STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 3   (place tall red ring for the left structure)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 10  (slide green bar through the ring’s opening)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 4   (insert small blue cube in center of green bar)\n\n  Step4:  Move block with index 4   (place bottom-left blue cube of house)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 4   (place bottom-right blue cube of house)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 11  (bridge the two bottom cubes with yellow block)\n\n  Step7:  Move block with index 4   (set second-layer blue cube on left)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 7   (set second-layer red cube on right)\n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 10  (green bar bridging the second-layer cubes)\n  Step10: Move block with index 14  (left orange roof wedge)\n  Step11: Move block with index 15  (right orange roof wedge)\n}\n\nFollowing the above sequence will exactly reproduce the target image.",

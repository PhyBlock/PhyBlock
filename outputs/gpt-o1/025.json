        "content": "**Analysis of the Target “House” Image**\n\n1. **Block Count and Layers**  \n   - The structure uses **nine** total pieces.  \n   - It is easiest to think of it as having **four layers** from bottom to top:  \n     • **Layer 1 (bottom):** 2 cubes side‐by‐side (green on the left, orange on the right)  \n     • **Layer 2:** 2 cubes stacked directly above Layer 1 (green on green, orange on orange)  \n     • **Layer 3:** 3 cubes forming the “window” band (blue on the left, yellow in front‐center, blue on the right)  \n     • **Layer 4 (roof):** 2 orange triangular wedges meeting at the peak  \n\n2. **Which Dictionary Blocks Are Needed**  \n   - **Green cubes (index 2)** – used twice (for the two green columns on the left).  \n   - **Orange cubes (index 3)** – used twice (for the two orange columns on the right).  \n   - **Blue cubes (index 1)** – used twice (for the blue blocks in Layer 3).  \n     - Any blue‐cube index (1, 6, 7, 8) would work, since they are all the same cube in different orientations.  \n   - **Yellow cube (index 5)** – used once (the front‐center cube in Layer 3).  \n   - **Orange roof wedges (indexes 13 & 14)** – one each (forming the pitched roof).  \n\n   In summary, the required block indices are:  \n   • 2 (green) × 2  \n   • 3 (orange) × 2  \n   • 1 (blue) × 2  \n   • 5 (yellow) × 1  \n   • 13 (orange wedge) × 1  \n   • 14 (orange wedge) × 1  \n\n3. **Assembly Order**  \nUse the following step‐by‐step sequence (adjusting your placement as needed so that the colors match the “house” layout shown):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2\n  Step2: Move block with index 3\n  Step3: Move block with index 2\n  Step4: Move block with index 3\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n  Step6: Move block with index 5\n  Step7: Move block with index 1\n  Step8: Move block with index 13\n  Step9: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nPlacing them in this order will recreate the tall “house” with a green‐and‐orange base, a blue/yellow row in the middle, and the two orange wedges forming the roof.",

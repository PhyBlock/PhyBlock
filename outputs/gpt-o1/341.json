        "content": "Analysis of the Target Structure\n\n•  Overall Layout and Layers  \n  – The build consists of two sub‐assemblies:  \n     1) A “tower” on the left made of three red arch‐blocks across the bottom, two yellow beams (one near the bottom and one near the top), two tall green columns in between those beams, and an orange triangular block on top.  \n     2) A “cradle” on the right composed of two red quarter‐cylinders side by side with a blue cube resting on top.  \n\n•  Counting and Spatial Relationships  \n  – The tower uses three red arches on the bottom layer (all lined up left to right); then one horizontal yellow block spanning across them.  Above that are two vertical green blocks (left and right), surmounted by a second horizontal yellow block, and finally the small orange “roof” piece.  \n  – The cradle to the right is formed by two red curved blocks fitted together to form a semicircle on top, with a single blue cube centered over that curve.  \n\nSelecting Dictionary Blocks\n\nTo match color, shape, and orientation (without rotating any piece yourself), the following blocks and indices are required:\n\n•  Red Blocks:  \n  – Three copies of block #2 (the red arch oriented left‐to‐right) for the tower base.  \n  – One copy of block #3 (left quarter‐cylinder) and one copy of block #4 (right quarter‐cylinder) for the cradle halves.  \n\n•  Blue Block:  \n  – One copy of block #7 (the blue cube).  \n\n•  Green Blocks:  \n  – Two copies of block #8 (tall green rectangular prisms) for the vertical “columns.”  \n\n•  Yellow Blocks:  \n  – Two copies of block #10 (the long yellow beam in horizontal orientation).  \n\n•  Orange Block:  \n  – One copy of block #14 (the orange triangular “roof” oriented left‐to‐right).  \n\nAssembly Order\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step instruction template:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 2  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 2  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 2  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 10  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 8  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 8  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 10  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 14  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 3  \n  Step10: Move block with index 4  \n  Step11: Move block with index 7  \n}\n\n•  Explanation of Steps:  \n  – Steps 1–3 place the three red #2 arch‐blocks side by side as the tower’s base.  \n  – Step 4 places the first horizontal yellow beam (#10).  \n  – Steps 5–6 position the two tall green columns (#8).  \n  – Step 7 adds the second horizontal yellow beam (#10) on top of the columns.  \n  – Step 8 places the orange roof block (#14).  \n  – Steps 9–10 assemble the right‐hand cradle from the red quarter‐cylinders (#3 and #4).  \n  – Step 11 sets the blue cube (#7) in place above the cradle.

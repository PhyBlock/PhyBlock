        "content": "Below is a worked‐through solution in three parts:\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n1) ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN/TARGET IMAGE\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n• Overall Count and Layers  \n  – There are 15 total blocks forming two separate “mini‐structures.”  \n  – The left “arch” structure uses 9 blocks in roughly three vertical layers.  \n  – The right “window‐frame” structure uses 6 blocks in about three layers as well.\n\n• Left “Arch” Structure (9 blocks)  \n  – Ground‐level: Two orange cylinders in the center, flanked on each side by a tall green rectangular block and an orange wedge leaning outward.  \n  – Above the cylinders: A red arch spans horizontally from front to back (visible from the front). On top of that arch is a small red rectangular block.  \n  – Top layer: An orange wedge sits on the red block, forming a “roof” peak.  \n\n• Right “Window‐Frame” Structure (6 blocks)  \n  – Bottom bar: A single long yellow rectangular block rests on the ground.  \n  – Vertical sides and center: Two tall green blocks stand at left and right; between them sit two squares stacked (blue on the bottom, red on the top).  \n  – Top bar: Another long yellow rectangular block caps the top, creating a frame shape with a colored interior.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n2) SELECTING MATCHING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nYou must use each block **exactly** as oriented in its dictionary image (no further rotation).  The required indices and their uses are:\n\n• Red Arch (#1) – the main arch in the left structure.  \n• Red Rectangular Block (#5) – two copies needed:  \n  – One atop the arch on the left structure.  \n  – One in the center of the right structure (the red “square”).  \n• Orange Cylinder (#11) – two copies for the two vertical cylinders under the arch.  \n• Orange Wedges:  \n  – #13 (left side wedge at the base of the arch),  \n  – #14 (right side wedge at the base of the arch),  \n  – #15 (the “roof” wedge on top of the arch).  \n• Green Rectangular Block (#7) – four copies total:  \n  – Two for the left structure’s side columns,  \n  – Two more for the right structure’s vertical side columns.  \n• Blue Cube (#4) – one copy for the lower central square in the right structure.  \n• Yellow Rectangular Block (#9) – two copies for the top and bottom horizontal “bars” on the right structure.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n3) STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nA single possible build sequence (placing the left structure first, then the right) is:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 11      // First orange cylinder (left)\n  Step2: Move block with index 11      // Second orange cylinder (right)\n  Step3: Move block with index 7       // Green column on left\n  Step4: Move block with index 7       // Green column on right\n  Step5: Move block with index 13      // Orange wedge on far left base\n  Step6: Move block with index 14      // Orange wedge on far right base\n  Step7: Move block with index 1       // Red arch spanning the two cylinders\n  Step8: Move block with index 5       // Small red rectangular block on top of arch\n  Step9: Move block with index 15      // Orange wedge “roof” above red block\n\n  // Now the right “window‐frame”\n  Step10: Move block with index 9      // Bottom yellow bar\n  Step11: Move block with index 7      // Left green side column\n  Step12: Move block with index 7      // Right green side column\n  Step13: Move block with index 4      // Blue cube in center\n  Step14: Move block with index 5      // Red square on top of blue cube\n  Step15: Move block with index 9      // Top yellow bar\n}\n\nFollowing this plan reproduces the target arrangement exactly, using only the block orientations shown in the dictionary.",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n1. **Overall Structure and Layers**\n\n   The scene actually comprises **two separate builds**:\n\n   • A “rocket‐tower” on the left.  \n   • A small “car” on the right.\n\n   **Rocket‐Tower (3 layers tall)**  \n   - **Bottom Layer:**  \n     - Center: A red “ring” piece (visually one block, but it is most likely formed by _two_ red half‐circle‐cutout blocks placed front‐to‐back).  \n     - Left & Right: Two yellow rectangular blocks of the same height as the red ring.  \n   - **Middle Layer:**  \n     - One green cube on the left.  \n     - Two blue cubes side by side (center and right).  \n   - **Top Layer (Roof):**  \n     - Two orange wedge‐shaped blocks meeting at the peak.\n\n   **Car (single layer + top wedge)**  \n   - **Body:** One yellow rectangular block.  \n   - **Wheels:** Two yellow half‐cylinders underneath (one front, one back).  \n   - **Top:** One orange wedge block centered on the car body.\n\n2. **Block Count**\n   - **Rocket:** 9 total blocks  \n     - Red “ring” = 2 reds (to form the circular center)  \n     - 2 yellow rectangles (bottom left & right)  \n     - 1 green cube  \n     - 2 blue cubes  \n     - 2 orange wedges (roof)  \n   - **Car:** 4 total blocks  \n     - 1 yellow rectangle (body)  \n     - 2 yellow half‐cylinders (wheels)  \n     - 1 orange wedge (top)  \n\n   **Grand total:** 13 blocks.\n\n---\n\n## Selecting Blocks From the Dictionary\n\nBelow is one viable matching of the Target Image to the Dictionary.  \n(Remember, we are _not_ allowed to rotate blocks other than how they appear in their dictionary images, but we may reuse the same index multiple times.)\n\n1. **Red Ring (Rocket Center):**  \n   - Use **two copies of Block #3** (each has a half‐cylindrical cutout).  Placed front‐to‐back, they form the full circular “window.”\n\n2. **Yellow Rectangles (Rocket Bottom Sides):**  \n   - Use **Block #9** for each side.  We need two of them.\n\n3. **Green Cube (Rocket Middle Left):**  \n   - Use **Block #5** (it is the only green cube).\n\n4. **Blue Cubes (Rocket Middle Center & Right):**  \n   - Use **Block #4** twice.\n\n5. **Orange Roof Wedges (Rocket Top):**  \n   - Use **Block #13** (left slope) and **Block #14** (right slope) to form a pitched roof.\n\n6. **Car Body (Yellow Rectangle):**  \n   - Use another **Block #9** for the car’s rectangular body.\n\n7. **Car Wheels (Two Yellow Half‐Cylinders):**  \n   - Use **Block #11** twice.\n\n8. **Car Top (Orange Wedge):**  \n   - Use **Block #14** again (we may reuse the same index).\n\n---\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBelow is one logical, layer‐by‐layer instruction set.  Simply substitute which blocks to “move” in each step:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3    (first half of red ring for rocket bottom)  \n   Step2: Move block with index 3    (second half of red ring for rocket bottom)  \n   Step3: Move block with index 9    (left yellow rectangle for rocket bottom)  \n   Step4: Move block with index 9    (right yellow rectangle for rocket bottom)  \n   Step5: Move block with index 5    (green cube on rocket’s second layer)  \n   Step6: Move block with index 4    (first blue cube on rocket’s second layer)  \n   Step7: Move block with index 4    (second blue cube on rocket’s second layer)  \n   Step8: Move block with index 13   (left orange wedge for rocket roof)  \n   Step9: Move block with index 14   (right orange wedge for rocket roof)  \n   Step10: Move block with index 9   (yellow rectangle for car body)  \n   Step11: Move block with index 11  (first yellow half‐cylinder wheel)  \n   Step12: Move block with index 11  (second yellow half‐cylinder wheel)  \n   Step13: Move block with index 14  (orange wedge on top of car)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps (without reorienting any piece from how it appears in the dictionary image) will re‐create the exact rocket‐tower and car shown in the target scene.",

Bottom layer: 4 × Orange cylinders used as vertical legs.  \n    2. Second layer: 4 × Yellow rectangular blocks forming a large rectangular “seat” resting on the four legs.  \n    3. Third layer: 1 × Orange cylinder standing vertically on the seat as a “neck.”  \n    4. Fourth layer: 1 × Yellow half‐cylinder capping the neck as a “head.”  \n    → Total of 10 blocks in a stack about four layers high.\n\nAltogether the structure uses 19 blocks (9 on the left shape + 10 on the right).\n\n---\n\n**2) Selecting the Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\nMatching each visible piece in shape, color, and *orientation* (no rotating allowed):\n\n1. **Green Center Cube**: Block #1 (× 1).  \n2. **Blue Cubes** around green: Block #4 (× 4).  \n3. **Orange Triangular Wedges** in star shape: Block #16 (× 4).  \n4. **Orange Cylinders** (legs + neck): Block #8 (× 5).  \n5. **Yellow Rectangular Blocks** (seat): Block #6 (× 4).  \n6. **Yellow Half‐Cylinder** (head): Block #10 (× 1).\n\nIndices needed (with quantities) are therefore:  \n• #1 × 1, #4 × 4, #16 × 4, #8 × 5, #6 × 4, #10 × 1.\n\n---\n\n**3) Step‐by‐Step Assembly Instructions**\n\nBelow is one possible order (build the left star first, then the right structure):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 4  \n  Step3: Move block with index 4  \n  Step4: Move block with index 4  \n  Step5: Move block with index 4  \n  Step6: Move block with index 16  \n  Step7: Move block with index 16  \n  Step8: Move block with index 16  \n  Step9: Move block with index 16  \n  Step10: Move block with index 8  \n  Step11: Move block with index 8  \n  Step12: Move block with index 8  \n  Step13: Move block with index 8  \n  Step14: Move block with index 6  \n  Step15: Move block with index 6  \n  Step16: Move block with index 6  \n  Step17: Move block with index 6  \n  Step18: Move block with index 8  \n  Step19: Move block with index 10  \n}\n\nThis sequence places the nine‐piece “star” on the left first, followed by the four cylinder‐leg base, the seat blocks, the neck cylinder, and finally the yellow half‐cylinder “head.”",

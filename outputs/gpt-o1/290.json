        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\nFrom the provided scene, there are actually *two* separate “arched‐house” structures:\n\n• **Left Structure (6 total blocks)**  \n  1) Bottom layer has one red arch‐shaped block in the middle and **two** orange triangular wedges leaning against its sides.  \n  2) Above the arch is a single green rectangular “belt” that wraps around horizontally.  \n  3) The roof at the top is formed by **two** orange triangular wedges meeting at a peak.\n\n• **Right Structure (3 total blocks)**  \n  1) A red arch block forms the base.  \n  2) The “roof” is again two orange wedges that meet in the center peak.\n\nCounting them together, you see:\n- **Arches:** 2 total (1 per house)  \n- **Green rectangular block:** 1 total (on the left house only)  \n- **Orange wedges:** 6 total (4 on the left house, 2 on the right house)  \n\nHence there are 9 blocks in all, arranged in two tiers (arch + side wedges on the bottom, and roof wedges on top), plus the single green “belt” layer on the left house.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks**\n\nMatching shape/orientation from the dictionary (no re‐orientations allowed):\n\n1. **Red Arch (Index 1)**  \n   – This matches the “bridge‐like” arch on the bottom of both houses.  \n   – We need 2 copies in total (one per house).\n\n2. **Green Rectangular Prism (Index 8)**  \n   – The green “belt” around the larger (left) arch is oriented front‐to‐back exactly as in block #8.  \n   – We need 1 copy in total.\n\n3. **Orange Triangular Wedges (Indices 13 & 14)**  \n   – The small wedge blocks #13 and #14 appear in mirror‐image orientations, which lets them form peaked roofs or slanting sides without further rotation.  \n   – Each “roof” needs 2 wedges (one #13 + one #14).  \n   – The left house uses 4 wedges total (two for the sides, two for the roof) = 2× #13 and 2× #14.  \n   – The right house uses 2 wedges total (roof only) = 1× #13 and 1× #14.  \n   – Altogether that is 3 of #13 and 3 of #14.\n\nSummarizing the block indices required:\n\n• #1 (red arch) × 2  \n• #8 (green rectangular block) × 1  \n• #13 (orange wedge) × 3  \n• #14 (orange wedge) × 3  \n\n---\n\n**Suggested Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one reasonable step‐by‐step sequence.  You may group the blocks by house if desired, but here they are simply listed in a logical build order:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1       // Left house arch base  \n  Step2: Move block with index 13      // Left house left-side wedge  \n  Step3: Move block with index 14      // Left house right-side wedge  \n  Step4: Move block with index 8       // Left house green belt  \n  Step5: Move block with index 13      // Left house roof wedge (left half)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 14      // Left house roof wedge (right half)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 1       // Right house arch base  \n  Step8: Move block with index 13      // Right house roof wedge (left half)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 14      // Right house roof wedge (right half)  \n}\n\nUse exactly these block indices (and as many duplicates of each as noted) to reproduce the two arched‐house structures shown.",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n• **Two Identical Structures**  \n  The photo actually shows _two_ copies of the same “house‐shaped” build.\n\n• **Per‐Structure Block Count (8 blocks each; 5 layers)**  \n  1) **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two blue cubes (forming the left and right “legs”).  \n  2) **Layer 2:** One yellow rectangular block laid horizontally across those two legs.  \n  3) **Layer 3:** Two cubes side by side above the yellow block (blue on the left, red on the right).  \n  4) **Layer 4:** One green rectangular block laid horizontally on top of the two cubes.  \n  5) **Layer 5 (Roof):** Two orange triangular wedges meeting at the peak.\n\nHence, _each_ little house uses 8 blocks, and because there are two identical houses, the total shown is 16 blocks.\n\n---\n\n**Block‐Dictionary Selections**\n\nBelow are the dictionary indices needed _for one house_ (you will use each index the indicated number of times). To build _both_ houses, simply double these quantities:\n\n1. **Blue cube** → Index 1  \n   - Needed 3 times (two “legs,” plus one in Layer 3)  \n2. **Red cube** → Index 3  \n   - Needed 1 time (right‐hand block in Layer 3)  \n3. **Yellow rectangular (horizontal)** → Index 9  \n   - Needed 1 time (the “crossbar” in Layer 2)  \n4. **Green rectangular (horizontal)** → Index 7  \n   - Needed 1 time (the “band” in Layer 4)  \n5. **Orange triangular wedges** → Indices 15 and 16  \n   - Each needed 1 time, forming the left and right halves of the roof\n\n---\n\n**Proposed Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is a sample step‐by‐step for assembling _both_ houses. (Each house is 8 steps, so 16 total.)\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1    // 1st blue cube (left leg, House #1)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 1    // 2nd blue cube (right leg, House #1)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 9    // yellow crossbar (House #1)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 1    // 3rd blue cube (left body, House #1)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 3    // red cube (right body, House #1)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 7    // green rectangular top (House #1)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 15   // left orange roof wedge (House #1)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 16   // right orange roof wedge (House #1)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 1    // 1st blue cube (left leg, House #2)\n  Step10: Move block with index 1    // 2nd blue cube (right leg, House #2)\n  Step11: Move block with index 9    // yellow crossbar (House #2)\n  Step12: Move block with index 1    // 3rd blue cube (left body, House #2)\n  Step13: Move block with index 3    // red cube (right body, House #2)\n  Step14: Move block with index 7    // green rectangular top (House #2)\n  Step15: Move block with index 15   // left orange roof wedge (House #2)\n  Step16: Move block with index 16   // right orange roof wedge (House #2)\n}\n\nUsing these exact dictionary indices (without any further rotation) will reproduce the two “house” structures shown in the target image.",

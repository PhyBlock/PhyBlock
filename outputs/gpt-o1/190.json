        "content": "**Analysis of Target Image**\n\nThe target shows _two separate little builds_:  \n1) **“House” on the left**  \n   • **Bottom Layer** – A yellow rectangular beam bridging between two blue cubes.  \n   • **Middle “Wall”** – Two red cubes stacked vertically on top of the yellow beam.  \n   • **Green Band** – A single green rectangular block laid horizontally atop the red cubes.  \n   • **Roof** – Two orange wedge‐shaped pieces meeting at the apex.  \n\n   Counting each cube/beam/wedge as a separate piece, the house uses 8 blocks total.  \n   If you count strictly by horizontal “layers,” there are effectively 5 layers (blue + yellow on the bottom, then two red‐cube layers, then a green layer, then the orange roof layer).  \n\n2) **“Arch” on the right**  \n   • **Bottom Green Block** – One green rectangular block laid flat.  \n   • **Yellow Pillars** – Two tall yellow blocks standing vertically (left and right sides).  \n   • **Top Green Block** – Another green rectangular block laid flat on top of the pillars.  \n   • **Center Wedge** – A single orange wedge block standing inside the arch.  \n\n   This arch uses 5 blocks total over three main layers (green base; the two yellow pillars in the middle layer plus the wedge between them; and the green top block).  \n\nAltogether, there are 13 blocks across both sub‐assemblies.\n\n---\n\n**Blocks Chosen From the Dictionary**\n\nBelow is the exact mapping from the Dictionary (second image) to each piece in the final build. (Note that some entries are reused multiple times.)\n\n• **Blue Cubes (House bottom)**:  \n  – Use block index 1 (blue cube) for the left and right footings.  \n\n• **Red Cubes (House wall)**:  \n  – Use block index 2 (red cube) twice (stacked) for the center wall.  \n\n• **Yellow Horizontal Beam (House)**:  \n  – Use block index 7 (yellow rectangular prism, oriented lengthwise) as the bridging piece along the bottom.  \n\n• **Green Horizontal Block (House)**:  \n  – Use block index 5 (green block oriented flat) for the band just under the roof.  \n\n• **Orange Roof Wedges (House)**:  \n  – Use block index 13 for the left roof slope.  \n  – Use block index 16 for the right roof slope.  \n\n• **Green Blocks (Arch bottom & top)**:  \n  – Use block index 5 again (three total times in this build) for both the bottom and top of the arch.  \n\n• **Tall Yellow Pillars (Arch sides)**:  \n  – Use block index 9 for the left pillar.  \n  – Use block index 10 for the right pillar (same shape, different “no‐rotation” orientation).  \n\n• **Orange Wedge (Arch center)**:  \n  – Use block index 14 for the wedge that sits in the middle of the arch.  \n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nA suitable step‐by‐step sequence (placing the House first, then the Arch) is:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1   // House: blue cube (bottom left)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1   // House: blue cube (bottom right)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 7   // House: yellow horizontal beam  \n  Step4: Move block with index 2   // House: first red cube  \n  Step5: Move block with index 2   // House: second red cube (stack on the first)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 5   // House: green flat block  \n  Step7: Move block with index 13  // House: left orange roof wedge  \n  Step8: Move block with index 16  // House: right orange roof wedge  \n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 5  // Arch: green base  \n  Step10: Move block with index 9  // Arch: left tall yellow pillar  \n  Step11: Move block with index 10 // Arch: right tall yellow pillar  \n  Step12: Move block with index 5  // Arch: green top block  \n  Step13: Move block with index 14 // Arch: orange wedge inside the arch  \n}\n\nFollowing these steps with the exact dictionary indices (and without rotating any pieces) reproduces the target structures as shown.",

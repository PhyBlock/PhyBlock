A short green rectangular block on the ground (base).  \n     2. An orange cylinder standing on that green base.  \n     3. Another short green rectangular block on top of the cylinder.  \n     4. A horizontal yellow block forming the lower “cross‐bar” of a rectangular window.  \n     5. Two tall green blocks standing vertically on either side (the window’s vertical posts).  \n     6. Another horizontal yellow block forming the top “cross‐bar” of that window.  \n     7. An orange triangular wedge sitting inside the window “frame.”  \n   - **Count and Layers:**  \n     - Total of 8 pieces.  \n     - Four distinct “levels” if you look at it from bottom to top.  \n\n2) **Right‐Hand “Frame” Assembly**  \n   - **Overall Layout:**\n     - A rectangular outer frame of two vertical green posts and two horizontal yellow beams (top and bottom).  \n     - In the very center is a circular red “ring,” formed by four identical red quarter‐circle blocks arranged to make one large circle.  \n   - **Count and Layers:**  \n     - Total of 8 pieces.  \n     - Effectively a single “layer” forming a flat upright frame.  \n\n----\n\n**Selecting Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\nBelow is exactly which dictionary blocks (by index) and how many of each appear, matching color, shape, and orientation **as shown** (no rotation allowed).\n\n• **Left‐Hand Tower** (8 blocks total):  \n1. Green base block → index 4  \n2. Orange cylinder → index 10  \n3. Green top block (above cylinder) → index 4 again  \n4. Lower yellow cross‐bar → index 8  \n5. Left green window‐post → index 5  \n6. Right green window‐post → index 5 again  \n7. Upper yellow cross‐bar → index 8 again  \n8. Orange triangular wedge → index 14  \n\n• **Right‐Hand Frame** (8 blocks total):  \n1. Left vertical green post → index 5  \n2. Right vertical green post → index 5 again  \n3. Top horizontal yellow beam → index 8  \n4. Bottom horizontal yellow beam → index 8 again  \n5. Red quarter‐circle → index 2  \n6. Red quarter‐circle → index 2  \n7. Red quarter‐circle → index 2  \n8. Red quarter‐circle → index 2  \n\nIn summary, the full set of blocks needed is:\n\n- #2 (red quarter‐circle) ×4  \n- #4 (small green rectangular) ×2  \n- #5 (tall green rectangular) ×4  \n- #8 (short yellow rectangular) ×4  \n- #10 (orange cylinder) ×1  \n- #14 (orange wedge) ×1  \n\n----\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nA possible step‐by‐step build sequence (listing each block “move”) is:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4   // green base (left tower)\n  Step2: Move block with index 10  // orange cylinder\n  Step3: Move block with index 4   // second green block on top of cylinder\n  Step4: Move block with index 8   // lower yellow cross-bar of window\n  Step5: Move block with index 5   // left green window-post\n  Step6: Move block with index 5   // right green window-post\n  Step7: Move block with index 8   // upper yellow cross-bar of window\n  Step8: Move block with index 14  // orange wedge inside window\n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 5  // left vertical green (right-hand frame)\n  Step10: Move block with index 5  // right vertical green (right-hand frame)\n  Step11: Move block with index 8  // top yellow beam\n  Step12: Move block with index 8  // bottom yellow beam\n  Step13: Move block with index 2  // first red quarter-circle\n  Step14: Move block with index 2  // second red quarter-circle\n  Step15: Move block with index 2  // third red quarter-circle\n  Step16: Move block with index 2  // fourth red quarter-circle\n}\n\nYou will then have reproduced both the tall “window‐and‐cylinder” structure on the left and the square “frame with circular red center” on the right exactly as shown.",

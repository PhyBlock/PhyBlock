The tallest “tower” portion has three vertical layers:  \n    1) The tall orange cylinder at the base,  \n    2) A red U‐shaped block on top of the cylinder,  \n    3) Two small yellow quarter‐cylinders side by side on top.  \n\n•  Spatial Groupings  \n  1) Left Cluster  \n     – A green rectangular block at ground level,  \n     – A yellow cube and a blue cube side by side on top of the green block,  \n     – An orange triangular wedge set behind these cubes.  \n  2) Center Tower  \n     – A tall orange cylinder on the ground,  \n     – A single red U‐shaped piece perched on top of that cylinder,  \n     – Two small yellow quarter‐cylinders side by side on top of the red U‐shape.  \n  3) Right Cluster  \n     – Two red cradle‐shaped pieces on the ground (mirroring each other),  \n     – A blue cube resting on top of and bridging those two red cradles.  \n\nSelecting Dictionary Blocks\n-----------------------------\nTo match shape, color, and orientation exactly (no re‐orienting):\n\n• #5 (Blue cube) – used twice (once in the left cluster atop the green/yellow pair and once bridging the red cradles on the right).  \n• #6 (Green cube) is NOT used; the green piece here is rectangular (#8).  \n• #7 (Yellow cube) – used once in the left cluster.  \n• #8 (Green rectangular block) – used once at the bottom of left cluster.  \n• #9 (Tall orange cylinder) – used once in the center tower.  \n• #4 (Red U‐shaped block with its arch front‐to‐back) – used once atop the tall cylinder.  \n• #2 and #3 (Red cradle blocks) – used side by side in the right cluster.  \n• #12 (Yellow quarter‐cylinder) – used twice on top of the red U‐shaped block.  \n• #16 (Orange wedge) – used once behind the left cluster cubes.  \n\nHence, the required indices (with counts) are:  \n[8 ×1, 16 ×1, 5 ×2, 7 ×1, 9 ×1, 4 ×1, 12 ×2, 2 ×1, 3 ×1].  \n\nStep-by-Step Assembly\n-----------------------\n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 8,  \n  Step2: Move block with index 16,  \n  Step3: Move block with index 5,  \n  Step4: Move block with index 7,  \n  Step5: Move block with index 9,  \n  Step6: Move block with index 4,  \n  Step7: Move block with index 12,  \n  Step8: Move block with index 12,  \n  Step9: Move block with index 2,  \n  Step10: Move block with index 3,  \n  Step11: Move block with index 5  \n}  ",

        "content": "**1)  Description of the Main Target Image**\n\nA convenient way to view the model is as two sub‐structures:\n\n• **Left Sub‐Structure (6 blocks)**  \n  – Bottom‐most is an **orange triangular wedge** holding up a **green rectangular prism**.  \n  – On top of (and alongside) the green prism sit a **blue cube** and a **yellow cube**.  \n  – An **orange cylinder** stands just to the right; bridging across its top and the cubes is a **red half‐cylinder** block.  \n\n• **Center “Temple” Sub‐Structure (11 blocks)**  \n  – The base is a single **yellow rectangular bar** lying flat.  \n  – Four **orange cylinders** stand on that base (two in front, two in back) as columns.  \n  – Spanning the tops of those columns are three **yellow rectangular bars** (a front bar, a back bar, and one bridging bar in the center).  \n  – Above the center bar sits a **red arch** block.  \n  – Finally, two **red triangular wedges** form a peaked roof atop the arch.  \n\nOverall, there are **17 blocks** arranged in four vertical “layers”:  \n• The bottom layer (wedge & base bars),  \n• The second layer (cubes & cylinders),  \n• The third layer (bridging bars & red half‐cylinder),  \n• The top layer (red arch & triangular wedges).  \n\n---\n\n**2)  Selecting the Required Blocks and Their Indices**\n\nFrom the supplied dictionary image, the following pieces (with *exact* orientations as shown) match the target:\n\n1.  **Red Arch** → Index **1** (used once).  \n2.  **Red Half‐Cylinder (U‐shape)** → Index **2** (used once).  \n3.  **Blue Cube** → Index **5** (used once).  \n4.  **Yellow Cube** → Index **6** (used once).  \n5.  **Green Rectangular Prism** → Index **7** (used once).  \n6.  **Orange Triangular Wedge** → Index **13** (used once).  \n7.  **Red Triangular Wedges** → Indices **14** and **15** (one each, forming the roof).  \n8.  **Yellow Rectangular Bar** → Index **9** (used four times: temple base + front/back + middle bridging).  \n9.  **Orange Cylinder** → Index **12** (used five times: four temple columns + one in the left sub‐structure).  \n\nIn total, that is 17 blocks:\n• #1×1, #2×1, #5×1, #6×1, #7×1, #9×4, #12×5, #13×1, #14×1, #15×1.\n\n---\n\n**3)  Step‐by‐Step Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one reasonable bottom‐to‐top sequence (you may vary details, but the general idea is to set lower/supporting blocks first):\n\n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 9   (place the yellow base bar for the “temple”)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 13  (place the orange wedge at far left)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 7   (place the green rectangular block on/near the wedge)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 5   (place the blue cube atop/next to green block)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 6   (place the yellow cube beside the blue cube)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 12  (place the single orange cylinder in the left sub‐structure)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 12  (first orange column in the temple)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 12  (second orange column in the temple)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 12  (third orange column in the temple)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 12 (fourth orange column in the temple)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 9  (yellow bar across the front columns)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 9  (yellow bar across the rear columns)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 9  (yellow bar bridging front and rear)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 2  (red half‐cylinder on top of the left sub‐structure)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 1  (red arch onto the central bridging bar)  \n  Step16: Move block with index 14 (left red triangular wedge forming half the roof)  \n  Step17: Move block with index 15 (right red triangular wedge completing the roof)  \n}",

Two stand side by side at the bottom; the third is stacked atop one of those to form a taller column.  \n   - **Bridging Block:** A single horizontal yellow rectangular prism (#7) laid across the top(s) of the two columns.  \n   - **Red Arch:** A red arch block (#1) centered on the yellow prism.  \n   - **Half‐Cylinder Insert:** A yellow half‐cylinder (#10) fitting under the red arch.  \n   - **Orange Wedge Roof:** One orange wedge (#13) perched on top (giving the “roof” shape).\n\n2) **Right “Framed” Structure (6 blocks total)**  \n   - **Top & Bottom Rails:** Two horizontal yellow rectangular prisms (#7)—one at the bottom, one at the top.  \n   - **Four Cubes Between Rails:**  \n     • Green cube (#4), upper‐left  \n     • Orange cube (#5), lower‐left  \n     • Blue cube (#3), upper‐right  \n     • Red cube (#6), lower‐right  \n\nHence there are 13 blocks in all, arranged in two layers on the right structure and four layers on the left.\n\n---\n\n**Blocks Needed From the Dictionary (with exact orientations)**\n\n• #9 (Orange cylinder) × 3  \n• #7 (Yellow rectangular prism, horizontal) × 3  \n• #1 (Red arch) × 1  \n• #10 (Yellow half‐cylinder) × 1  \n• #13 (Orange wedge) × 1  \n• #4 (Green cube) × 1  \n• #5 (Orange cube) × 1  \n• #3 (Blue cube) × 1  \n• #6 (Red cube) × 1  \n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step (you can of course group the two sub‐structures, but here is one possible sequence):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 9  \n  Step2: Move block with index 9  \n  Step3: Move block with index 9  \n  Step4: Move block with index 7  \n  Step5: Move block with index 1  \n  Step6: Move block with index 10  \n  Step7: Move block with index 13  \n  Step8: Move block with index 7  \n  Step9: Move block with index 5  \n  Step10: Move block with index 6  \n  Step11: Move block with index 4  \n  Step12: Move block with index 3  \n  Step13: Move block with index 7\n}",

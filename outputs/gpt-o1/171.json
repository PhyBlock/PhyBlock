        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can re‐create both the little “car” on the left and the tall “tower” on the right exactly as shown, using the blocks (in their given orientations) from the dictionary images.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  Overall Count of Blocks: 13 total  \n   –  5 blocks compose the small “car.”  \n   –  8 blocks compose the tall tower.  \n\nA) Small “Car” (left side):\n   –  Bottom layer: two yellow half‐cylinder “wheels” side by side, with one short yellow rectangular block bridging them.  \n   –  Above that: another short yellow rectangular block.  \n   –  Top piece: one orange triangular wedge.  \n\nB) Tall “Tower” (right side):\n   Layering from bottom to top:  \n   1.  A horizontal yellow rectangular base.  \n   2.  Two red “half‐ring” blocks joined side by side to form a circular opening.  \n   3.  Another horizontal yellow rectangular block bridging the top of that ring.  \n   4.  Two tall green rectangular pillars standing upright.  \n   5.  A third yellow rectangular block bridging across the two pillars.  \n   6.  An orange triangular wedge forming the “roof.”  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) SELECTING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow are the dictionary indices that match each piece exactly (no rotation):\n\nA) For the Car  \n   •  Wheels (2×): Block #12 (yellow half‐cylinder).  \n   •  Horizontal rectangles (2×): Block #9 (yellow short rectangular prism) for both the lower “bridge” and the top “body” piece.  \n   •  Triangular roof (1×): Block #15 (orange wedge).  \n\nB) For the Tower  \n   •  Base and bridging rectangles (3× total): Block #9 (yellow) used three times.  \n   •  Red circular “ring” (2×): Block #5 (left half of ring) and Block #6 (right half), forming one complete red ring.  \n   •  Green pillars (2×): Block #7 (tall green rectangular block), used twice.  \n   •  Orange roof wedge (1×): Block #15.  \n\nHence the required block indices are:  \n•  #9 (used five times)  \n•  #12 (used twice)  \n•  #7 (used twice)  \n•  #5, #6 (one each)  \n•  #15 (used twice)  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) RECOMMENDED ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one possible step‐by‐step sequence (you may group or reorder if desired):\n\n{\n   Step1:  Move block with index 9   (tower base)\n   Step2:  Move block with index 5   (lower half of red ring)\n   Step3:  Move block with index 6   (upper half of red ring)\n   Step4:  Move block with index 9   (yellow block on top of ring)\n   Step5:  Move block with index 7   (first green pillar)\n   Step6:  Move block with index 7   (second green pillar)\n   Step7:  Move block with index 9   (yellow block bridging top of pillars)\n   Step8:  Move block with index 15  (orange wedge on tower roof)\n   Step9:  Move block with index 12  (first “car” wheel)\n   Step10: Move block with index 12  (second “car” wheel)\n   Step11: Move block with index 9   (yellow block bridging wheels)\n   Step12: Move block with index 9   (yellow block above the “bridge”)\n   Step13: Move block with index 15  (orange wedge on top of car)\n}\n\nFollowing the above steps (and taking care not to rotate any of these dictionary blocks) will reproduce the target scene as shown.",

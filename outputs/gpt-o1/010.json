        "content": "**Analysis of the Target Image**\n\n1. **Overall Shape and Layers**  \n   - The model is built around a single tall **cylindrical** core (orange).  \n   - Around the base of the cylinder is a **square “ring”** made of four small **blue** rectangular blocks.  \n   - Four **orange wedge**‐shaped blocks lean outward at 90° intervals around that ring.  \n   - On top of the cylinder is a single **orange wedge** block forming a “roof” or cap.  \n   - In total there are **10 blocks** arranged in essentially **two levels** (base level with the ring/cylinder/wedges, and the top wedge).\n\n2. **Which Blocks From the Dictionary Match?**  \n   - **Center Cylinder (vertical/orange):**  \n     • The only vertically oriented cylinder in the dictionary is block 4.  \n     • Although it appears “blue” in the dictionary thumbnail, it is the only upright cylinder and thus must be used to match the target’s shape/orientation.  \n   - **Blue Ring (4 small rectangular blocks):**  \n     • Blocks 1, 2, and 3 are the same blue rectangular prism in three different orientations.  \n     • The ring is a flat, horizontal arrangement, so block 1 (lying flat) is the best match.  \n     • We use block 1 four times (one for each side of the ring).  \n   - **Four Outward‐Leaning Orange Wedges at Base:**  \n     • The dictionary shows several orange wedges (7 – 16) in different orientations.  \n     • To have four wedges each leaning outward a different direction without re‐orienting them, we need the four distinct orientations given by blocks 13, 14, 15, 16 (they are the same wedge but “turned” four ways).  \n   - **Orange “Roof” Block on Top:**  \n     • Among the orange wedges, block 8 has the correct “pitched” orientation to rest on top of the cylinder as seen in the target image.  \n\n**List of Required Block Indices**\n1. One copy of block 4 (vertical cylinder).  \n2. Four copies of block 1 (the blue rectangular prism lying flat).  \n3. One each of blocks 13, 14, 15, 16 (the 4 outward‐leaning orange wedges).  \n4. One copy of block 8 (the orange wedge “roof”).  \n\n**Assembly Order**\nUse the following step‐by‐step format (you may of course place the ring or the cylinder first as you prefer).  One reasonable sequence is:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1  \n  Step3: Move block with index 1  \n  Step4: Move block with index 1  \n  Step5: Move block with index 1  \n  Step6: Move block with index 13  \n  Step7: Move block with index 14  \n  Step8: Move block with index 15  \n  Step9: Move block with index 16  \n  Step10: Move block with index 8  \n}",

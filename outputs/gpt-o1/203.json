        "content": "Below is one way to account for (and build) both of the structures shown.  First is a block‐by‐block “tour” of what we see in the target image and which dictionary pieces match.  Then comes a suggested order in which one might place the blocks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF THE MAIN (TARGET) IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA.  Left‐Hand “Tower” Structure\n•  Overall it uses six pieces:  \n   – Three tall orange cylinders stacked or side‐by‐side (#7 in the dictionary).  \n   – Two yellow rectangular prisms arranged in a “T” shape around the midpoint (#4 for the horizontally‐oriented one and #5 for the perpendicular one, so that no rotation is needed).  \n   – One orange wedge on top as a small “roof” (#9).  \n•  Layering/Arrangement:  \n   1.  The bottom comprises two orange cylinders: one is actually two #7’s stacked to make a very tall column, the other is a single #7 of the same diameter but shorter.  \n   2.  Partway up, bridging across the tall column and the shorter column, are the two yellow blocks in a T layout (one front–back, the other left–right).  \n   3.  A final orange wedge (#9) sits atop the tall cylinder to form a little triangular peak.\n\nB.  Right‐Hand “Arch” Structure\n•  Overall it uses seven pieces:  \n   – Two red arch blocks (#1) on the ground, side by side.  \n   – One horizontal yellow rectangular block (#4) bridging those two arches.  \n   – A third red arch block (#2) above that (oriented slightly differently than #1 so that no rotation is required from the dictionary view).  \n   – Another horizontal yellow rectangular block (#4) spanning across that upper arch.  \n   – Two orange wedges (#13 and #14) placed as mirror‐image halves of the roof.  \n•  Layering/Arrangement:  \n   1.  The bottom layer has the two red arch blocks (#1) forming an open arcade.  \n   2.  The second layer is one yellow plank (#4) laid across the arches.  \n   3.  Above that sits the third arch block (#2), whose “cutout” is oriented differently from #1.  \n   4.  Another yellow block (#4) runs across the top of that arch.  \n   5.  Finally, two orange wedges (#13 and #14) meet at the ridge line to form the pitched roof.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  EXACT LIST OF DICTIONARY BLOCKS REQUIRED\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n•  Red Arch #1:  2 copies  \n•  Red Arch #2:  1 copy  \n•  Yellow Rectangular #4:  3 copies  (1 for the T‐bar on the left tower and 2 for the arches structure)  \n•  Yellow Rectangular #5:  1 copy   (the perpendicular “stem” of the T on the left tower)  \n•  Orange Cylinder #7:     3 copies (two stacked for the tall column + one shorter column)  \n•  Orange Wedge #9:        1 copy   (roof on the left tower)  \n•  Orange Wedge #13:       1 copy  \n•  Orange Wedge #14:       1 copy   (together #13 & #14 form the right‐hand roof)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  SUGGESTED STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is one possible sequence (you could build left and right structures in any order, but this list goes roughly bottom‐to‐top):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7  (place first orange cylinder for the left tower base)\n  Step2: Move block with index 7  (stack a second orange cylinder on top to make the tall left tower)\n  Step3: Move block with index 7  (place the shorter orange cylinder alongside the tall one)\n\n  Step4: Move block with index 4  (place the horizontal yellow block as the “T‐bar” on the left)\n  Step5: Move block with index 5  (place the perpendicular yellow block to complete the T)\n\n  Step6: Move block with index 9  (place the orange wedge on top of the tall tower)\n\n  Step7: Move block with index 1  (first red arch for the right‐hand base)\n  Step8: Move block with index 1  (second red arch beside it)\n  Step9: Move block with index 4  (yellow rectangular block bridging those two arches)\n\n  Step10: Move block with index 2 (the differently oriented red arch on top of that yellow block)\n  Step11: Move block with index 4 (second yellow rectangular block across the top arch)\n\n  Step12: Move block with index 13 (first orange roof wedge on the right‐hand structure)\n  Step13: Move block with index 14 (second orange roof wedge, completing the pitched roof)\n}\n\nThat completes the two‐part structure exactly as shown, without any forbidden rotations.",

The green rectangular block is positioned so that it shares a vertical edge or face with the cylinder (they touch at their sides).  \n  – The orange cylinder rests horizontally across the top of the green block, forming the “cap” over the structure.  \n\nSelection of Required Blocks from Dictionary  \n• Needed Blocks  \n  – Yellow upright cylinder → Block index 11 (matches the vertical cylinder orientation shown).  \n  – Green upright rectangular block → Block index 3 (the vertical green prism).  \n  – Orange horizontal cylinder → Block index 7 (the horizontally oriented orange cylinder).  \n\nAssembly Order  \nUse the following step-by-step sequence (you may of course place them physically as needed, but this gives a logical build order):  \n\n{\n  Step1: \"Move block with index 11\",\n  Step2: \"Move block with index 3\",\n  Step3: \"Move block with index 7\"\n}  ",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n1. **Block Count and Layers**  \n   - **Total Blocks:** 5  \n       1. A long yellow rectangular “body” block on the bottom.  \n       2. Two yellow half‐cylinders used as “wheels”—one at the front edge, one at the rear edge.  \n       3. A smaller yellow rectangular block stacked on top of the long rectangle.  \n       4. One orange triangular‐prism (“roof”) block resting at the very top.  \n   - **Layering:**  \n       - **Layer 1:** The long rectangular block with the two half‐cylinders underneath (front and back).  \n       - **Layer 2:** A shorter rectangular block placed on top of the long rectangle.  \n       - **Layer 3:** The single orange triangular/prism block at the top.  \n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**  \n   - The two half‐cylinders (“wheels”) sit under the front and rear edges of the long rectangle.  \n   - The shorter rectangle is centered atop the long rectangle.  \n   - The orange triangular block is centered on the very top.  \n\n---\n\n**Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\nTo match shape, color, and orientation exactly (without any further rotation):\n\n1. **Long Yellow Rectangle (bottom body):**  \n   - Use **Block #4** (the horizontally oriented long yellow rectangular prism).  \n\n2. **Two Yellow Half‐Cylinders (wheels):**  \n   - Use **Block #5** twice. Although #5 appears with its curved face “up,” it is the only yellow half‐cylinder oriented left–right (the same axis as in the car) and thus best matches the “wheel” position in the target image without rotating.  \n\n3. **Short Yellow Rectangle (upper body):**  \n   - Use **Block #1** (the shorter yellow rectangular prism in a horizontal orientation).  \n\n4. **Orange Triangular/Prism Block (roof):**  \n   - Use **Block #11**, which has the correct symmetric “roof” shape and orientation.  \n\n**List of Required Block Indices:**  \n[4, 5, 5, 1, 11]\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step template:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4  // Place the long yellow rectangle (car body).\n  Step2: Move block with index 5  // Attach first half‐cylinder wheel at one edge.\n  Step3: Move block with index 5  // Attach second half‐cylinder wheel at the opposite edge.\n  Step4: Move block with index 1  // Stack the short yellow rectangle on top.\n  Step5: Move block with index 11 // Finally place the triangular orange “roof” on top.\n}",

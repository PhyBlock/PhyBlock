        "content": "Below is one coherent way to “read off” and reconstruct the scene from the two reference images.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN (TARGET) IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  Overall there are two separate “towers” or groupings, for a total of 18 blocks.\n\nA.  Left‐Hand Tower (9 blocks total)\n   –  Orange Cylinders (4):\n      Three stacked vertically to form a tall column,\n      plus one more shorter column off to one side.\n   –  Yellow Rectangular Prisms (2):\n      At mid‐height, two yellow blocks form a “T” shape,\n      bridging between the tall cylinder and the shorter one.\n   –  Orange Triangular Roofs (3):\n      One perched atop the tall cylinder,\n      and two more sitting on top of the two yellow blocks.\n\nB.  Right‐Hand Tower (9 blocks total)\n   –  Base & Uprights:\n      1 green rectangular prism laid horizontally at the bottom,\n      atop which sits 1 vertical orange cylinder.\n      Two vertical green rectangular prisms form the sides of a “window.”\n   –  Yellow Rectangular Prisms (2):\n      One yellow block across the front (lower) edge of the “window,”\n      and one across its top edge, both horizontal.\n   –  Green & Blue Blocks on Top:\n      One more green rectangular prism lies on top of the upper yellow bar,\n      with a small blue rectangular block perched right above it.\n   –  Orange Triangular Roof (1):\n      Placed inside the “window” space, resting on top of the orange cylinder.\n\nLayers summary:\n•  Each tower is built from the bottom up (cylinders or green blocks at the base;  \n   rectangular blocks bridging or framing in mid‐layers; triangular “roof” blocks on top).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHere are the dictionary indices needed, matching color and orientation exactly (no re‐orienting allowed):\n\nLEFT TOWER\n•  Orange vertical cylinder:  index 10  \n   –  Used 4 times (all four upright orange cylinders).  \n•  Yellow rectangular prism (long side left‐to‐right):  index 6  \n   –  Used 1 time (the yellow block bridging horizontally).  \n•  Yellow rectangular prism (long side front‐to‐back):  index 9  \n   –  Used 1 time (the perpendicular yellow block).  \n•  Orange triangular roofs:  \n   –  index 13 (ridge left‐to‐right):  used 2 times  \n   –  index 14 (ridge front‐to‐back): used 1 time  \n\nRIGHT TOWER\n•  Green rectangular prism, horizontal:  index 3  \n   –  Used 2 times (the green base block and the green top block).  \n•  Green rectangular prism, vertical:  index 4  \n   –  Used 2 times (the two upright green “window‐frame” sides).  \n•  Orange vertical cylinder:  index 10  \n   –  Used 1 time (the orange column in the middle).  \n•  Yellow rectangular prism, horizontal (long side left‐to‐right): index 6  \n   –  Used 2 times (the two yellow bars that form the lower and upper edges of the “window”).  \n•  Blue small rectangular block (lying “flat”): index 1  \n   –  Used 1 time (the blue cube‐like block on the very top).  \n•  Orange triangular roof (ridge left‐to‐right): index 13  \n   –  Used 1 time (the triangular piece in the “window” interior).  \n\nIn total, that yields 18 blocks matching the target exactly.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one possible assembly sequence from the ground up.  \nUse the exact format “StepX: Move block with index …” as follows:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 10       // bottom orange cylinder (left tower)\n  Step2: Move block with index 10       // second orange cylinder (left tower)\n  Step3: Move block with index 10       // third orange cylinder (left tower)\n  Step4: Move block with index 10       // shorter side cylinder (left tower)\n  Step5: Move block with index 6        // yellow block bridging left-right\n  Step6: Move block with index 9        // yellow block bridging front-back\n  Step7: Move block with index 13       // roof on top of tall cylinder\n  Step8: Move block with index 13       // roof on one yellow block\n  Step9: Move block with index 14       // roof on the other yellow block\n\n  Step10: Move block with index 3       // green block at very bottom (right tower)\n  Step11: Move block with index 10      // orange cylinder above green base\n  Step12: Move block with index 6       // yellow “window” ledge (lower bar)\n  Step13: Move block with index 4       // left green upright\n  Step14: Move block with index 4       // right green upright\n  Step15: Move block with index 6       // yellow “window” top bar\n  Step16: Move block with index 3       // green block on top\n  Step17: Move block with index 13      // orange triangular roof piece in the window\n  Step18: Move block with index 1       // blue block on the very top\n}\n\nThat completes the structure exactly as pictured in the main target image.",

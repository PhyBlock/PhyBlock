        "content": "Below is one systematic way to “rebuild” the scene using only the exact shapes/orientations from the second (dictionary) image.  First, here is how the target structure can be analyzed:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) OVERALL COUNT AND LAYERS\n\n•  Total Blocks Used: 17  \n   – 2 × red arch blocks  \n   – 1 × blue cube  \n   – 3 × green cubes (or 1 × tall green plus 1 × green cube)  \n   – 2 × orange cubes  \n   – 2 × tall yellow prisms  \n   – 2 × yellow half‐cylinders  \n   – 5 × orange wedges (for side “ramps” at ground‐level and the three “roofs”)  \n\n•  Layering (bottom to top):  \n   – Bottom layer has the two red arches in the center (forming a double‐arch “bridge”) with an orange wedge on each outer edge.  \n   – Above the left arch is a blue cube (with an orange wedge roof).  \n   – Above the right arch is a two‐cube‐high orange tower (again with an orange wedge roof).  \n   – Behind the arches, a single green cube sits in the middle, and behind that sit two tall yellow blocks side by side, topped by two yellow half‐cylinders.  \n   – On the far right is a green tower two cubes high, also topped by an orange wedge.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) WHICH DICTIONARY BLOCKS MATCH?\n\nBelow are the dictionary indices (from your second image) that match each piece exactly (no rotations allowed other than what is shown):\n\n• Red arches (front‐to‐back curved opening):  use index 2  \n  – Need 2 of these to create the double‐arch base.  \n\n• Blue cube (small blue block):  index 4  \n  – Need 1 of these for the left tower.  \n\n• Green cubes (small green block):  index 5  \n  – Need 3 total if you want two stacked for the right tower plus one in the middle behind the arches.  \n  – Alternatively, you can use one tall green block (index 7) for the right tower and one green cube (index 5) in the middle.  \n\n• Orange cubes (small orange block):  index 6  \n  – Need 2 of these for the center (orange) tower (stacked).  \n\n• Tall yellow prisms:  index 8  \n  – Need 2 of these side by side behind the green cube.  \n\n• Yellow half‐cylinders (laid horizontally):  index 10  \n  – Need 2 of these on top of the two tall yellow prisms.  \n\n• Orange wedges (the triangular “roof”/“ramp” pieces): indices 13–16  \n  – You will need 5 wedges in various orientations:  \n    – One on the far‐left ground (the left “ramp”).  \n    – One on the far‐right ground (the right “ramp”).  \n    – Three serving as roofs (left tower, center orange tower, right tower).  \n  You may reuse the same wedge‐index for repeated placements only if its orientation in the dictionary image matches how it appears in the target.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) ASSEMBLY ORDER\n\nA convenient bottom‐to‐top sequence (you can vary, but here is one example):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 13    (left‐side orange wedge at ground)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 14    (right‐side orange wedge at ground)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 2     (first red arch)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 2     (second red arch)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 4     (blue cube on left arch)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 15    (orange wedge roof for left tower)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 5     (green cube behind arches)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 8     (first tall yellow prism)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 8     (second tall yellow prism)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 10    (first yellow half‐cylinder)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 10    (second yellow half‐cylinder)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 6     (first orange cube of center tower)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 6     (second orange cube of center tower)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 16    (orange wedge roof for center tower)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 5     (bottom green cube for right tower)  \n  Step16: Move block with index 5     (top green cube for right tower)  \n  Step17: Move block with index 13    (orange wedge roof for right tower)\n}\n\nFollowing the above selection of parts and the build order will yield the same overall shape, color‐placements, and orientations seen in the target image.",

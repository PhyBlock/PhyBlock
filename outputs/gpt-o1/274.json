The final build uses a total of 10 blocks arranged into two separate “towers.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n•  Overall there are two separate structures:\n\n  LEFT STRUCTURE (4 blocks total):\n   –  Top & Bottom:  Two identical red “arch” pieces stacked vertically to form a circular hole in the center.  \n   –  Middle:  A green horizontal block runs across the hole.  \n   –  Center:  A blue cube sits in the middle of that hole (embedded in line with the green block).  \n   Visually it looks like a red rectangular prism with a cylindrical opening through which the green and blue blocks pass.\n\n  RIGHT STRUCTURE (6 blocks total):\n   –  Bottom Layer:  A tall green rectangular post standing upright.  \n   –  Second Layer:  A wide yellow rectangular beam laid horizontally on top of the green post.  \n   –  Third Layer:  A red arch block centered on the yellow beam (arch facing forward).  \n   –  Fourth Layer:  A red rectangular block on top of the arch (from the front it appears solid red).  \n   –  Roof Layer:  Two orange triangular blocks meeting at the peak, forming a “roof” shape.\n\n•  Layer Counts:\n   –  Left structure has 3 “horizontal” layers (top arch / middle band / bottom arch).  \n   –  Right structure effectively has 5 layers (green column / yellow beam / red arch / red rectangle / orange roof pair).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS & THEIR INDICES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow are the exact Dictionary indices that match the shape, color, and **orientation** needed:\n\nLEFT STRUCTURE (4 blocks):\n • Red “side‐arch” block (index 4), used twice  \n • Green short rectangular block (index 7)  \n • Blue cube (index 5)\n\nRIGHT STRUCTURE (6 blocks):\n • Tall green rectangular block (index 8)  \n • Wide yellow horizontal block (index 12)  \n • Red arch block facing front (index 1)  \n • Red rectangular block with side arch (index 2) – from the front it appears rectangular  \n • Two orange triangular “roof” wedges (indices 14 and 15)\n\nNote that we are reusing index 4 twice on the left, and that the same block index may appear multiple times in one build.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP-BY-STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 4    (Place the bottom red arch for the left structure)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 7    (Lay the green horizontal block across that arch)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 5    (Insert the blue cube into the center hole)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 4    (Stack the second red arch block on top, completing the left structure)\n\n  Step5:  Move block with index 8    (Stand the tall green post for the right structure)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 12   (Lay the yellow beam on top of the green post)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 1    (Center the red arch on the yellow beam)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 2    (Place the red rectangular block on top of the arch)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 14   (Attach the first orange roof piece)\n  Step10: Move block with index 15   (Attach the second orange roof piece to complete the roof)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps yields the two‐part arrangement exactly as in the Target Image.",

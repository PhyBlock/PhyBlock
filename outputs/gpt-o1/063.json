You may of course position them carefully so that the arches and beams align exactly:\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 1\n  Step3: Move block with index 1\n  Step4: Move block with index 10\n  Step5: Move block with index 8\n  Step6: Move block with index 8\n  Step7: Move block with index 10\n  Step8: Move block with index 13\n}",

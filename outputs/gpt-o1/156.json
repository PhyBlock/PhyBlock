        "content": "**Analysis of the Main (Target) Image**\n\nThe target consists of two separate “towers,” for a total of **16** blocks:\n\n• **Left Tower (9 blocks)**\n  1) **Bottom layer:** three red arch‐style blocks side by side.  \n  2) **Second layer:** one red arch block in the center (above the middle arch below) with a short green rectangular block set just behind it.  \n  3) **Third layer:** two tall green “column” blocks standing side by side on top of (and spanning) the red arch.  \n  4) **Fourth layer:** one wide yellow rectangular block bridging the tops of the two green columns.  \n  5) **Top piece:** an orange wedge forming a roof.\n\n• **Right Tower (7 blocks)**\n  1) **Bottom layer:** one large red arch block.  \n  2) **Above that:** a short green rectangular block.  \n  3) **Middle layer:** two yellow half‐cylinders side by side.  \n  4) **Next layer:** another short green rectangular block.  \n  5) **Top layer:** a red arch block enclosing a small green rectangular block in its opening.\n\nAlthough each “tower” has multiple visible “tiers,” in total you see 16 distinct blocks.\n\n---\n\n## Matching Blocks From the Dictionary\n\nBelow is exactly which dictionary‐index block is used (and how many times).  No rotation other than what is shown in the dictionary was allowed.\n\n• **Red arch with underside curved** (Index 1): 3× for the base of the left tower  \n• **Red arch (“tunnel”)** (Index 3): 2× total  \n  - 1× for the mid‐layer arch in the left tower  \n  - 1× for the bottom arch of the right tower  \n• **Red arch (“tunnel”)** (Index 4): 1× for the top arch of the right tower  \n• **Green short rectangular block** (Index 5): 1× (behind the mid‐arch in the left tower)  \n• **Green short rectangular block** (Index 6): 3× (all in the right tower: one under the yellow half‐cylinders, one above them, one inside the top arch)  \n• **Tall green column** (Index 7): 2× (the two upright columns atop the left tower’s mid‐arch)  \n• **Wide yellow rectangular block** (Index 9): 1× (the “cap” on the left tower)  \n• **Yellow half‐cylinder** (Index 10): 2× (the pair in the middle of the right tower)  \n• **Orange wedge** (Index 15): 1× (the roof piece on top of the left tower)\n\n---\n\n## Assembly‐Order Instructions\n\nBelow is one possible step‐by‐step order to place each block (you may of course build each “tower” in slightly different sequences):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 1  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 1  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 5  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 3  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 7  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 7  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 9  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 15  \n  Step10: Move block with index 3  \n  Step11: Move block with index 6  \n  Step12: Move block with index 10  \n  Step13: Move block with index 10  \n  Step14: Move block with index 6  \n  Step15: Move block with index 4  \n  Step16: Move block with index 6  \n}",

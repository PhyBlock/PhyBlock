        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can “read” the target picture and then select and order the dictionary blocks so as to build exactly the two structures shown (the small “rocket” on the left and the taller “tower” on the right).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n•  Overall there are TWO separate builds:\n\n  A) ROCKET‐LIKE BUILD (left side)\n     – Total of 10 blocks, arranged in essentially three “vertical” layers:\n       1) Base layer: Four orange wedges around the bottom plus four small blue rectangular blocks forming a ring around the center.\n       2) Middle: One upright orange cylinder rising through the ring.\n       3) Top: A single orange wedge serving as the “roof” or tip.\n\n  B) TOWER BUILD (right side)\n     – Total of 8 blocks, stacked in several layers from bottom to top:\n       1) Bottom layer: One horizontal yellow rectangular block on the floor, with two orange cylinders placed on top (forming the columns).\n       2) Middle layer: Another horizontal yellow block bridging the tops of the two orange columns, then two tall green pillars on top of that.\n       3) Top layer: A third horizontal yellow block bridging the green pillars, and finally one orange wedge acting as the roof piece.\n\n•  In sum, the entire scene has 18 total blocks (10 in the rocket and 8 in the tower).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING THE REQUIRED DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow are the dictionary‐block indices (referring to the second image) that match each needed shape/orientation WITHOUT rotating them any further.\n\nA) ROCKET BUILD (10 blocks total)\n\n  – Orange Cylinder (1×)\n    • Index 10 (the orange cylinder)\n\n  – Blue Ring Blocks (4×)\n    • Index 2 (blue rectangular block laid flat)\n\n  – Orange Wedges Around Base (4×)\n    • Index 11 (orange wedge in the correct “base” orientation)\n\n  – Orange “Roof” Wedge (1×)\n    • Index 12 (orange wedge oriented “point‐up” for the rocket tip)\n\nB) TOWER BUILD (8 blocks total)\n\n  – Yellow Horizontal Blocks (3×)\n    • Index 6 (yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation)\n\n  – Orange Cylinders / Columns (2×)\n    • Index 10 (same orange cylinder as above)\n\n  – Tall Green Pillars (2×)\n    • Index 5 (tall green rectangular block)\n\n  – Orange Roof Wedge (1×)\n    • Index 15 (orange wedge oriented suitably “point‐up” as the tower roof)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is one logical way to place the blocks in sequence (you may of course reorder provided the final arrangement stays the same):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 10   (place the rocket’s orange cylinder)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 2    (first blue ring piece around cylinder)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 2    (second blue ring piece)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 2    (third blue ring piece)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 2    (fourth blue ring piece)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 11   (1st orange wedge at rocket base)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 11   (2nd orange wedge at rocket base)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 11   (3rd orange wedge at rocket base)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 11   (4th orange wedge at rocket base)\n  Step10: Move block with index 12   (orange wedge on top of rocket)\n\n  Step11: Move block with index 6    (yellow block on floor under tower)\n  Step12: Move block with index 10   (1st orange cylinder / column)\n  Step13: Move block with index 10   (2nd orange cylinder / column)\n  Step14: Move block with index 6    (yellow block bridging the two columns)\n  Step15: Move block with index 5    (1st tall green pillar)\n  Step16: Move block with index 5    (2nd tall green pillar)\n  Step17: Move block with index 6    (top yellow block bridging green pillars)\n  Step18: Move block with index 15   (orange wedge as tower roof)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps with exactly these blocks/orientations reproduces the two structures shown in the target image without any further rotation of the dictionary pieces.",

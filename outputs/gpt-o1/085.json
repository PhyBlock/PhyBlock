Lay four yellow blocks (index 9) in a ring for the base.  \n2.  Place four quarter‐circle red blocks (2 × index 2, 2 × index 3) on top to form the circular hole.  \n3.  Add another ring of four yellow blocks (index 9).  \n4.  Build the next layer with one blue cube (index 4) and three red cubes (index 5).  \n5.  Arrange four small green rectangular blocks (index 7) to make the “belt.”  \n6.  Top it off with four orange wedges (indices 13, 14, 15, 16) to form the square‐based pyramid roof.",

        "content": "**1)  Description of the Target Image**\n\nThere are two separate “buildings” in the scene:\n\n• **Left‐hand Building**  \n  – **Total of 8 blocks** arranged in four main “levels.”  \n  – **Bottom Layer:** Two red arch‐shaped supports (one on the far left, one on the far right) and a red arch block bridging across the center.  \n  – **Second Layer:** A long, yellow rectangular plank running horizontally on top of the arches.  \n  – **Third Layer:** A small yellow rectangular block set in the middle, with a red cube resting above it.  \n  – **Top (Roof) Layer:** Two orange triangular wedges meeting at the peak to form a roof.  \n\n• **Right‐hand Building**  \n  – **Total of 6 blocks** arranged in three main vertical levels.  \n  – **Center Tower:** Two green cubes stacked one atop the other.  \n  – **Base Triangles (Left/Right):** One orange triangular wedge on each side at the bottom of the tower.  \n  – **Roof Triangles:** A pair of orange triangular wedges meeting on top to form a pointed roof.\n\nIn total, there are 14 blocks used across the two structures.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**2)  Selecting the Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\nBelow is the exact list of dictionary blocks (by index) needed.  Note that some blocks appear multiple times (e.g., three copies of block #2 for the arches, two copies of block #7 for the green cubes, etc.).  These must all be used in **exactly** the orientation shown in the dictionary image (no re‐orienting):\n\n• **Red Arch Block (#2):** 3 copies  \n• **Red Cube (#8):** 1 copy  \n\n• **Yellow Small Rectangular Block (#9):** 1 copy  \n• **Yellow Long Plank (#10):** 1 copy  \n\n• **Green Cube (#7):** 2 copies  \n\n• **Orange Triangular Wedges** (used in pairs to form roofs or base supports):  \n   – #13: 2 copies total  \n   – #14: 2 copies total  \n   – #15: 1 copy  \n   – #16: 1 copy  \n\n(This yields 14 total pieces in the same orientation shown in the dictionary.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**3)  Step‐by‐Step Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one possible sequence building from the ground up.  The first eight steps assemble the left‐hand building; the final steps assemble the right‐hand building.\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 2   (left bottom arch)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 2   (right bottom arch)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 2   (center arch bridging the first two)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 10  (long yellow plank across arches)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 9   (small yellow rectangular block in center)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 8   (red cube atop the yellow block)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 13  (left orange roof wedge)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 14  (right orange roof wedge)  \n\n  Step9:  Move block with index 7   (bottom green cube for right tower)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 7   (second green cube stacked above)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 15  (orange triangular wedge at bottom left)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 16  (orange triangular wedge at bottom right)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 13  (top orange wedge, left side of roof)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 14  (top orange wedge, right side of roof)  \n}\n\nFollowing these steps (and reusing indices exactly as listed) reproduces the target layout as shown.",

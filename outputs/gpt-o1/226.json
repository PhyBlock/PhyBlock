        "content": "Below is one systematic way to see how the two grouped “towers” in the target picture are built up, and which dictionary blocks (by index) are used.  The key observation is that all the red “arches” visible from the front are the same red block (index 2) repeated in various places (since it already has the correct front‐to‐back half‐cylinder).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\n■  Overall Count and Layers\n\n•  The left tower has 7 blocks in four “layers” (bottom row of three arches, then a blue cube, then a green bar, then one more red arch, then the small orange roof on top).  \n•  The right tower also has 7 blocks, again in four layers (three red arches on the bottom, one yellow slab above them, two red arches stacked to form the circular window, and a second yellow slab on top).  \n•  In total, there are 14 blocks.\n\n■  Spatial Layout (Left Tower from bottom to top)\n\n  1.  Bottom layer: Three red arches side by side.  \n  2.  Above the middle arch: A single small blue cube.  \n  3.  Spanning across the blue cube: A green rectangular block (placed horizontally).  \n  4.  Resting on that green block: Another red arch.  \n  5.  Capping the top: An orange triangular “roof” block.\n\n■  Spatial Layout (Right Tower from bottom to top)\n\n  1.  Bottom layer: Three red arches side by side.  \n  2.  Above them: One yellow rectangular slab spanning the full width.  \n  3.  Above that slab: Two red arches stacked vertically to form a large circular window as seen from the front.  \n  4.  On top: Another yellow rectangular slab.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\n■  Red Arches (Index 2)  \nEvery red “arched” element you see from the front is block 2 repeated (since block 2 is the red rectangular piece with a front‐to‐back half‐cylinder).  Nine of these are needed in total:\n •  4 for the left tower (three on the bottom row, one up high),  \n •  5 for the right tower (three on the bottom row, two stacked for the circular window).\n\n■  Blue Cube (Index 6)  \nThe small blue cube in the center of the left tower is block 6.\n\n■  Green Horizontal Bar (Index 7)  \nThe green rectangular piece bridging across the top of the blue cube (left tower) is block 7 (it is already oriented horizontally in the dictionary).\n\n■  Yellow Slabs (Index 11)  \nEach yellow rectangular slab (both on the right tower) is block 11.  We use two of them total.\n\n■  Orange Roof (Index 15)  \nThe small orange triangular‐prism roof on top of the left tower is block 15 (which appears oriented correctly for that “peak” shape).\n\nHence the needed indices (with repetitions) are:\n\n•  Red block 2 (× 9)  \n•  Blue block 6 (× 1)  \n•  Green block 7 (× 1)  \n•  Yellow block 11 (× 2)  \n•  Orange block 15 (× 1)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is one possible order for placing the 14 pieces.  (You may of course group the “left tower” first and then the “right tower,” or vice versa.)\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 2   (left tower, bottom‐left arch)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 2   (left tower, bottom‐center arch)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 2   (left tower, bottom‐right arch)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 6   (blue cube on center of left tower)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 7   (green bar bridging over the cube)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 2   (red arch atop the green bar)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 15  (orange roof piece for left tower)\n\n  Step8:  Move block with index 2   (right tower, bottom‐left arch)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 2   (right tower, bottom‐center arch)\n  Step10: Move block with index 2   (right tower, bottom‐right arch)\n  Step11: Move block with index 11  (first yellow slab above the arches)\n  Step12: Move block with index 2   (red arch forming lower half of circle)\n  Step13: Move block with index 2   (red arch forming upper half of circle)\n  Step14: Move block with index 11  (second yellow slab on top)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps and using only the listed orientations (without rotating them differently) yields the exact two‐tower arrangement shown in the target image.",

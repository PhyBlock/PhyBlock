        "content": "Below is one systematic way to “decode” and rebuild the scene exactly as shown, using only the orientations given in the dictionary images (no re‐orientations).  I have broken the explanation into three parts:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n•  Overall there are two separate structures:\n\n  A)  The “Truck” (left side in the image)\n     –  Layers & Block Count:\n        1.  A single yellow rectangular prism as the main chassis (appears as one thick yellow layer).  \n        2.  On top at the rear is a green rectangular block.  \n        3.  On top at the front are two cubes side‐by‐side (one blue and one red), capped by a yellow half‐cylinder “roof.”  \n        4.  Two orange cylinders (lying horizontally) serve as wheels.\n     –  Thus the truck uses 7 pieces total:\n        •  1 × yellow rectangular block (chassis)  \n        •  1 × green rectangular block (rear bed)  \n        •  1 × blue cube  \n        •  1 × red cube  \n        •  1 × yellow half‐cylinder (roof)  \n        •  2 × orange horizontal cylinders (wheels)\n\n  B)  The “Arch‐Tower” (right side in the image)\n     –  Layers & Block Count (bottom to top):\n        1.  Bottom layer of three red arch‐blocks side by side (forming three arches across the front).  \n        2.  One flat yellow rectangular block spanning the entire second layer.  \n        3.  A red “circular window” section made from two matching red half‐circle blocks (stacked vertically) so as to form a complete large circular hole through the middle.  \n        4.  A second flat yellow rectangular block capping the top.  \n     –  Hence the tower uses 7 pieces total:\n        •  3 × red arch blocks (for the base arches)  \n        •  1 × yellow rectangular block (mid‐level)  \n        •  2 × red “C‐shape” pieces (stacked to form the circular window)  \n        •  1 × yellow rectangular block (top level)\n\n•  Total Blocks Used in the Scene = 7 (truck) + 7 (tower) = 14.  \n•  Number of Layers:  \n  –  The truck effectively has 2 main layers (chassis layer + top cubes/roof), with wheels attached at the base.  \n  –  The tower has 4 “layers” (arch base → yellow slab → circular window → yellow top).  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2)  MATCHING EACH PART TO THE DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is one possible exact match from the dictionary without rotating any piece:\n\n●  TRUCK\n   1)  Yellow chassis   → use block #10 (a flat yellow rectangular prism oriented long‐ways).  \n   2)  Green rear block  → use block #8 (short green rectangular prism).  \n   3)  Blue cube         → block #5.  \n   4)  Red cube          → block #7.  \n   5)  Yellow half‐cyl.  → block #15 (the half‐cylinder in yellow, lying “east‐west”).  \n   6)  Orange wheels     → block #14 (the orange cylinder lying horizontally).  We need two of these, so #14 is used twice.\n\n●  ARCH‐TOWER\n   1)  Red base arches   → block #1 three times (all oriented as arches front‐to‐back).  \n   2)  Yellow mid‐slab   → block #11 (a slightly longer yellow rectangular prism, also oriented lengthwise).  \n   3)  Red circular hole → block #4 twice (two matching “C‐shapes,” stacked to form the large round opening).  \n   4)  Yellow top slab   → block #12 (another yellow rectangular prism, also lengthwise).\n\nHence the indices needed are:\n\n- (Truck)  #10, #8, #5, #7, #15, #14×2  \n- (Tower)  #1×3, #11, #4×2, #12  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is one logical sequence (you can assemble tower first or truck first—any order works).  Here is an example tower‐then‐truck order:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 1      // 1st red arch (tower base)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 1      // 2nd red arch (tower base)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 1      // 3rd red arch (tower base)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 11     // yellow rectangle above arches\n  Step5:  Move block with index 4      // bottom half of the circular window\n  Step6:  Move block with index 4      // top half of the circular window\n  Step7:  Move block with index 12     // yellow rectangle on top\n\n  Step8:  Move block with index 10     // truck’s yellow chassis\n  Step9:  Move block with index 8      // green rectangular block (rear of truck)\n  Step10: Move block with index 5      // blue cube (truck front)\n  Step11: Move block with index 7      // red cube (truck front)\n  Step12: Move block with index 15     // yellow half-cylinder (truck roof)\n  Step13: Move block with index 14     // first orange cylinder (wheel)\n  Step14: Move block with index 14     // second orange cylinder (wheel)\n}\n\nThat completes the build exactly as shown in the reference image, using only the unrotated blocks from the dictionary.",

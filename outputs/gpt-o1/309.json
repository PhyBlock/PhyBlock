        "content": "Below is one systematic way to “re‐create” the exact scene from the two reference images.  I have broken the solution into the three required parts: (1) a careful description of the target build, (2) which dictionary blocks (by index) must be used (and how many of each), and (3) one possible step‐by‐step assembly order using the required indices “as‐is” (no rotations).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN TARGET STRUCTURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  Overall Count and Layers  \n   – The scene as shown uses a total of 20 blocks.  \n   – They form two main groupings:  \n       1.  The “castle” in the left/middle (15 blocks).  \n       2.  The large red “ring” on the right with a green bar through its center (5 blocks).  \n\n•  Castle (Front/Middle)  \n   1.  Bottom Row (5 blocks)  \n       – Three red arches form the middle front “bridge” (#1 used three times).  \n       – An orange wedge at the far left and another orange wedge at the far right (#14 on the left, #15 on the right).  \n   2.  Towers and Roofs (5 blocks)  \n       – Left tower: one blue cube (#4) below, topped by a red roof piece (#2).  \n       – Right tower: one orange cube (#6) below, also topped by a red roof piece (#2).  \n   3.  Behind the Arches (5 blocks)  \n       – Two tall green rectangular blocks (#8 used twice) stand behind the left and right arches.  \n       – Two yellow half‐cylinders (#11 used twice) span across the tops of the arches in the center.  \n       – Two tall yellow pillars (#10 used twice) stand still farther back (they are visible protruding above the structure).  \n\n•  Large Red Ring (Right Side) (5 blocks)  \n   – Formed by four red “quarter‐ring” pieces (#3 used four times) assembled in their dictionary orientations (no rotation).  \n   – A short green rectangular block (#7) passes horizontally through the ring’s center.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  BLOCK‐INDEX LIST & QUANTITIES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  #1: Red arch block → 3 copies  \n•  #2: Red “roof”/“cap” block → 2 copies  \n•  #3: Red quarter‐ring block → 4 copies (forming the large ring at right)  \n•  #4: Blue cube → 1 copy  \n•  #6: Orange cube → 1 copy  \n•  #7: Green rectangular (short/horizontal) → 1 copy  \n•  #8: Green rectangular (tall/vertical) → 2 copies  \n•  #10: Tall yellow rectangular block → 2 copies  \n•  #11: Yellow half‐cylinder → 2 copies  \n•  #14: Orange wedge (left‐leaning) → 1 copy  \n•  #15: Orange wedge (right‐leaning) → 1 copy  \n\nNo other indices are used.  Note that each block must be used exactly in the orientation shown in the dictionary (no re‐orientations).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  EXAMPLE STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n{  \n  Step1: Move block with index 14   // left orange wedge  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1    // first red arch  \n  Step3: Move block with index 1    // second red arch  \n  Step4: Move block with index 1    // third red arch  \n  Step5: Move block with index 15   // right orange wedge  \n  Step6: Move block with index 4    // blue cube (left tower base)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 2    // red roof on blue cube  \n  Step8: Move block with index 6    // orange cube (right tower base)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 2    // red roof on orange cube  \n  Step10: Move block with index 8   // green block behind left arch  \n  Step11: Move block with index 8   // green block behind right arch  \n  Step12: Move block with index 11  // first yellow half‐cylinder  \n  Step13: Move block with index 11  // second yellow half‐cylinder  \n  Step14: Move block with index 10  // tall yellow pillar  \n  Step15: Move block with index 10  // tall yellow pillar  \n  Step16: Move block with index 3   // quarter‐ring piece (ring part)  \n  Step17: Move block with index 3   // quarter‐ring piece (ring part)  \n  Step18: Move block with index 3   // quarter‐ring piece (ring part)  \n  Step19: Move block with index 3   // quarter‐ring piece (ring part)  \n  Step20: Move block with index 7   // green horizontal bar through ring  \n}  \n\nFollowing the above order (or any similar sequence) will yield the same final arrangement as in the main target image—matching colors, shapes, and orientations exactly as they appear in the dictionary.",

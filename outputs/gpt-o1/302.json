        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n1. **Overall Layout and Block Count**\n\n   The scene actually contains **two separate “mini‐structures.”**  \n   - **Left Structure (5 blocks total)**  \n     - **Bottom:** Two tall green rectangular prisms standing side by side.  \n     - **Above those:** One long yellow rectangular block bridging across the two green blocks.  \n     - **On top:** A vertical orange cylinder, capped by a yellow half‐cylindrical block.  \n   - **Right Structure (4 blocks total)**  \n     - **Bottom:** Two red arches placed side by side.  \n     - **Above those:** One long yellow rectangular block bridging the two arches.  \n     - **On top:** A yellow half‐cylindrical block.  \n\n   In total, there are **9 blocks** used (5 in the left group + 4 in the right group).\n\n2. **Layering / “Stack Height”**  \n   - **Left group** has four “layers”:  \n     1) Green pillars (2 blocks)  \n     2) Yellow bridging rectangle  \n     3) Orange cylinder  \n     4) Yellow half‐cylinder  \n   - **Right group** has three “layers”:  \n     1) Red arches (2 blocks)  \n     2) Yellow bridging rectangle  \n     3) Yellow half‐cylinder  \n\n3. **Adjacencies and Spatial Relationships**  \n   - **Left:** The two tall green pillars stand upright next to each other so that the long yellow block spans them. The orange cylinder stands on that yellow block toward one end, with the yellow half‐cylinder resting on top of the orange cylinder.  \n   - **Right:** The two red arches are placed so that the same long yellow block spans both. A yellow half‐cylindrical piece then sits on top, centered.  \n\n---\n\n## Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nMatching each color, shape, and **exact** orientation from the second image yields:\n\n1. **Red Arches:** Dictionary block **#2** (the arch oriented with its opening front‐to‐back).  \n   - Used **twice** (the two matching arches on the right structure).  \n\n2. **Green Rectangular Pillars:** Dictionary block **#5** (tall green rectangular prism with its wide face “forward,” as seen).  \n   - Used **twice** (the two upright green blocks on the left structure).  \n\n3. **Long Yellow Rectangular Block:** Dictionary block **#10** (the horizontally oriented yellow rectangle).  \n   - Used **twice** (one bridging the green pillars, another bridging the red arches).  \n\n4. **Orange Cylinder:** Dictionary block **#11** (the vertical orange cylinder).  \n   - Used **once** (on top of the yellow block in the left structure).  \n\n5. **Yellow Half‐Cylinder (horizontal left‐to‐right):** Dictionary block **#12**.  \n   - Used **twice** (one capping the orange cylinder on the left structure, another on top of the yellow block of the right structure).  \n\n**In summary,** the indices (with repeats) are:  \n• #2 × 2  \n• #5 × 2  \n• #10 × 2  \n• #11 × 1  \n• #12 × 2  \n\n---\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBelow is one possible step‐by‐step sequence (you may group them by structure or interleave as desired). The required output format is:\n\n{\n Step1: Move block with index X  \n Step2: Move block with index Y  \n ...\n}\n\nHere is a straightforward bottom‐to‐top build:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 5    // First green pillar (left structure)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 5    // Second green pillar (left structure)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 10   // Yellow bridging block on green pillars  \n  Step4: Move block with index 11   // Orange cylinder on top of that yellow block  \n  Step5: Move block with index 12   // Half‐cylinder capping the orange cylinder  \n\n  Step6: Move block with index 2    // First red arch (right structure)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 2    // Second red arch (right structure)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 10   // Yellow bridging block on red arches  \n  Step9: Move block with index 12   // Half‐cylinder on top of that yellow block  \n}",

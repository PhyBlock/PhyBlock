        "content": "Analysis of the Target Structure\n--------------------------------\nFrom the photograph, the model naturally divides into two sub‐assemblies:\n\n• A “cart” on the left, with two horizontal cylindrical “wheels,” a flat yellow platform, and two small cubes (one red, one blue) sitting on top.  \n• A “temple” on the right, built on a yellow base, with four vertical orange columns, another yellow block bridging the columns, a red arch in front, and two red “roof” wedges forming a pitched top.\n\nCounting and Layers  \n• Total Blocks: 14 pieces.  \n   – Cart uses 5 blocks.  \n   – Temple uses 9 blocks.  \n• Layers:  \n   – Cart has essentially two layers: the yellow platform (layer 1) with two cubes on top (layer 2), plus wheels underneath.  \n   – Temple has three layers:  \n       1) A yellow base on the floor,  \n       2) Four orange columns supporting a second yellow block,  \n       3) A red arch plus two wedges forming the roof.\n\nWhich Dictionary Blocks Are Used?\n---------------------------------\nBelow are the indices (from the Block Dictionary image) and how many times each is needed.  Note that the same index can be used multiple times, and no rotation other than as shown is allowed.\n\nCart (5 blocks total)\n• Index 8 (yellow rectangular block), used once for the cart’s flat platform.  \n• Index 11 (orange cylinder, horizontal), used twice for the two wheels.  \n• Index 4 (blue cube), used once.  \n• Index 6 (red cube), used once.\n\nTemple (9 blocks total)\n• Index 8 (yellow rectangular block), used twice (one for the base, one spanning the tops of the columns).  \n• Index 10 (orange cylinder, vertical), used four times for the columns.  \n• Index 1 (red arch), used once at the center of the top.  \n• Index 14 and Index 15 (red/orange wedges), one each to form the two halves of the pitched roof.\n\nProposed Assembly Order\n-----------------------\nUse the following steps (in a JSON‐like format) to place each piece from bottom to top:\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 8       (temple base)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 10      (temple column 1)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 10      (temple column 2)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 10      (temple column 3)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 10      (temple column 4)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 8       (temple top spanning the columns)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 1       (red arch on top)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 14      (left wedge of roof)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 15      (right wedge of roof)\n\n  Step10: Move block with index 8       (cart platform)\n  Step11: Move block with index 11      (cart wheel 1)\n  Step12: Move block with index 11      (cart wheel 2)\n  Step13: Move block with index 4       (blue cube)\n  Step14: Move block with index 6       (red cube)\n}\n\nFollowing these steps with the indicated blocks (exactly in their dictionary orientations) will reproduce the target structure as shown.",

        "content": "**Analysis of the Main Target Image**\n\n1. **Overall Count and Layers**\n\n   - The model actually consists of **two separate sub‐structures** (a “castle” on the left and a “house” on the right), for a total of **12 blocks** overall.  \n   - **Left (Castle) Sub‐Structure** uses 8 blocks arranged in essentially two vertical layers (arches/columns below, half‐cylinders on top).  \n   - **Right (House) Sub‐Structure** uses 4 blocks stacked in four layers (arch at bottom, then green block, then blue cube, then triangular roof).\n\n2. **Spatial Arrangement**\n\n   - **Left/“Castle”**  \n     • Front row has **2 red arch blocks** side by side.  \n     • Directly behind each arch lies a **short green rectangular block**; behind each green block is a **tall yellow rectangular column**.  \n     • On top of the two arches (spanning across their tops) sit **2 yellow half‐cylinders** side by side.  \n\n   - **Right/“House”**  \n     • The bottom layer is a **single red arch block**.  \n     • Above the arch is one **short green rectangular block** that covers roughly the same footprint.  \n     • Above the green block is a **blue cube**.  \n     • Topping it all is an **orange triangular block** forming the “roof.”\n\n---\n\n**Selecting Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\nBelow are the dictionary indices that match the **exact orientation and color** seen in the target:\n\n- **Red arch (front‐view opening)** → **Index 1**  \n  • Used 3 times total (2 in the left “castle,” 1 in the right “house”).  \n- **Short green rectangular block** → **Index 6**  \n  • Used 3 times total (2 in the left structure, 1 in the right).  \n- **Tall yellow rectangular column** → **Index 11**  \n  • Used 2 times (both columns in the left “castle”).  \n- **Yellow half‐cylinder (curve visible from the front)** → **Index 12**  \n  • Used 2 times (the two half‐cylinders across the castle’s top).  \n- **Blue cube** → **Index 3**  \n  • Used once (right‐structure middle).  \n- **Orange triangular roof (ridge runs left–right)** → **Index 16**  \n  • Used once (right‐structure top).\n\nHence the needed block indices and their quantities are:\n\n• 1 (×3), 3 (×1), 6 (×3), 11 (×2), 12 (×2), 16 (×1).\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nBelow is one logical step‐by‐step sequence (you may group or reorder if desired, but this illustrates a straightforward bottom‐up build):\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1       (left castle, first red arch)  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1       (left castle, second red arch)  \n  Step3: Move block with index 6       (left castle, first green block behind an arch)  \n  Step4: Move block with index 6       (left castle, second green block behind an arch)  \n  Step5: Move block with index 11      (left castle, first tall yellow column)  \n  Step6: Move block with index 11      (left castle, second tall yellow column)  \n  Step7: Move block with index 12      (left castle, first yellow half‐cylinder on arches)  \n  Step8: Move block with index 12      (left castle, second yellow half‐cylinder on arches)  \n  Step9: Move block with index 1       (right house, red arch base)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 6      (right house, green block above arch)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 3      (right house, blue cube above green)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 16     (right house, orange triangular roof)\n}",

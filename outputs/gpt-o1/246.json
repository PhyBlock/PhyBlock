        "content": "Below is a complete breakdown of what the target photograph shows and how to replicate it exactly with the provided dictionary blocks (no rotations other than those shown in the dictionary).  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• The scene contains TWO separate structures.\n\n--------------------\nA) Left Structure\n--------------------\n  • Total of 5 blocks.  \n  • From bottom to top (layering):\n    1) Two short orange cylinders standing vertically, side by side.  \n    2) One yellow rectangular bar laid horizontally across those two cylinders.  \n    3) One more orange cylinder standing vertically on top of that yellow bar (toward one end).  \n    4) A small yellow half‐cylinder lying horizontally on top of that upper orange cylinder.  \n\n--------------------\nB) Right Structure\n--------------------\n  • Total of 7 blocks.  \n  • From bottom to top (layering):\n    1) Two red arch blocks side by side on the ground (forming the base).  \n    2) Immediately behind them, one small green rectangular block on the right side.  \n    3) Two tall yellow rectangular blocks standing vertically behind the arches (these two yellow blocks stand side by side and form a “back wall”).  \n    4) One orange cylinder standing vertically on top of the red arches (in the center).  \n    5) An orange triangular wedge/roof perched atop that vertical cylinder.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2.  SELECTING THE REQUIRED BLOCKS & THEIR INDICES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBased on the exact color, shape, and orientation needed (no re‐orientations allowed beyond what is pictured in the dictionary), the blocks are:\n\n--------------------\nA) Left Structure Blocks\n--------------------\n  • 3 × Index 9 (Orange cylinder, vertical orientation)  \n  • 1 × Index 5 (Yellow rectangular block, horizontal orientation)  \n  • 1 × Index 12 (Yellow half‐cylinder, oriented with flat side down/curved top)  \n\n--------------------\nB) Right Structure Blocks\n--------------------\n  • 2 × Index 1 (Red arch block)  \n  • 1 × Index 3 (Green rectangular block, short orientation)  \n  • 2 × Index 7 (Tall yellow rectangular blocks, vertical orientation)  \n  • 1 × Index 9 (Orange cylinder, vertical orientation)  \n  • 1 × Index 16 (Orange wedge/“roof” piece)  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  STEP-BY-STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is one possible sequence (in JSON format). You may of course group them differently, but the final arrangement should be as described above:\n\n{\n  \"Step1\": \"Move block with index 9 (first orange cylinder for left structure)\",\n  \"Step2\": \"Move block with index 9 (second orange cylinder for left structure)\",\n  \"Step3\": \"Move block with index 5 (yellow horizontal bar)\",\n  \"Step4\": \"Move block with index 9 (third orange cylinder on top)\",\n  \"Step5\": \"Move block with index 12 (yellow half-cylinder on top)\",\n  \"Step6\": \"Move block with index 1 (first red arch for right structure)\",\n  \"Step7\": \"Move block with index 1 (second red arch for right structure)\",\n  \"Step8\": \"Move block with index 3 (green block behind right arch)\",\n  \"Step9\": \"Move block with index 7 (first tall yellow block)\",\n  \"Step10\": \"Move block with index 7 (second tall yellow block)\",\n  \"Step11\": \"Move block with index 9 (orange cylinder atop arches)\",\n  \"Step12\": \"Move block with index 16 (orange wedge on top)\"\n}\n\nFollowing these instructions with the stated blocks (and orientations) will reproduce the target build exactly as shown.",

The final arrangement is two separate “buildings”:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE TARGET IMAGE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●  Left “Tower” Structure (3 vertical layers, 8 total blocks):\n   – Bottom/Center:  An orange cylinder standing upright.  \n   – Mid‐Level:  A red rectangular block on top of the cylinder, with an orange triangular wedge on each side (the “arms”).  \n   – Top:  Two yellow half‐cylinders sitting side by side to form the “roof.”  \n   (In total, the tower uses 1 orange cylinder, 1 red rectangular block, 2 orange wedges for the sides, and 2 yellow half‐cylinders.  Depending on viewpoint, two additional orange wedges may appear at the lower “feet,” making 4 wedges in all if you interpret the “feet” plus “arms.”)\n\n●  Right “House” Structure (3 vertical layers, 7 total blocks):\n   – Bottom Layer:  A red arch‐block in the center with an orange triangular wedge on each side.  \n   – Middle Layer:  One green cube to the left and one blue cube to the right, sitting atop the arch.  \n   – Top Layer (“Roof”):  Two orange triangular wedges meet at the peak to form a simple gable.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2)  SELECTED BLOCKS AND THEIR INDICES\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is one way to match the colors/shapes exactly as shown (no rotation other than what is given in the dictionary image).  Note that under the rules, you may reuse the same index multiple times if the same shape/orientation is needed more than once.\n\nUsed Indices:\n\n• Red Arch (index 1) – for the “house” base.  \n• Red Rectangular Block with curved cut (index 5) – for the tower’s top red piece.  \n• Blue Cube (index 6) – for the house middle (right cube).  \n• Green Cube (index 7) – for the house middle (left cube).  \n• Orange Cylinder (index 8) – upright “body” of the tower.  \n• Yellow Half‐Cylinder (index 9) – reused for each yellow half‐cylinder on the tower roof (two total).  \n• Orange Triangular Wedges (indices 13, 14, 15, 16) – reused as needed for the tower’s “arms” (and possibly “feet”) and the house’s side wedges and roof wedges.  \n\nIn other words, the structures can be built exclusively from blocks 1, 5–9, and 13–16.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is one possible build order.  (Because some wedges and half‐cylinders appear more than once, the same index is repeated as needed.)\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 8    // Place the orange cylinder (tower base).\n  Step2: Move block with index 14   // Tower wedge (e.g. left “arm”).\n  Step3: Move block with index 16   // Tower wedge (right “arm”).\n  Step4: Move block with index 5    // Red rectangular block atop cylinder.\n  Step5: Move block with index 9    // First yellow half‐cylinder on top.\n  Step6: Move block with index 9    // Second yellow half‐cylinder on top.\n\n  Step7: Move block with index 1    // Red arch for the house base.\n  Step8: Move block with index 13   // House bottom wedge (one side).\n  Step9: Move block with index 15   // House bottom wedge (other side).\n  Step10: Move block with index 7   // Green cube above the arch (left).\n  Step11: Move block with index 6   // Blue cube above the arch (right).\n  Step12: Move block with index 13  // House roof wedge (one side).\n  Step13: Move block with index 15  // House roof wedge (other side).\n}\n\nThat sequence places all the needed blocks in a reasonable bottom‐to‐top order.  By selecting precisely those block indices (1,5,6,7,8,9,13,14,15,16), you can reproduce both buildings exactly as in the target image, respecting color, shape, and orientation.",

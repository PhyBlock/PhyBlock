From bottom to top (counting each cube‐height as a “layer”), the structure is 5 layers tall:  \n    1)  A green rectangular “plate” on the bottom.  \n    2)  A red cube (right side) and the bottom portion of two tall yellow blocks (left side).  \n    3)  A blue cube (right side) and the middle portion of those two tall yellow blocks.  \n    4)  Another red cube (right side) plus the top portion of the two tall yellow blocks.  \n    5)  A green rectangular “plate” on top spanning everything.  \n\n• Spatial Relationships  \n  – The bottom and top layers are each a flat green rectangular block oriented front‐to‐back.  \n  – On the left side, there are two identical tall yellow blocks standing side by side (front‐to‐back).  \n  – In the middle/right, three cubes (red–blue–red) are stacked vertically between the bottom and top green blocks.  \n\nSelection of Required Dictionary Blocks  \n1)  Two green rectangular plates matching the front‐to‐back orientation → block #7 (twice).  \n2)  Two tall yellow vertical blocks (narrow face toward the front) → block #15 (twice).  \n3)  Three cubes for the vertical stack (2 red, 1 blue):  \n    – Red cube → block #4 (used twice)  \n    – Blue cube → block #1 (used once)  \n\nHence, the exact blocks (with their dictionary indices) needed are:  \n• #7 (green) × 2  \n• #15 (yellow) × 2  \n• #4 (red) × 2  \n• #1 (blue) × 1  \n\nAssembly Order  \n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7,\n  Step2: Move block with index 15,\n  Step3: Move block with index 15,\n  Step4: Move block with index 4,\n  Step5: Move block with index 1,\n  Step6: Move block with index 4,\n  Step7: Move block with index 7\n}",

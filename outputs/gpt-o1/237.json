        "content": "**1) Analysis of the Main (Target) Image**\n\nThe scene actually contains **two separate structures**:\n\n• **Left‐Hand Structure**  \n  – **Total of 9 blocks**  \n    1. Three orange cylinders standing upright in the center.  \n    2. Two tall green rectangular prisms (one on each side of the cylinders).  \n    3. A short green rectangular block laid horizontally across the tops of the two tall green prisms.  \n    4. Three orange triangular wedges: two are at the base on either side (leaning outward), and one is perched on top (forming a “roof” shape).  \n  – **Layering**:  Most of the mass is on a single “base layer” (the two tall green blocks + three cylinders + the two wedges at ground level).  Then, on top, there is a small green rectangular block bridging across, with one orange wedge resting on it as a roof.  \n\n• **Right‐Hand Structure**  \n  – **Total of 6 cubes** arranged in a 2‐wide × 3‐tall block‐grid when viewed from the front.  \n    – **Top row**: Green cube (left), Red cube (right)  \n    – **Middle row**: Orange cube (left), Blue cube (right)  \n    – **Bottom row**: Red cube (left), Yellow cube (right)  \n  – **Layering**: Simply three layers (rows), each layer consisting of two cubes side by side.  \n\nIn all, there are **15 total pieces** visible (9 for the left structure, 6 for the right).\n\n---\n\n**2) Selecting the Required Blocks From the Dictionary**\n\nBelow is a breakdown of which dictionary indices match each block **exactly in the orientation shown** (no rotation permitted):\n\n• **Left‐Hand Structure (9 blocks):**  \n  1. **Tall green rectangular prisms (2×)** ⇒ Block **#7** (twice)  \n  2. **Orange cylinders (3×)** ⇒ Block **#10** (three times)  \n  3. **Short green rectangular block laid flat (1×)** ⇒ Block **#6**  \n  4. **Orange triangular wedges (3×)**  \n     - Left wedge at base ⇒ Block **#15**  \n     - Right wedge at base ⇒ Block **#16**  \n     - “Roof” wedge on top ⇒ Block **#14**  \n\n• **Right‐Hand Structure (6 blocks / cubes):**  \n  1. **Blue cube (1×)** ⇒ Block **#1**  \n  2. **Green cube (1×)** ⇒ Block **#2**  \n  3. **Orange cube (1×)** ⇒ Block **#3**  \n  4. **Red cubes (2×)** ⇒ Block **#4** (used twice)  \n  5. **Yellow cube (1×)** ⇒ Block **#5**  \n\n---\n\n**3) Step‐by‐Step Assembly Order**\n\nA simple way to assemble them (you may of course vary the order if you wish) is:\n\n{  \n  Step1:  Move block with index 7   (first tall green prism)  \n  Step2:  Move block with index 15  (left orange wedge at base)  \n  Step3:  Move block with index 10  (first orange cylinder)  \n  Step4:  Move block with index 10  (second orange cylinder)  \n  Step5:  Move block with index 10  (third orange cylinder)  \n  Step6:  Move block with index 7   (second tall green prism)  \n  Step7:  Move block with index 16  (right orange wedge at base)  \n  Step8:  Move block with index 6   (short green rectangular block on top)  \n  Step9:  Move block with index 14  (orange “roof” wedge on top)  \n  Step10: Move block with index 4   (red cube for bottom row, left side)  \n  Step11: Move block with index 5   (yellow cube for bottom row, right side)  \n  Step12: Move block with index 3   (orange cube for middle row, left side)  \n  Step13: Move block with index 1   (blue cube for middle row, right side)  \n  Step14: Move block with index 2   (green cube for top row, left side)  \n  Step15: Move block with index 4   (second red cube for top row, right side)  \n}",

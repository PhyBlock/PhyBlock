A single green rectangular brick at the bottom.  \n     2. An upright orange cylinder in the middle.  \n     3. An orange “roof‐shaped” block on top.\n\n2. **Spatial Relationships**  \n   - **Layer 1 (Bottom):** The green rectangular block is placed horizontally on the ground.  \n   - **Layer 2 (Middle):** The orange cylinder stands upright, centered on top of the green block.  \n   - **Layer 3 (Top):** The orange roof‐shaped piece sits on top of the cylinder, forming a peaked “cap.”\n\n---\n\n**Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary**\n\n- **Green Base:** Matches the orientation of block index **1** (a horizontal green rectangular block).  \n- **Orange Cylinder:** Matches the orientation of block index **5** (an orange cylinder standing upright).  \n- **Orange Roof Piece:** Matches block index **8**, which is the orange roof/wedge shape as shown in the target.\n\nHence, the blocks needed are **#1**, **#5**, and **#8**.\n\n---\n\n**Assembly Order**\n\nUse the following step‐by‐step sequence to assemble the structure:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1  \n  Step2: Move block with index 5  \n  Step3: Move block with index 8  \n}",

They fit together in a low, boxy arrangement.  \n •  An orange cylinder stands behind them, supporting a red arch‐shaped block whose large half‐circle opening faces forward.  \n •  Behind (or just above) that arch is a second red “open‐topped” piece.  \n •  Finally, two yellow half‐cylinders sit side by side on top, forming a double “hump.”\n\nIn total there are two groupings with multiple layers.  The left (chair) has four layers (cylinders → seat blocks → tall green block → yellow half‐cylinder).  The right grouping has its bottom layer (the small blocks and wedge), the orange cylinder behind, then the two red arches stacked, and the pair of yellow half‐cylinders on top.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n■ 2)  Selecting the Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBelow is the complete list of needed blocks (by their dictionary index), with the exact orientation shown in the target image.  If any block repeats, it appears multiple times in the list.\n\nA)  Chair‐Like Structure\n •  #11 (orange cylinder) × 4\n •  #9  (yellow horizontal rectangular block) × 3\n •  #7  (tall green rectangular block)\n •  #13 (yellow half‐cylinder)\n\nB)  Box‐and‐Wedge Structure\n •  #3  (blue cube)\n •  #5  (small yellow rectangular block)\n •  #6  (small green rectangular block)\n •  #16 (red triangular wedge)\n •  #11 (orange cylinder)\n •  #2  (red arch block, opening forward)\n •  #1  (red arch block, opening upward)\n •  #13 (yellow half‐cylinder) × 2\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n■ 3)  Step‐by‐Step Assembly Order\n\nBelow is one possible sequence in which you might place the blocks.  (You may group the two structures as you wish, but the bottom‐layer‐first approach is shown here.)\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 11      (1st orange cylinder for chair leg)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 11      (2nd orange cylinder for chair leg)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 11      (3rd orange cylinder for chair leg)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 11      (4th orange cylinder for chair leg)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 9       (1st yellow seat block)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 9       (2nd yellow seat block)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 9       (3rd yellow seat block)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 7       (tall green backrest)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 13      (yellow half‐cylinder atop the green block)\n\n  Step10: Move block with index 3       (blue cube on ground for second structure)\n  Step11: Move block with index 5       (yellow rectangular block on ground)\n  Step12: Move block with index 6       (green rectangular block on ground)\n  Step13: Move block with index 16      (red wedge on ground)\n  Step14: Move block with index 11      (orange cylinder behind the small blocks)\n  Step15: Move block with index 2       (red arch with opening forward)\n  Step16: Move block with index 1       (red piece with open top behind/above first arch)\n  Step17: Move block with index 13      (1st yellow half‐cylinder on top)\n  Step18: Move block with index 13      (2nd yellow half‐cylinder on top)\n}",

        "content": "Below is one systematic way to “read off” exactly what is in the picture, pick out which numbered blocks match each piece (without re‐orienting them!), and then give a sensible order in which one could stack them.  Here is the full breakdown:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1)  ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN (TARGET) IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n•  Overall there are two separate groupings of blocks (a “temple”‐like tower on the left and a multicolored arrangement on the right).  \n•  Total Block Count:  18  \n•  Left‐Hand Structure (5 vertical “layers”):\n   –  Bottom layer:  a wide yellow rectangular plank.  \n   –  Above that:  four orange cylinders forming columns.  \n   –  Next:  a second wide yellow plank resting atop the columns.  \n   –  Next up:  a single red arch block standing in the center.  \n   –  Very top:  a pitched roof made from two orange triangular wedges.  \n\n•  Right‐Hand Structure (essentially 2–3 layers tall, spread out left to right):\n   –  Bottom layer:  two red arch blocks side by side.  \n   –  Seated on / bridging those arches:  two yellow half‐cylinders, plus a blue cube on the left arch and an orange cube/block on the right arch.  \n   –  Behind them stand three vertical prisms: one green rectangular block and two tall yellow rectangular blocks.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2)  SELECTING THE MATCHING DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFrom the block‐dictionary image, the following blocks (by index) are required, in these orientations:\n\n • #1  (Red arch block):  \n   –  Used 3 times total  \n   –  1 × on top of left structure  \n   –  2 × forming the base of the right structure  \n\n • #4  (Blue cube):  \n   –  1 time (in the right‐hand structure)\n\n • #5  (Orange cuboid/cube):  \n   –  1 time (the orange cube on the right‐hand structure)\n\n • #6  (Green rectangular block):  \n   –  1 time\n\n • #7  (Wide yellow rectangular plank):  \n   –  Used 2 times (the lower and upper “planks” in the left structure)\n\n • #8  (Tall yellow rectangular block):  \n   –  Used 2 times (the two tall yellow blocks in the right structure)\n\n • #10 (Orange cylinder):  \n   –  Used 4 times (the four columns in the left structure)\n\n • #12 (Yellow half‐cylinder):  \n   –  Used 2 times (the two half‐cylinders on the right)\n\n • #14 (Orange wedge):  \n   –  1 time (one half of the pitched roof on the left)\n\n • #16 (Orange wedge, opposite slope):  \n   –  1 time (the other half of the pitched roof on the left)\n\nNo other indices appear in the target build.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3)  STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is one possible order (you may of course vary the order, but this is a straightforward front‐to‐back approach):\n\n{\n  Step1:  Move block with index 7       (Left base plank)\n  Step2:  Move block with index 10      (First orange cylinder, left structure)\n  Step3:  Move block with index 10      (Second orange cylinder)\n  Step4:  Move block with index 10      (Third orange cylinder)\n  Step5:  Move block with index 10      (Fourth orange cylinder)\n  Step6:  Move block with index 7       (Top plank over the columns)\n  Step7:  Move block with index 1       (Red arch on top of left structure)\n  Step8:  Move block with index 14      (Left orange wedge for the roof)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 16      (Right orange wedge for the roof)\n\n  Step10: Move block with index 1       (First red arch for right‐hand base)\n  Step11: Move block with index 1       (Second red arch for right‐hand base)\n  Step12: Move block with index 12      (First yellow half‐cylinder)\n  Step13: Move block with index 12      (Second yellow half‐cylinder)\n  Step14: Move block with index 4       (Blue cube on right structure)\n  Step15: Move block with index 5       (Orange cube on right structure)\n  Step16: Move block with index 6       (Green block behind half‐cylinders)\n  Step17: Move block with index 8       (First tall yellow prism)\n  Step18: Move block with index 8       (Second tall yellow prism)\n}\n\nThat completes the assembly exactly as shown in the target image, using only the dictionary blocks in the orientations pictured.",

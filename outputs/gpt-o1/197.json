        "content": "Below is one systematic way to “read off” both little vehicles from the two reference images and then assemble them from the catalog blocks without rotating any pieces.  I have broken the explanation into three parts as requested.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN TARGET IMAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Overall there are two separate “vehicles,” one in yellow with an orange roof (on the left), and one in red with orange roof‐pieces (on the right).\n\nA) Yellow Vehicle\n   – Total Blocks: 4  \n      1. Two yellow half‐cylinders (the “wheels”).  \n      2. One yellow rectangular bar resting on those half‐cylinders.  \n      3. One orange triangular prism perched on top as a “roof.”  \n   – Layers: 3  \n      •  Layer 1 (bottom): both yellow half‐cylinders.  \n      •  Layer 2 (middle): the yellow rectangular bar spanning across the two half‐cylinders.  \n      •  Layer 3 (top): the single orange triangular block.  \n   – Spatial Relationships:  \n      •  Each half‐cylinder is aligned horizontally so its flat face is vertical and curved face is outward.  \n      •  The rectangular bar lies lengthwise above the two half‐cylinders.  \n      •  The triangular roof sits centered on the bar.  \n\nB) Red Vehicle\n   – Total Blocks: 5  \n      1. One red arch at the front (arch opening faces forward).  \n      2. One red arch at the rear (arch opening faces backward).  \n      3. One red rectangular block bridging across the tops of the two arches.  \n      4. Two orange triangular prisms on top forming a peaked “roof.”  \n   – Layers: 3  \n      •  Layer 1 (bottom): the two red arches (front and back).  \n      •  Layer 2 (middle): the single red rectangular block bridging the arches.  \n      •  Layer 3 (top): two orange triangular wedges meeting at the peak.  \n   – Spatial Relationships:  \n      •  The front arch is oriented so its curved opening faces outward (front).  \n      •  The rear arch is oriented so its opening faces outward (rear).  \n      •  A red rectangular block lies flat spanning from the front arch to the back arch.  \n      •  Two triangular wedges share a top edge, forming a roof peak over the middle block.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) SELECTING BLOCKS FROM THE DICTIONARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow are the exact catalog indices (and color/orientation) that match each piece *without* further rotation:\n\nA) Yellow Vehicle\n   1. Half‐Cylinders (2×): Use item #7 (yellow half cylinder lying horizontally).  \n   2. Rectangular Bar (1×): Use item #4 (yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation).  \n   3. Triangular Roof (1×): Use item #13 (orange triangular prism oriented “peak‐up” from the catalog).  \n\nB) Red Vehicle\n   1. Front Arch (1×): Use item #1 (red arch opening oriented forward).  \n   2. Back Arch (1×): Use item #3 (red arch opening oriented backward).  \n   3. Rectangular Bridge (1×): Use item #11 (red rectangular block in the correct horizontal orientation).  \n   4. Triangular Roof Pieces (2×): Use items #14 and #15 (two orange triangular prisms, mirrored to form the “peak”).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) STEP‐BY‐STEP ASSEMBLY ORDER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is a sample order in which one might place the blocks to recreate both vehicles.  (Of course, you can reorder these steps slightly if desired, so long as the final placement is the same.)\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7   (first yellow wheel)\n  Step2: Move block with index 7   (second yellow wheel)\n  Step3: Move block with index 4   (yellow rectangular bar on top of wheels)\n  Step4: Move block with index 13  (orange triangular roof for yellow vehicle)\n\n  Step5: Move block with index 1   (red arch at the front)\n  Step6: Move block with index 3   (red arch at the back)\n  Step7: Move block with index 11  (red rectangular block bridging the two arches)\n  Step8: Move block with index 14  (first orange roof wedge on top)\n  Step9: Move block with index 15  (second orange roof wedge forming the peak)\n}\n\nThat completes the two‐vehicle arrangement exactly as shown in the target image.",

However, because the red “long” block on the right bench must be formed from three separate red cubes (no single long red piece is in the dictionary), the actual total used from the dictionary is 15 individual blocks.\n\n3. **Which Dictionary Blocks Match**\n\n   - **Red Arches (5 needed):** Use block #1 for all arches (it is oriented so the arch faces front).  \n   - **Red Ring (1 needed):** Block #6 (the version with the circular hole facing front).  \n   - **Yellow Planks (2 needed):** Block #12 (oriented horizontally as in the target).  \n   - **Green Cube (1 needed):** Block #8.  \n   - **Blue Cube (1 needed):** Block #7.  \n   - **Red Cubes (4 needed):** Block #10 (used three times to make the “long” red piece plus one more for the small red cube on top).  \n   - **Yellow Cube (1 needed):** Block #11.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\n- Arches: #1 × 5  \n- Ring: #6 × 1  \n- Yellow planks: #12 × 2  \n- Red cubes: #10 × 4  \n- Green cube: #8 × 1  \n- Blue cube: #7 × 1  \n- Yellow cube: #11 × 1  \n\n---\n\n**Assembly Instructions**\n\nBelow is a convenient bottom‐to‐top build order:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1   // Left tower, first red arch  \n  Step2: Move block with index 1   // Left tower, second red arch  \n  Step3: Move block with index 12  // Left tower, yellow plank  \n  Step4: Move block with index 6   // Left tower, red ring  \n  Step5: Move block with index 12  // Left tower, top yellow plank  \n\n  Step6: Move block with index 1   // Right bench, first red arch  \n  Step7: Move block with index 1   // Right bench, second red arch  \n  Step8: Move block with index 1   // Right bench, third red arch  \n\n  // “Long” red bridging section (3 small red cubes side by side)\n  Step9:  Move block with index 10\n  Step10: Move block with index 10\n  Step11: Move block with index 10\n\n  // Four cubes along the top (green, red, blue, yellow)\n  Step12: Move block with index 8   // green cube\n  Step13: Move block with index 10  // red cube\n  Step14: Move block with index 7   // blue cube\n  Step15: Move block with index 11  // yellow cube\n}",

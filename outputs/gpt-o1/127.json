        "content": "Below is a worked‐through example of how one can reproduce the little “bird”‐like figure exactly as shown, using only the orientations given in the second (dictionary) image:\n\n1) ANALYSIS OF THE TARGET IMAGE\n\n• Block count and layers  \n  – There are eight total pieces. From bottom to top:  \n    1) Two yellow cubes at floor level (one at the “front foot,” one at the “rear support”).  \n    2) A single red arch‐shaped block (the semicircular “mouth” facing forward).  \n    3) One green rectangular plank bridging across the top of the red arch.  \n    4) Two blue cubes side by side on top of the green plank (forming the “eyes”).  \n    5) Two orange triangular wedges at the rear, making the “tail.”  \n\n• Overall spatial arrangement  \n  – The bottom layer has two yellow cubes (one under the red arch at the front, the other at the back supporting the tail).  \n  – The red arch block sits squarely above the front yellow cube, with its curved cutout facing front.  \n  – The green rectangular block lies horizontally across the red arch.  \n  – The two blue cubes sit on the green block side by side.  \n  – At the rear, two orange wedges attach so that they slope upward/backward, resting partly on the rear yellow cube and flush against the red arch.\n\n2) SELECTING THE CORRECT DICTIONARY BLOCKS\n\n• From the dictionary image, the needed blocks (with correct color/orientation) are:  \n  – Red arch (index 1) × 1  \n  – Blue cube (index 2) × 2  \n  – Yellow cube (index 4) × 2  \n  – Green short plank, horizontal (index 5) × 1  \n  – Two orange wedges (in the orientations shown as indices 15 and 16) × 1 each  \n\n3) ASSEMBLY ORDER\n\nBelow is one straightforward order in which to place them. Note that you may place them in any order you like so long as they end up in the same arrangement:\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 4\n  Step2: Move block with index 4\n  Step3: Move block with index 1\n  Step4: Move block with index 5\n  Step5: Move block with index 2\n  Step6: Move block with index 2\n  Step7: Move block with index 15\n  Step8: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nFollowing these steps (and keeping each block in its dictionary orientation) will recreate the target structure exactly.",

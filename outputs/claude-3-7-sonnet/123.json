Base layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks positioned side by side (like wheels)\n2. Second layer: A horizontal green rectangular block placed across the two orange cylinders\n3. Third layer: A red cubic block centered on the green rectangular block\n4. Fourth layer: A blue cubic block placed directly on top of the red cube\n5. Top layer: An orange triangular roof piece placed on the blue cube\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Two orange cylindrical blocks - these appear to match block index 7\n2. One green horizontal rectangular block - this matches block index 4\n3. One red cubic block - this matches block index 3\n4. One blue cubic block - this matches block index 1\n5. One orange triangular roof piece - this matches block index 12\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nThe logical assembly sequence would be from bottom to top:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 7\n  Step2: Move block with index 7\n  Step3: Move block with index 4\n  Step4: Move block with index 3\n  Step5: Move block with index 1\n  Step6: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence starts with placing the two cylindrical wheels side by side, then adding the green platform, followed by stacking the red cube, blue cube, and finally placing the orange triangular roof on top.",

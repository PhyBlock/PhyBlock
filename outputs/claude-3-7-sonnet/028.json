Bottom layer: Two orange cylindrical pillars standing on a yellow rectangular base\n2. Middle-lower layer: A yellow rectangular base sitting on top of the orange pillars\n3. Middle-upper layer: Two blue cubic blocks sitting side by side on the yellow base\n4. Top layer: A red house-like structure with an orange roof, which has an arched doorway and sits on top of the blue blocks\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I'll identify the blocks needed:\n\n1. Bottom yellow rectangular base: Block #8 (horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n2. Two orange cylindrical pillars: Block #10 (vertical orange cylinder) - needed twice\n3. Middle yellow rectangular base: Block #8 (horizontal yellow rectangular block) - reused\n4. Two blue cubic blocks: Block #5 (blue cube) - needed twice\n5. Red house structure with arch: Block #2 (red block with arch)\n6. Orange roof: Block #14, #15, and #16 form different parts of a triangular roof structure. Based on the perspective, Block #16 appears to be the best match for the orange roof piece.\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nThe assembly follows a bottom-to-top approach, starting with the base and working upward to create a stable structure.",

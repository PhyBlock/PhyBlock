Bottom Layer: Two red arch blocks positioned side by side with a yellow rectangular block on top of them\n2. Middle Layer: A red block with a circular hole through it\n3. Top Layer: A yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top\n\nIn total, I count 5 blocks:\n- 3 red blocks (2 arch blocks at the bottom and 1 block with a circular hole in the middle)\n- 2 yellow rectangular blocks (1 in the middle layer and 1 at the top)\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nLooking at the blocks dictionary, I need:\n- For the bottom layer: Two red arch blocks (blocks #1 and #2)\n- For the middle support: One yellow horizontal rectangular block (block #9 or #10 - they appear identical)\n- For the middle layer: One red block with a circular hole (block #5)\n- For the top layer: One yellow horizontal rectangular block (block #9 or #10)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on the structure, here's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 2\n  Step3: Move block with index 9\n  Step4: Move block with index 5\n  Step5: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence starts from the bottom of the structure and builds upward, first placing the two arch blocks side by side, then the yellow rectangular support, followed by the red block with the circular hole, and finally the yellow rectangular block on top.",

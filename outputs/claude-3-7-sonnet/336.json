Red arch block (index 1) - for the top of the tower with an arch\n2. Red block with double arch (index 2) - for the base of the tower\n3. Blue cube (index 5) - for the third layer of the tower\n4. Green rectangular block (index 7) - for the second layer of the tower\n5. Yellow rectangular block (index 10) - for the beam of the bridge\n6. Orange cylindrical blocks (index 11) - two of these for the bridge supports\n7. Orange triangular roof (index 15) - for the top of the tower\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 15\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 11\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts from the bottom of the tower structure and builds upward, then creates the bridge structure from the supports up to the beam.",

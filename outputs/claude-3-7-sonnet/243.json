The structure can be divided into two main parts:\n\n1. **Left Structure (Tower/House):**\n   - A vertical tower with an orange/red house-like structure on top\n   - Consists of multiple layers\n\n2. **Right Structure (Train/Vehicle):**\n   - A horizontal arrangement that resembles a train or vehicle\n   - Has multiple colored blocks arranged in rows\n\n## Block Count and Layers\n\nThe entire structure uses approximately 19 building blocks and consists of:\n- The left tower has 5 layers (including orange cylinders, yellow platforms, red house, and orange roof)\n- The right structure has 3 layers (base with arches, middle section with cylinders, top section with cubes)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Left Structure:\n- Base: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (platform)\n- Second layer: Two orange cylindrical pillars standing vertically on the base\n- Third layer: Another yellow horizontal rectangular block (platform) resting on the orange pillars\n- Fourth layer: Red house-shaped block with an arched doorway\n- Top layer: Orange/coral triangular roof pieces\n\n### Right Structure:\n- Base: Red blocks with arched openings arranged horizontally\n- Behind base: Green vertical rectangular block on the right side\n- Middle layer: Yellow cylindrical blocks laid horizontally\n- Top layer: Various cubic blocks - blue cube, yellow rectangular blocks, green rectangular block, and orange/red cube\n\n# Selection of Required Blocks\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch block (index 1) - 3 instances\n2. Blue cube (index 3) - 1 instance\n3. Orange/red cube (index 4) - 1 instance\n4. Red cube (index 5) - 1 instance\n5. Green vertical rectangular block (index 6) - 1 instance\n6. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 7) - 1 instance\n7. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 8) - 2 instances\n8. Yellow vertical rectangular block (index 9) - 2 instances\n9. Orange cylindrical pillar (index 10) - 2 instances\n10. Yellow cylindrical block (index 11) - 1 instance\n11. Yellow cylindrical block, different angle (index 12) - 1 instance\n12. Orange triangular roof piece (index 13) - 1 instance\n13. Orange cube (index 14) - 1 instance\n14. Orange triangular piece (index 15) - 1 instance\n15. Orange triangular piece, different angle (index 16) - 1 instance\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 7\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n    Step12: Move block with index 11\n    Step13: Move block with index 12\n    Step14: Move block with index 3\n    Step15: Move block with index 9\n    Step16: Move block with index 9\n    Step17: Move block with index 5\n    Step18: Move block with index 4\n    Step19: Move block with index 14\n}\n```",

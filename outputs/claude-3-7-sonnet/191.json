The blue cube is positioned on top of the yellow block.\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks from the dictionary are needed:\n\n1. Block #1: Red arch block (for the base of the left structure)\n2. Block #6: Green rectangular block (for the second layer of the left structure)\n3. Block #3: Blue cube (for the top of the left structure and top of the right structure)\n4. Block #13 or #15: Orange triangular roof (for the top of the left structure)\n5. Block #13 or #15: Orange triangular roof (for the top of the orange cylinder)\n6. Block #9: Orange vertical cylinder (for the standalone cylinder next to the left structure)\n7. Block #10: Orange horizontal cylinder (for the wheels of the right structure, used twice)\n8. Block #7 or #8: Yellow rectangular block (for the platform of the right structure)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 15\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 15\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n\nNote: For the triangular roof pieces, I've selected index 15 as it appears to be the correct orientation for both roof pieces. For the yellow rectangular block, I've chosen index 7 as it appears to match the horizontal orientation needed for the vehicle platform.",

Bottom layer: A red rectangular block with a semi-circular cutout/tunnel (similar to an arch)\n2. Second layer: A green rectangular flat block\n3. Middle layer: A yellow block with two half-cylinder shapes on top\n4. Fourth layer: Another green rectangular flat block (identical to the second layer)\n5. Top layer: A red rectangular block with a semi-circular cutout/tunnel (identical to the bottom layer but flipped 180 degrees)\n\nThe structure has symmetry, with the red blocks with cutouts at the top and bottom, green flat blocks as spacers, and a yellow decorative block in the center.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. For the bottom layer: Block index 6 - A red rectangular block with a semi-circular cutout\n2. For the second layer: Block index 11 - A green rectangular flat block\n3. For the middle layer: Block that appears to be made of two yellow half-cylinders side by side - Block index 12 and Block index 13 (two of these will be needed side by side)\n4. For the fourth layer: Block index 11 - A green rectangular flat block (same as second layer)\n5. For the top layer: Block index 7 - A red rectangular block with a semi-circular cutout (in the opposite orientation of the bottom block)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nStarting from the bottom and building up:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order creates the symmetrical tower structure shown in the main target image, with the red arched blocks at the top and bottom, green rectangular blocks as spacers, and the yellow decorative elements in the middle.",

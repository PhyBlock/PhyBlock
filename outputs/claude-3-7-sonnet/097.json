Block #1: Red U-shaped block\n2. Block #8: Yellow curved roof piece (need two of these)\n3. Block #3: Blue cube\n4. Block #4: Yellow cube\n5. Block #6: Green horizontal rectangular block\n6. Block #7: Orange cylinder\n7. Block #15: Orange triangular block\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 15\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 3\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 8\n   Step8: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence begins with the base layer (green block, orange cylinder, orange triangle), then builds the middle layer (yellow and blue cubes), followed by the top red block with U-shaped cutout, and finally adds the two yellow roof pieces on top.",

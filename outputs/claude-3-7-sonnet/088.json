These blocks are positioned through the tunnel/opening of the red blocks.\n- Layer 3 (top): Another red block with a semi-circular cutout (tunnel) facing forward, positioned above the blue blocks and aligned with the bottom red block.\n\nThe overall structure resembles a red rectangular frame with a circular hole through it, with two blue cubes inserted horizontally through the middle of this hole.\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the main target image, I need:\n1. Two identical red blocks with tunnel/arch cutouts (for top and bottom) - Block #1\n2. Two identical blue cubic blocks - Block #9\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n\nThe assembly begins with the bottom red tunnel block as the foundation, followed by placing the two blue cubes through its opening, and finally placing the second red tunnel block on top to complete the structure.",

The construction has the following characteristics:\n\n### Count & Layers:\n- The main tower has 4 layers\n- A separate small structure with 1 layer is positioned to the right\n- Total of 13 blocks used across both structures\n\n### Main Tower Structure (from bottom to top):\n- Layer 1 (Bottom): 1 yellow horizontal rectangular block with 2 green rectangular blocks on top\n- Layer 2: 1 yellow horizontal rectangular block with 2 orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically\n- Layer 3: 1 yellow horizontal rectangular block\n- Layer 4 (Top): 1 orange triangular prism\n\n### Separate Structure:\n- 2 horizontal orange cylindrical blocks with 1 yellow horizontal rectangular block resting on top\n\n## Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, these are the blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\n1. Green vertical rectangular blocks (indexes 1 and 2) - used in the bottom layer of the tower\n2. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (indexes 4, 7 and 8) - used as supporting layers in the tower and on top of the separate structure\n3. Orange vertical cylindrical blocks (index 9) - used in the second layer of the tower and in the separate structure\n4. Orange horizontal cylindrical block (index 10) - used in the separate structure\n5. Orange triangular prism (index 13) - used at the top of the tower\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the tower from bottom to top first, then creates the separate structure to the right.",

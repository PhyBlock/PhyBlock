On top of the upper yellow platform sits an orange triangular prism.\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (for bottom base) - Block Index 6\n2. Green vertical rectangular blocks (three of them) - Block Index 3\n3. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (for top) - Block Index 6\n4. Orange triangular prism - Block Index 12\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on the structure, here is the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from bottom to top, starting with the base, then adding the three vertical green columns, followed by the top yellow platform, and finally placing the orange triangular prism on top.",

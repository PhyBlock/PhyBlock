Four orange cylindrical pillars form the base/legs in a rectangular arrangement\n2. A horizontal yellow rectangular block sits on top of these pillars\n3. A vertical orange cylinder stands in the center of the yellow block\n4. A yellow half-cylinder dome caps the orange cylinder\n5. Extending from one side is a complex assembly of blocks:\n   - Orange blocks form the outer parts\n   - Blue blocks form an inner framework\n   - A green square block sits in the middle of this extension\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n- 4× orange cylinders (block #8) for the legs\n- 1× yellow rectangular block (block #6) for the table top\n- 1× orange cylinder (block #8) for the vertical post\n- 1× yellow half-cylinder dome (block #10 or #11) for the top cap\n- 2× orange cubes (block #2) for parts of the extension\n- 2× orange triangular prisms (block #16) for parts of the extension\n- 1× orange rectangular prism (block #13) for part of the extension\n- 1× orange thin block (block #12) for part of the extension\n- 2× blue small cubes (block #5) for parts of the extension\n- 1× larger blue cube (block #4) for part of the extension\n- 1× green cube (block #1) for center of the extension\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 13\n   Step9: Move block with index 16\n   Step10: Move block with index 2\n   Step11: Move block with index 2\n   Step12: Move block with index 12\n   Step13: Move block with index 16\n   Step14: Move block with index 5\n   Step15: Move block with index 1\n   Step16: Move block with index 5\n   Step17: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts from the base (legs), builds up to the table structure, and finally constructs the side extension.",

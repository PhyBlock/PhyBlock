The structure consists of several building blocks arranged in multiple layers.\n\n**Count & Layers:**\n- Total number of blocks: 9\n- Number of layers: 4\n\n**Spatial Relationships:**\n1. Bottom layer (1st layer): 3 blue cubic blocks arranged in an L-shape pattern\n2. Second layer: 1 long yellow rectangular block spanning across the blue blocks\n3. Third layer: 1 blue cubic block on the left, 1 red cubic block on the right, with 1 green rectangular block on top of them\n4. Top layer (4th layer): 2 orange triangular roof pieces forming a house-like peak\n\n## Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Blue cubic blocks (3 instances) - Block index 1\n2. Red cubic block (1 instance) - Block index 2\n3. Green horizontal rectangular block (1 instance) - Block index 4\n4. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (1 instance) - Block index 8\n5. Orange triangular roof pieces (2 instances) - Blocks with indices 16 and 15\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 4\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n}\n```",

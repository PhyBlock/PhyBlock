For the red U-shaped base: Block with index **2** (this shows the red U-shaped block in the correct orientation)\n2. For the blue cube: Block with index **4** (blue cube)\n3. For the green rectangular block: Block with index **8** (green horizontal rectangle)\n4. For the orange triangular roof: Block with index **16** (orange triangular prism)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on the structure shown, the logical assembly order would be from bottom to top:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 4\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the U-shaped base, then places the blue cube on it, followed by the green rectangular platform, and finally tops it with the orange triangular roof piece.",

Block index 1: Red block with arch/tunnel (for base)\n2. Block index 5: Green rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n3. Block index 8: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n4. Block index 13: Orange triangular block (left side of roof)\n5. Block index 14: Orange triangular block (middle of roof)\n6. Block index 16: Orange triangular block (right side of roof)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 5\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 13\n   Step5: Move block with index 14\n   Step6: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly starts with the base, builds upward with the green and yellow blocks, and finishes with the triangular orange roof pieces from left to right.",

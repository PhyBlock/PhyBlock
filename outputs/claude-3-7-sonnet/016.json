The yellow rectangular block sits horizontally across the top of both blue cubes. The red house structure with an archway sits on top of the yellow block, and the orange triangular roof pieces form the top of the house.\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis of the blocks needed and comparing with the block dictionary, I need:\n\n1. Two blue cube blocks (blocks #5, #6, or #7) - they appear identical, so I'll use #5 twice\n2. One yellow horizontal rectangular block (block #8)\n3. One red archway/house structure (block #1)\n4. Two orange triangular roof pieces (blocks #13 and #15 appear to match the orientation needed)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nThe logical assembly order would be from bottom to top:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence will create the house structure as shown in the target image, building from the foundation up to the roof.",

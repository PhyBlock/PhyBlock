Block 3 - Red block with two semi-circular cutouts\n2. Block 6 - Blue cube\n3. Block 9 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (bottom of right structure)\n4. Block 12 - Orange vertical cylinder (used twice for the pillars)\n5. Block 10 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (middle of right structure)\n6. Block 1 - Red arch/house block\n7. Block 14 - Orange triangular roof piece\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 12\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 10\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 14\n   Step7: Move block with index 3\n   Step8: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first builds the right structure from the ground up (steps 1-6), and then creates the left structure (steps 7-8).",

Green horizontal rectangular blocks (for top and bottom) - Block indices 6 and 7 appear suitable\n2. Yellow vertical rectangular blocks (for the sides of the middle layer) - Block indices 13 and 14\n3. Orange cube (for top part of middle section) - Block index 3\n4. Blue cube (for middle part of middle section) - Block index 1\n5. Red cube (for bottom part of middle section) - Block index 4\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the bottom green block as the foundation, then adds the vertical yellow blocks for the sides, followed by the three colored cubes in the middle (from top to bottom), and finally caps the structure with the top green block.",

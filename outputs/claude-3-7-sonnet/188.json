Left Structure:\n   - 3 orange cylindrical blocks (block #6) arranged in an \"L\" shape: two vertical cylinders connected by one horizontal cylinder on top\n   - 1 yellow half-cylindrical block (block #7) placed on top of the vertical orange cylinder\n   - 1 yellow rectangular block (block #3) placed horizontally across the two vertical orange cylinders\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - 1 orange cylindrical block (block #6) standing vertically\n   - 3 orange triangular/wedge blocks (blocks #12, #14, and #15) arranged around the cylinder\n   - 2 blue rectangular blocks (blocks #1 and #2) placed vertically on either side of the cylinder\n\nTotal block count: 11 blocks arranged in a multi-layered composition with various spatial relationships.\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n- Block #1: Blue cube/rectangular block (used 1 time)\n- Block #2: Blue rectangular block (used 1 time)\n- Block #3: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (used 1 time)\n- Block #6: Orange cylinder (used 4 times)\n- Block #7: Yellow half-cylindrical block (used 1 time)\n- Block #12: Orange triangular/wedge block (used 1 time)\n- Block #14: Orange triangular/wedge block (used 1 time)\n- Block #15: Orange triangular/wedge block (used 1 time)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 6 \n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 2\n   Step9: Move block with index 12\n   Step10: Move block with index 14\n   Step11: Move block with index 15\n}",

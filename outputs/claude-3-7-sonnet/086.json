Let me describe it in detail:\n\n- **Count & Layers**: The structure has approximately 9-10 blocks arranged in 4 main layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships**:\n  - Bottom layer: Three blue cubic blocks arranged as supports (two in front, one in back)\n  - Second layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block sitting across the blue supports\n  - Third layer: A red cube and a blue cube side by side, with a green horizontal rectangular block on top\n  - Top layer: Orange triangular roof pieces forming a peaked roof\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the main target image, I need to identify the exact blocks needed from the dictionary:\n\n1. For the bottom layer: Blue cubes - blocks with indices 1 (for the two front supports) and 6 (for the rear support)\n2. For the second layer: Yellow horizontal rectangular block - block with index 10\n3. For the third layer: Red cube - block with index 3, blue cube - block with index 1, and green horizontal rectangular block - block with index 7\n4. For the top layer: Orange triangular roof pieces - blocks with indices 13, 14, and 15 forming the peaked roof\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on the physical structure, I'll infer a logical bottom-up assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 1\n  Step3: Move block with index 6\n  Step4: Move block with index 10\n  Step5: Move block with index 3\n  Step6: Move block with index 1\n  Step7: Move block with index 7\n  Step8: Move block with index 13\n  Step9: Move block with index 15\n  Step10: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the support blocks at the bottom, adds the horizontal platform, builds the middle section with the cubes, adds the green rectangular block, and finally assembles the triangular roof pieces to complete the structure.",

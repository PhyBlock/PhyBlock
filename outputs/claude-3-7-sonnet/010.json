Blue cubes (3 of them) - indices 1, 2, and 3 from the dictionary\n2. Orange vertical cylinder (1) - index 4\n3. Orange triangular wedges (4) - indices 11, 13, 15, and 16 (they appear to be the same shape in different orientations)\n4. Orange triangular roof piece (1) - index 12\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 \n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly starts with creating the blue cross base structure (steps 1-3), then adding the triangular wedges around it (steps 4-7), followed by placing the vertical cylinder on top (step 8), and finally adding the triangular roof piece (step 9).",

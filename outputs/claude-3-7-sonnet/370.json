Left Section:\n   - Bottom: A red block with two archways\n   - Middle: A green rectangular block placed horizontally\n   - Top: A red block with a single archway\n\n2. Right Section:\n   - Bottom: A red curved track-like piece with raised edges\n   - Middle layer 1: A blue cube \n   - Middle layer 2: A green rectangular block placed horizontally\n   - Top: A red block with a single archway, with an orange triangular/roof piece on top\n\nThe two sections are connected by the curved red piece at the bottom.\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Red arch block (index 1) - 2 pieces\n2. Red curved track piece (index 2) - 2 pieces\n3. Red archway block (index 3) - 1 piece\n4. Red vertical piece (index 4) - 1 piece\n5. Blue cube (index 5) - 1 piece\n6. Green cube (index 6) - 0 pieces (not used)\n7. Orange cube (index 7) - 0 pieces (not used)\n8. Yellow cube (index 8) - 0 pieces (not used)\n9. Green flat rectangular block (index 9) - 0 pieces (not used)\n10. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 10) - 2 pieces\n11. Green vertical rectangular block (index 11) - 0 pieces (not used)\n12. Green vertical rectangular block (index 12) - 0 pieces (not used)\n13. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 13) - 0 pieces (not used)\n14. Orange cube (index 14) - 0 pieces (not used)\n15. Orange triangular/roof piece (index 15) - 1 piece\n16. Orange triangular/roof piece (index 16) - 0 pieces (not used)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 1\n   Step9: Move block with index 4\n   Step10: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts from the bottom curved pieces, builds up the right section with the blue cube and green block, then completes the left section, and finally adds the top red piece and orange triangular roof.",

Let me analyze the details:\n\n- **Count & Layers**: The structure consists of 7 blocks total, arranged in 2 layers\n- **Spatial Relationships**:\n  - Bottom layer: Two red arch blocks side by side (forming a bridge-like base), with a yellow cube on the right end\n  - Top layer: Four cubes in a row - green, red, blue, and yellow (from left to right)\n  - The top layer cubes sit on top of the bottom layer elements\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the dictionary image, I need to identify the exact blocks needed:\n\n1. **Bottom Layer**:\n   - Two red arch blocks (appear to be blocks 1 and 2 from the dictionary)\n   - One yellow cube (block 13)\n   \n2. **Top Layer**:\n   - One green cube (block 10)\n   - One red cube (block 12)\n   - One blue cube (block 9)\n   - One yellow cube (block 13 again)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nI'll arrange the assembly from bottom to top:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 13\n   Step4: Move block with index 10\n   Step5: Move block with index 12\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n   Step7: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly begins with the base arch blocks (1, 2), followed by the yellow cube (13) at the right end of the bottom layer. Then we place the four colored cubes on top in sequence from left to right: green (10), red (12), blue (9), and yellow (13).",

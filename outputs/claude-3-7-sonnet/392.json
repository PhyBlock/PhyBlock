A foundation of yellow rectangular blocks\n2. Four orange cylindrical pillars supporting an upper platform\n3. Yellow rectangular blocks forming a platform above the pillars\n4. A red house-like structure with an arched opening on top of the platform\n5. A side structure with colorful blocks (green, blue, yellow) on the left side\n6. Red curved blocks forming a ramp-like feature on the left side\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Yellow rectangular blocks (indices 9 and 11) - for foundation and upper platform\n2. Orange cylindrical pillars (index 12) - for the vertical supports\n3. Red house components (index 1) - for the house structure with arch\n4. Red curved blocks (indices 2 and 3) - for the ramp feature\n5. Colorful blocks (indices 5, 7, 8) - for the side structure\n6. Orange triangular roof pieces (indices 13, 14, 15, 16) - for the roof of the house\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 11\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n    Step12: Move block with index 5\n    Step13: Move block with index 7\n    Step14: Move block with index 8\n    Step15: Move block with index 2\n    Step16: Move block with index 1\n    Step17: Move block with index 13\n    Step18: Move block with index 14\n    Step19: Move block with index 15\n    Step20: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the foundation, adds the support pillars, places the upper platform, builds the side structure with colored blocks, adds the ramp feature, and finally constructs the house structure with its roof components.",

Left Structure (House-like):\n   - 6 blocks total\n   - 3 layers (base blue cubes, yellow platform, red house with orange roof)\n\n2. Right Structure (Vehicle-like):\n   - 5 blocks total\n   - 2 layers (orange cylinder base, yellow top parts)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Left Structure (House-like):\n- Base layer: Two blue cube blocks (index 3) positioned side by side\n- Middle layer: One horizontal yellow rectangular block (index 4) placed across the two blue cubes\n- Top layer: Red house-shaped structure with an archway (index 1) and an orange triangular roof (appears to be indices 15 and 16)\n\n### Right Structure (Vehicle-like):\n- Base layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks (index 8) with a third orange cylinder (index 9) connecting them horizontally\n- Top layer: One blue cube (index 3) at the back with a yellow rectangular block (index 4) extending forward with a yellow half-cylinder (index 10) at the front\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nFor the Left Structure (House-like):\n- 2× Blue cubes (index 3)\n- 1× Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 4)\n- 1× Red house-shaped block with archway (index 1)\n- 1× Orange triangular roof piece (composed of indices 15 and 16)\n\nFor the Right Structure (Vehicle-like):\n- 3× Orange cylindrical blocks (2× index 8 for vertical supports, 1× index 9 for horizontal connector)\n- 1× Blue cube (index 3)\n- 1× Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 4)\n- 1× Yellow half-cylinder (index 10)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 15\n   Step6: Move block with index 16\n   Step7: Move block with index 8\n   Step8: Move block with index 8\n   Step9: Move block with index 9\n   Step10: Move block with index 3\n   Step11: Move block with index 4\n   Step12: Move block with index 10\n}\n```",

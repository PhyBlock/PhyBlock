Each structure consists of the following:\n\n### Structure Breakdown:\n- Total blocks per structure: 9 blocks\n- Number of layers: 4 layers\n\n### Spatial Arrangement (from bottom to top):\n1. Bottom layer: Two blue cube blocks positioned to form the \"legs\" of the structure\n2. Middle-bottom layer: One horizontal yellow rectangular block positioned across the blue cubes\n3. Middle-top layer: Three blocks - one blue cube on the left, one red cube on the right, and one green horizontal rectangular block on top\n4. Top layer: One orange triangular roof piece\n\n## Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the structure in the target image, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Blue cube blocks (index 1) - 3 per structure\n2. Red cube block (index 3) - 1 per structure\n3. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 8) - 1 per structure\n4. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 9) - 1 per structure\n5. Orange triangular roof piece (index 14) - 1 per structure\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nThe logical assembly sequence would be to build from the bottom up:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence constructs one of the identical structures. The same sequence would be repeated to build the second structure.",

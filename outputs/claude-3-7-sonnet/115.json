Blue rectangular block (appears to be vertically oriented) - matches with block index 1\n2. Two orange triangular/wedge blocks (positioned at the bottom layer) - match with blocks 13 and 15\n3. Green rectangular block (horizontally positioned in the middle layer) - matches with block 6\n4. Orange triangular/wedge block (positioned at the top) - matches with block 11\n\n## Required Block Indices:\n- Block 1 (Blue cube/rectangular block)\n- Block 6 (Green horizontal rectangular block)\n- Block 11 (Orange triangular/wedge-shaped block)\n- Block 13 (Orange triangular/wedge-shaped block)\n- Block 15 (Orange triangular/wedge-shaped block)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 13\n  Step2: Move block with index 1\n  Step3: Move block with index 15\n  Step4: Move block with index 6\n  Step5: Move block with index 11\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence starts from the bottom layer, placing the left orange wedge first, then the central blue block, followed by the right orange wedge. Then we place the green horizontal block on top of these three, and finally position the orange triangular block on top of the green block.",

The structures each have 2 layers (a base layer and blocks on top).\n\n# Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need to select the following blocks:\n\n1. For the red double concave block: Block index 2\n2. For the blue cubes: Block index 6 (needed twice)\n3. For the green cube: Block index 7\n4. For the yellow double convex block: This appears to be a combination of blocks 11 and 12 side by side\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first creates the left structure (steps 1-2) and then the right structure (steps 3-6). For each structure, we place the base block first and then add the blocks on top.",

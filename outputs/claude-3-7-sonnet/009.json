It has 1 main layer with some blocks appearing to be placed on one side of the structure.\n\nComponents:\n- 3 green rectangular blocks (2 tall vertical rectangles on the sides and 1 horizontal rectangle at the back)\n- 2 orange cylindrical blocks in the center\n- 4 orange triangular/wedge-shaped blocks (forming roof-like elements on the sides and top)\n\nSpatial relationships:\n- The center of the structure has two vertical orange cylindrical blocks placed side by side\n- A green vertical rectangular block is positioned on each side of the cylindrical blocks\n- Three orange triangular/wedge blocks are placed on the sides (one on the left and two on the right) \n- One orange triangular block is placed on top of the cylinders forming a roof-like structure\n- A green horizontal rectangular block appears to be at the back of the structure\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis of the target structure, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Green rectangular blocks:\n   - Block with index 2 (vertical green rectangle) - needed twice\n   - Block with index 4 (horizontal green rectangle) - needed once\n\n2. Orange cylindrical blocks:\n   - Block with index 5 (vertical orange cylinder) - needed twice\n\n3. Orange triangular/wedge blocks:\n   - Block with index 11 (orange triangular wedge) - needed once\n   - Block with index 13 (orange triangular wedge) - needed once\n   - Block with index 15 (orange triangular wedge) - needed once\n   - Block with index 16 (orange triangular wedge) - needed once\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 5\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 13\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n   Step9: Move block with index 16\n}\n```",

A small house-like structure on the left:\n   - 3 blocks total\n   - 3 layers (red arch block at bottom, blue cube in middle, orange roof on top)\n\n2. A larger bridge-like structure on the right:\n   - 8 blocks total\n   - 3 layers (4 red arch blocks as foundation, 3 yellow blocks in middle forming a bridge, 1 red cube on top)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Small House Structure:\n- Bottom layer: Red arch block (facing forward)\n- Middle layer: Blue cube placed on top of the red arch block\n- Top layer: Orange triangular roof piece\n\n### Bridge Structure:\n- Bottom layer: 4 red arch blocks arranged in a square formation with arches facing outward in four directions\n- Middle layer: 3 yellow blocks - a long yellow rectangular block across the top connecting two red arches, and two smaller yellow pieces (appears to be a half-cylinder and a small rectangular piece)\n- Top layer: A red cube sitting on top of one of the arch blocks\n\n# Selection of Required Blocks\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\nFor the Small House:\n- Block #2: Red arch block (for the base)\n- Block #6: Blue cube (for the middle)\n- Block #15: Orange triangular roof (for the top)\n\nFor the Bridge Structure:\n- Block #1: Red arch block (2 of these)\n- Block #2: Red arch block (2 of these, arranged in different directions)\n- Block #9: Yellow rectangular block (for the bridge connection)\n- Block #10: Yellow half-cylinder (inside one of the arches)\n- Block #12: Yellow flat rectangular block (appears to be peeking out under one side)\n- Block #7: Red cube (for the top of one arch)\n\n# Assembly Order Instructions\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 6\n    Step11: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first builds the bridge structure's foundation with the red arch blocks, adds the yellow connecting blocks, places the red cube on top, and then constructs the small house structure separately.",

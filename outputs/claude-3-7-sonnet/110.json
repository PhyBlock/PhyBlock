Here's my detailed analysis:\n\n### Count & Layers:\n- The structure has 8 distinct blocks\n- The structure has 4 main layers from bottom to top\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- Bottom layer: Two yellow curved/arch blocks side by side at the front, with a green cube and blue cube in the back\n- Second layer: A horizontal yellow rectangular block that spans across the top of both the green and blue cubes\n- Third layer: A red block with a circular opening/tunnel in it\n- Fourth layer: A horizontal green rectangular block on top of the red block\n- Top layer: An orange triangular/roof-shaped block on top of the green rectangular block\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Bottom layer:\n   - Block #11 (yellow arch) - used twice side by side\n   - Block #4 (green cube)\n   - Block #3 (blue cube)\n\n2. Second layer:\n   - Block #10 (horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n\n3. Third layer:\n   - Block #2 (red block with circular opening)\n\n4. Fourth layer:\n   - Block #7 (horizontal green rectangular block)\n\n5. Top layer:\n   - Block #16 (orange triangular/roof-shaped block)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nFollowing a bottom-up construction approach:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 2\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the back blocks of the bottom layer, then adds the front arches, builds up through the yellow horizontal block, the red block with opening, the green block on top, and finally places the orange triangular roof piece.",

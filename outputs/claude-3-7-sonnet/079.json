Red block with circular hole (index 2) - This is the center block of the base layer\n2. Yellow square blocks (index 9) - Need 2 of these for the left and right sides of the base layer\n3. Green square block (index 7) - For the left side of the middle layer\n4. Blue square block (index 6) - For the right side of the middle layer\n5. Orange triangular blocks (indices 13, 14, 15, 16) - Need 6 of these for the triangular portions (2 in base layer, 1 in middle layer, and 3 for the roof)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n    Step11: Move block with index 15\n    Step12: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly starts with the central red block with the hole, then adds the yellow squares on either side, followed by the orange triangular blocks at the base. Then we build upward with the green and blue blocks in the middle layer, add the final orange triangular block on the right side of the middle layer, and finish with the four triangular orange blocks forming the roof structure.",

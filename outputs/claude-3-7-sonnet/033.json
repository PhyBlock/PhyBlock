Bottom layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block\n2. Middle layer: Two orange cylindrical columns placed vertically side by side\n3. Top layer: A yellow horizontal rectangular block with an orange triangular prism (appears to be a roof/pyramid shape) on top\n\nIn total, there are 5 blocks used in the construction:\n- 2 yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (on bottom and top)\n- 2 orange vertical cylindrical columns\n- 1 orange triangular prism/pyramid block\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis of the required blocks and matching them with the dictionary:\n\n1. For the yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (top and bottom): Block with index 2\n   - These appear to be identical horizontal yellow rectangular blocks\n\n2. For the orange vertical cylindrical columns: Block with index 7\n   - These are vertically oriented orange cylindrical columns\n\n3. For the orange triangular prism/pyramid: Block with index 13\n   - This is an orange triangular prism in the correct orientation\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nFollowing a bottom-up construction approach:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 7\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence will create the structure shown in the target image, starting with the bottom yellow block, then adding the two orange cylindrical columns, followed by the top yellow block, and finally placing the orange triangular prism on top.",

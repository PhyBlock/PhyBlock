Left structure: A house-like construction with a red archway and orange triangular roof\n2. Right structure: A platform or bridge-like construction with vertical green pillars and yellow horizontal pieces\n\nTotal block count: Approximately 18-20 blocks\nLayers: The structure has 3 primary vertical layers (base, middle, top)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n### Left Structure:\n- Base layer: Green rectangular blocks on either side of orange cylindrical pieces\n- Middle layer: Red archway block with orange cylindrical column inside it\n- Top layer: Orange triangular roof piece on top of the red block\n\n### Right Structure:\n- Base layer: Red archway block serving as a base\n- Middle layer: Two vertical green rectangular blocks with yellow rectangular blocks at top and bottom\n- Top layer: Yellow horizontal rectangle with orange triangular roof piece\n\n### Connecting Elements:\n- Orange ramp/inclined blocks connecting the two structures\n- Several green blocks serving as supports\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n1. Red archway blocks (indices 1 and 2) - For the base of the right structure and part of the left structure\n2. Red curved block (index 3) - For the left structure\n3. Red vertical block with cutout (index 4) - For part of the left structure\n4. Green vertical rectangular blocks (index 5) - For the vertical supports in both structures\n5. Green horizontal rectangular blocks (index 6) - For horizontal supports\n6. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (indices 7 and 8) - For the platform pieces\n7. Yellow vertical rectangular block (index 9) - For structural support\n8. Orange vertical cylindrical blocks (indices 10 and 11) - For the columns in the left structure\n9. Orange triangular roof pieces (indices 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) - For the roof elements on both structures\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 5\nStep3: Move block with index 5\nStep4: Move block with index 6\nStep5: Move block with index 6\nStep6: Move block with index 10\nStep7: Move block with index 11\nStep8: Move block with index 4\nStep9: Move block with index 3\nStep10: Move block with index 13\nStep11: Move block with index 2\nStep12: Move block with index 5\nStep13: Move block with index 5\nStep14: Move block with index 7\nStep15: Move block with index 8\nStep16: Move block with index 9\nStep17: Move block with index 14\nStep18: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order places the base elements first, builds up the vertical supports, adds the horizontal connecting elements, and finally adds the roof pieces to complete the structure.",

The structure has 3 layers:\n\n1. Bottom layer: Two red arch blocks on either side, forming the base/wheels\n2. Middle layer: A yellow rectangular block spanning across the arches, with blue blocks on top\n3. Top layer: A green rectangular block with an orange triangular block on top\n\nIn total, there are 8 blocks in the structure:\n- 2 red arch blocks (for the base)\n- 1 yellow horizontal rectangular block\n- 2 blue cube blocks\n- 1 blue triangular/wedge block\n- 1 green rectangular block\n- 1 orange triangular block\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Block #1 - Red arch block (left side)\n2. Block #2 - Red arch block (right side)\n3. Block #8 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n4. Block #4 - Blue cube block (2 instances)\n5. Block #7 - Green horizontal rectangular block\n6. Block #14 - Orange triangular block\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the base (red arches), builds the middle platform (yellow block), adds the blue blocks on top, then places the green block as a platform for the orange triangular block on the very top.",

Red blocks with semi-circular cutouts (4 blocks total):\n   - Two blocks matching index 1 (red block with arch cutout facing left)\n   - Two blocks matching index 2 (red block with arch cutout facing right)\n\n2. Yellow horizontal connector (1 block):\n   - One block matching index 9 (yellow horizontal rectangular block)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nFor proper assembly, I'll start with the base layer of red blocks and then place the yellow connector on top:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nThe first four steps establish the red blocks with arches, positioned to form the base structure, and the final step adds the yellow connector across the top to complete the arrangement shown in the target image.",

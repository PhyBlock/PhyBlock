Let me break down the details:\n\n## Count & Layers\nThe structure has 8 distinct blocks arranged in 4 layers:\n- Layer 1 (bottom): Green rectangular block\n- Layer 2: Orange cylindrical block\n- Layer 3: Frame made of yellow and green blocks with an orange triangular block inside\n- Layer 4 (top): Yellow rectangular block\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- At the base is a green rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n- On top of the green base is an orange cylindrical block, positioned centrally\n- Above the cylinder is a frame consisting of:\n  - Two vertical green rectangular blocks forming the sides\n  - Two horizontal yellow rectangular blocks at the top and bottom\n  - Inside the frame is an orange triangular block positioned at the bottom center\n- The top layer is a horizontal yellow rectangular block that spans across the two vertical green blocks\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Block 7: Green horizontal rectangular block (for the base)\n2. Block 13: Orange cylindrical block (for the second layer)\n3. Block 8: Green vertical rectangular block (for the left side of the frame)\n4. Block 9: Green vertical rectangular block (for the right side of the frame)\n5. Block 10: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (for bottom of frame)\n6. Block 12: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (for top of frame)\n7. Block 16: Orange triangular block (for inside the frame)\n8. Block 12: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (for the very top layer)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 7 (Green horizontal rectangular base)\nStep2: Move block with index 13 (Orange cylindrical block)\nStep3: Move block with index 8 (Green vertical rectangular block - left side)\nStep4: Move block with index 9 (Green vertical rectangular block - right side)\nStep5: Move block with index 10 (Yellow horizontal rectangular block - frame bottom)\nStep6: Move block with index 16 (Orange triangular block - inside frame)\nStep7: Move block with index 12 (Yellow horizontal rectangular block - frame top)\nStep8: Move block with index 12 (Yellow horizontal rectangular block - top layer)\n}",

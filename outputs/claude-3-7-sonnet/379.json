Green vertical rectangular block - Block index 3\n2. Yellow cylinder - Block index 14\n3. Orange horizontal cylinder - Block index 11\n4. Orange vertical cylinders (3 needed) - Block index 10\n5. Yellow horizontal rectangular block - Block index 7\n6. Yellow half-cylinder - Block index 12\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 14\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 10\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 10\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 12\n}\n```",

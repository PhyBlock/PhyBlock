Bottom layer: Four red arch blocks forming a square base with arches on each side\n2. Second layer: One yellow horizontal rectangular block placed across the red arches\n3. Third layer: Two more red arch blocks with a yellow horizontal rectangular block on top\n4. Fourth layer: Two green vertical rectangular blocks with a yellow horizontal rectangular block on top\n5. Top layer: One orange triangular block (roof piece) positioned on the yellow block\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n- 4× Block #1 (Red arch blocks for bottom layer)\n- 2× Block #1 (Red arch blocks for third layer)\n- 3× Block #8 (Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks)\n- 2× Block #6 (Green vertical rectangular blocks)\n- 1× Block #14 (Orange triangular roof piece)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 8\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n   Step10: Move block with index 6\n   Step11: Move block with index 8\n   Step12: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly proceeds from bottom to top, first creating the base with four red arch blocks, then adding the yellow platforms, the middle red arches, the green vertical supports, and finally topped with the yellow platform and orange triangular roof.",

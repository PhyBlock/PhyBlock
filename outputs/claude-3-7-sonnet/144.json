Second layer: Green rectangular block\n3. Third layer: Blue cube and orange cylinder side by side\n4. Top layer: Two orange triangular roof pieces (one on the blue cube, one on the orange cylinder)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The red arch block forms the base of the structure\n- The green rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the red arch block\n- The blue cube sits on top of the left portion of the green block\n- The orange cylinder stands vertically to the right of the blue cube\n- An orange triangular roof sits atop the blue cube\n- Another orange triangular roof sits atop the orange cylinder\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n1. Block #2 - Red arch block\n2. Block #11 - Green rectangular block\n3. Block #6 - Blue cube\n4. Block #12 - Orange cylinder\n5. Block #15 - Orange triangular roof (for the blue cube)\n6. Block #15 - Orange triangular roof (again, for the orange cylinder)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 11\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n   Step5: Move block with index 15\n   Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order follows a bottom-to-top approach, starting with the base arch, then the green rectangle, followed by the blue cube and orange cylinder, and finally placing the two roof pieces.",

Base layer: Two orange cylindrical pillars standing vertically side by side\n2. Middle layer: A yellow rectangular beam connecting the two orange cylinders horizontally\n3. Upper middle layer: A red arch block sitting on the yellow beam with a yellow half-cylinder (curved block) on top of the arch\n4. Top layer: A tall orange cylindrical tower extending upward with an orange triangular roof piece at the very top\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Block #1: Red arch block (front-facing arch)\n2. Block #5: Yellow rectangular beam (horizontal orientation)\n3. Block #8: Orange cylindrical pillar (vertical orientation) - needed 3 times\n4. Block #9: Yellow half-cylinder (curved roof piece)\n5. Block #15: Orange triangular roof piece\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the ground up, starting with the two base pillars, then adding the connecting beam, the arch with its curved top, the upper tower section, and finally the triangular roof.",

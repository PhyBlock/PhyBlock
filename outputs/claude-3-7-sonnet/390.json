A stack of blocks on the left side\n\nTotal blocks used: 14 blocks\n\nThe structure has multiple layers with different components:\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n### Right Structure (Tower):\n- Base: Two orange cylindrical pillars (index 10) standing vertically\n- Middle section: A yellow rectangular block (index 7) connecting the two pillars\n- Upper section: A red arch block (index 1) on top of the yellow block\n- On top of one pillar: An orange triangular prism (index 14) as the roof\n- A yellow semi-circular block (index 11) is placed inside the red arch\n\n### Left Structure (Stack):\n- Bottom: A red arch block (index 3)\n- Second layer: A green rectangular block (index 4)\n- Third layer: A yellow rectangular block (index 8) with a yellow semi-circular block (index 12) on it\n- Fourth layer: A green rectangular block (index 5)\n- Top: A red arch block (index 1)\n\n# Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nRequired blocks (with indices):\n1. Red arch block (index 1) - used twice\n2. Red arch block (index 3) - used once\n3. Green rectangular block (index 4) - used once\n4. Green rectangular block (index 5) - used once\n5. Yellow rectangular block (index 7) - used once\n6. Yellow rectangular block (index 8) - used once\n7. Orange cylindrical pillar (index 10) - used three times\n8. Yellow semi-circular block (index 11) - used once\n9. Yellow semi-circular block (index 12) - used once\n10. Orange triangular prism (index 14) - used once\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 10\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 14\n   Step8: Move block with index 3\n   Step9: Move block with index 4\n   Step10: Move block with index 8\n   Step11: Move block with index 12\n   Step12: Move block with index 5\n   Step13: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the tower structure (right side) from bottom to top, then constructs the stack (left side) from bottom to top.",

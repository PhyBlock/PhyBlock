Bottom Layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically next to each other\n2. Middle Layer: One yellow rectangular block positioned horizontally across the two orange cylinders\n3. Top Layer: One yellow semi-cylindrical/half-cylindrical block positioned on top of one of the orange cylinders\n\nThe structure resembles a stylized letter \"H\" or a goalpost shape, with the yellow rectangular block connecting the two orange vertical cylinders, and the yellow half-cylinder sitting on top of the left orange cylinder.\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n- 2 orange vertical cylinders (identical to block #7)\n- 1 yellow horizontal rectangular block (identical to block #2)\n- 1 yellow half-cylindrical block (identical to block #11)\n\nThe list of required block indices is:\n- Block #7 (orange vertical cylinder) - needed twice\n- Block #2 (yellow horizontal rectangular block)\n- Block #11 (yellow half-cylindrical block)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with placing the two vertical orange cylinders as the foundation, then places the horizontal yellow rectangular block across them, and finally tops the structure with the yellow half-cylindrical block.",

A tall tower-like structure on the left with:\n   - Orange cylindrical blocks stacked vertically (3 cylinders)\n   - An orange triangular/pyramid top\n   - A red arch/tunnel block in the middle\n   - Yellow rectangular blocks supporting the red arch\n   - A yellow half-cylinder on top of the red arch\n\n2. A vehicle-like structure on the right with:\n   - Two orange horizontal cylinders as a base\n   - A yellow rectangular block across the cylinders\n   - A blue cube on the left side of the yellow rectangle\n   - A yellow half-cylinder on the right side of the yellow rectangle\n\nIn total, there are approximately 12 blocks used across both structures.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\nFor the tower structure:\n- Three orange cylinders stacked vertically\n- Orange pyramid at the very top\n- Red arch/tunnel block attached to the middle of the vertical cylinders\n- Yellow horizontal block passing through the bottom of the red arch and around the orange cylinders\n- Yellow half-cylinder on top of the red arch\n\nFor the vehicle structure:\n- Two orange horizontal cylinders lying parallel on the ground\n- Yellow rectangular block placed horizontally across both orange cylinders\n- Blue cube sitting on the left end of the yellow rectangle\n- Yellow half-cylinder sitting on the right end of the yellow rectangle\n\n# Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Block 1: Red arch/tunnel block\n2. Block 4: Blue cube\n3. Block 5: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (used twice)\n4. Block 7: Orange vertical cylinder (used three times)\n5. Block 8: Orange horizontal cylinder (used twice)\n6. Block 10: Yellow half-cylinder (used twice)\n7. Block 16: Orange triangular/pyramid top\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 7\n   Step9: Move block with index 5\n   Step10: Move block with index 1\n   Step11: Move block with index 10\n   Step12: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first builds the vehicle structure (steps 1-5), then constructs the tower structure (steps 6-12).",

Bottom Layer: A horizontal yellow rectangular block serving as the base\n2. Middle Layer: Two cubic blocks side by side - an orange/reddish block on the left and a red block on the right\n3. Middle Layer (continued): Two cubic blocks above the previous ones - a green block on the left and a blue block on the right\n4. Top Layer: A horizontal yellow rectangular block serving as the top piece\n\nThe structure resembles a small arch or doorway with colored cubic blocks forming the sides and yellow rectangular blocks forming the top and bottom horizontal elements.\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Blue cube (index 1) - placed in the upper right portion\n2. Green cube (index 2) - placed in the upper left portion\n3. Orange/reddish cube (index 3) - placed in the lower left portion\n4. Red cube (index 4) - placed in the lower right portion\n5. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 7) - used for the top\n6. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 7) - used again for the bottom\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on a logical building sequence starting from the bottom:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 1\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis order creates a stable structure by first placing the base, then building the cubic blocks layer by layer, and finally capping with the top horizontal piece.",

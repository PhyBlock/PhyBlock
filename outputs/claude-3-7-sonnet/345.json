      "text": "## Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe main target image shows a colorful block structure resembling a small town or train with buildings. Let me analyze it in detail:\n\n### Block Count and Layers\n- The structure has approximately 20-22 individual blocks\n- It consists of 2 main layers:\n  - Bottom layer: Red arch blocks forming a foundation/bridge\n  - Top layer: Various colored blocks creating structures on top of the foundation\n\n### Spatial Relationships\nThe structure can be described from left to right:\n1. **Left Section**:\n   - Red arch blocks as the base\n   - Green, red, blue, and yellow cubic blocks stacked on top\n\n2. **Middle Section**:\n   - Continues with red arch blocks as the base\n   - Blue cube with a red triangular roof (forming a small house)\n   - Yellow cylindrical blocks\n   - Tall yellow rectangular blocks\n\n3. **Right Section**:\n   - Red arch blocks completing the foundation\n   - Orange/red cube with triangular roof (forming another house)\n   - Green rectangular block at the end\n   - Yellow rectangular blocks\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Red arch block (index 1) - 4 pieces\n2. Red cube (index 6) - 2 pieces\n3. Blue cube (index 3) - 2 pieces\n4. Green cube (index 4) - 2 pieces\n5. Orange/red cube (index 5) - 1 piece\n6. Yellow cube (index 7) - 3 pieces\n7. Green vertical rectangle (index 8) - 2 pieces\n8. Yellow horizontal rectangle (index 9) - 1 piece\n9. Yellow horizontal rectangle (index 10) - 1 piece\n10. Yellow vertical rectangle (index 11) - 2 pieces\n11. Yellow half-cylinder (index 12) - 2 pieces\n12. Yellow cylinder (index 13) - 1 piece\n13. Red triangular roof (index 15) - 1 piece\n14. Orange triangular roof (index 16) - 1 piece\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 1\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 3\n   Step8: Move block with index 7\n   Step9: Move block with index 11\n   Step10: Move block with index 3\n   Step11: Move block with index 15\n   Step12: Move block with index 5\n   Step13: Move block with index 16\n   Step14: Move block with index 11\n   Step15: Move block with index 7\n   Step16: Move block with index 13\n   Step17: Move block with index 12\n   Step18: Move block with index 12\n   Step19: Move block with index 8\n   Step20: Move block with index 4\n   Step21: Move block with index 6\n   Step22: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first creates the foundation with the arch blocks, then builds up each section methodically from left to right, placing the roofs after their supporting blocks.",

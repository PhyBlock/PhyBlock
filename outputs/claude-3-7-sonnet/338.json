Red ramp end pieces (indexes 1 and 3) - These form the left and right ends of the ramp\n2. Red curved ramp middle piece (index 2) - Forms the middle of the ramp where the blue cube sits\n3. Blue cube (index 4) - Sits on the middle of the red ramp\n4. Green vertical rectangular block (index 9) - Forms the vertical \"pole\" on the yellow platform\n5. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (index 10) - Two of these form the platform\n6. Yellow rounded top piece (index 13) - Sits on top of the green vertical block\n7. Orange cylindrical blocks (index 12) - Four of these form the pillars supporting the platform\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 12\n  Step2: Move block with index 12\n  Step3: Move block with index 12\n  Step4: Move block with index 12\n  Step5: Move block with index 10\n  Step6: Move block with index 10\n  Step7: Move block with index 9\n  Step8: Move block with index 13\n  Step9: Move block with index 3\n  Step10: Move block with index 2\n  Step11: Move block with index 1\n  Step12: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts from the bottom up, beginning with the orange pillars, then the yellow platform, the green vertical block with its yellow top, and finally the red ramp structure with the blue cube.",

Left Structure:\n   - Red rectangular block with an arch-shaped hole through it (vertically positioned)\n   - Two blue cubes positioned in front of the arch opening\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - Three orange cylindrical pillars (vertical orientation)\n   - Two yellow rectangular blocks (horizontal orientation) forming a T-shaped top\n   - One orange triangular prism cap on the top of the central pillar\n\n### Block Count and Layers:\n- Total blocks: 8 blocks (2 red blocks, 2 blue blocks, 2 yellow blocks, 3 orange cylindrical pillars, 1 orange triangular cap)\n- Left structure: 3 blocks arranged as 1 red archway with 2 blue cubes in front\n- Right structure: 5 blocks with 3 vertical cylinders, topped by 2 yellow rectangles in a T-formation, with a triangular cap on the tallest cylinder\n\n## Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on the main target image, I'll identify the required blocks from the dictionary:\n\n### Left Structure:\n- Red archway: Block index 1\n- Blue cubes: Block index 3 (used twice)\n\n### Right Structure:\n- Orange cylindrical pillars: Block index 8 (used three times)\n- Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks: \n  - Longer block (top of T): Block index 7\n  - Shorter block (side of T): Block index 5\n- Orange triangular cap: Block index 13\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 8 (central vertical orange cylinder)\nStep2: Move block with index 8 (right vertical orange cylinder)\nStep3: Move block with index 8 (left vertical orange cylinder)\nStep4: Move block with index 7 (long yellow rectangular block across top)\nStep5: Move block with index 5 (short yellow rectangular block on side)\nStep6: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular cap on top)\nStep7: Move block with index 1 (red archway)\nStep8: Move block with index 3 (first blue cube)\nStep9: Move block with index 3 (second blue cube)\n}",

Left Structure:\n   - A red tunnel-like structure with two red blocks with holes\n   - Green and blue blocks placed between the holes\n   - Total: 4 blocks (2 red, 1 green, 1 blue)\n   - 3 layers total\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - A table-like structure with orange cylindrical legs\n   - Yellow rectangular blocks forming the table surface\n   - Blue and green blocks stacked on the table\n   - Yellow semi-cylindrical block on top\n   - Total: 10 blocks (4 orange cylinders, 2 yellow rectangles, 1 green cube, 1 blue cube, 1 yellow semi-cylinder)\n   - 3 layers total\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n\n1. Left Structure:\n   - Red tunnel blocks on top and bottom\n   - Blue cube and green cube in the middle, side by side horizontally\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - Base: 4 orange cylindrical pillars arranged in a square formation\n   - Middle: 2 yellow rectangular blocks placed side by side on top of the pillars\n   - Top: Green cube on bottom, blue cube above it, yellow semi-cylindrical block on top\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\n## Required Blocks:\n1. Left Structure:\n   - Index 1: Red tunnel block (top)\n   - Index 2: Red tunnel block (bottom)\n   - Index 5: Blue cube\n   - Index 6: Green cube\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - Index 8: Orange cylindrical pillar (4 times)\n   - Index 7: Yellow rectangular block (2 times)\n   - Index 6: Green cube\n   - Index 5: Blue cube\n   - Index 11: Yellow semi-cylindrical block\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 5\n   Step9: Move block with index 11\n   Step10: Move block with index 2\n   Step11: Move block with index 6\n   Step12: Move block with index 5\n   Step13: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the right structure (table with objects on top) from bottom to top, then constructs the left structure (tunnel) from bottom to top.",

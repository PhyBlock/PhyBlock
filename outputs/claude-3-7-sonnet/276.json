Red arch blocks (indexes 1, 2) for the base of left structure\n2. Red c-shaped tunnel blocks (indexes 5, 7) for the right structure\n3. Red rectangular tunnel block (similar to index 6) for the top of right structure\n4. Blue cubic blocks (indexes 8, 10, 11) for both structures\n5. Green cubic blocks (index 9) for the top of left structure\n6. Yellow rectangular block (index 12) for the middle layer of left structure\n7. Orange triangular roof piece (index 16) for the top of left structure\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 12\n   Step4: Move block with index 9\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 16\n   Step8: Move block with index 7\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n   Step10: Move block with index 8\n   Step11: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n\nNote: The left structure appears to be built from the ground up, starting with the arch blocks, then the yellow block, green blocks, blue block, and finally the orange roof. The right structure follows a similar bottom-up approach.",

      "text": "# Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure contains multiple building blocks arranged in several distinct formations. The structure has approximately 13 blocks in total, with up to 2-3 layers at some points.\n\n## Structure Description:\n1. On the left side: A small house-like structure made of:\n   - A yellow cube and a red cube on the bottom layer\n   - A green rectangular block in the middle\n   - Two orange triangular blocks forming a roof on top\n\n2. In the center-right area: A complex structure consisting of:\n   - Two red arch-shaped blocks on the bottom layer\n   - A yellow long rectangular block connecting them\n   - Two blue cubes positioned above - one directly on the yellow block and one slightly behind it\n   - Another blue triangular prism\n   - A green rectangular block with an orange triangular block on top (forming another small roof)\n\n## Block Selection from Dictionary:\nBased on the dictionary image, I need to select the following blocks:\n\n- Red arch blocks (indices 1 and 2)\n- Blue cubes (index 3, used twice)\n- Green cubes (index 4)\n- Red cubes (index 5)\n- Yellow cubes (index 6)\n- Green rectangular blocks (indices 7 and 8)\n- Yellow long rectangular blocks (indices 9, 10, 11, or 12 - need to select the correct orientation)\n- Orange triangular elements (indices 14, 15, and 16 - need to select the correct orientation)\n- Blue triangular prism (not clearly visible in the dictionary, but needed)\n\n## Assembly Order:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 11\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 3\n   Step8: Move block with index 3\n   Step9: Move block with index 8\n   Step10: Move block with index 14\n   Step11: Move block with index 7\n   Step12: Move block with index 15\n   Step13: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nNote: For the blue triangular prism that appears to be part of the structure, I don't see a perfect match in the block dictionary provided. I've done my best to match the visible blocks based on color, shape, and orientation as shown in both images.",

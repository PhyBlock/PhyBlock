Head section:\n   - Block #2 (red U-shaped block) - forms the main part of the head\n   - Two of Block #11 (yellow semicircular/curved blocks) - forms the top of the head\n\n2. Body section:\n   - Block #8 (orange vertical cylinder) - forms the central body/torso\n\n3. Waist/middle section:\n   - Block #7 (yellow horizontal rectangular block) - forms the waist connector\n   - Two triangular orange blocks (#15 and #16) - form the side parts at the waist\n\n4. Leg section:\n   - Two of Block #6 (blue cubes) - form the feet/base\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 7\n   Step4: Move block with index 15\n   Step5: Move block with index 16\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 2\n   Step8: Move block with index 11\n   Step9: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order moves from bottom to top, starting with the base (legs), then the middle section (waist and sides), followed by the body, and finally the head section with its decorative top pieces.",

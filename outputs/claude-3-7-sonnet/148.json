Base layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks (pillars)\n2. Second layer: Two yellow rectangular blocks forming a horizontal platform\n3. Third layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks stacked on top of the taller pillar\n4. Top layer: One orange triangular prism (roof)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- There are two orange cylindrical pillars of different heights standing vertically\n- The taller pillar on the left has three segments: bottom support, middle section, and top section\n- The shorter pillar on the right has a single segment\n- Two yellow rectangular blocks form an L-shaped platform connecting the two pillars\n- The longer yellow block extends from the taller pillar toward the right\n- The shorter yellow block runs perpendicular to the first, connecting to the shorter pillar\n- An orange triangular prism (roof) sits on top of the tallest pillar\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n- Block 6: Orange vertical cylinder (used 3 times for the taller pillar and once for the shorter pillar)\n- Block 2: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (longer segment of the platform)\n- Block 1: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (shorter segment of the platform, rotated 90Â° relative to block 2)\n- Block 12: Orange triangular prism (roof)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly begins with placing the vertical cylinders to form the pillars (4 orange cylinders total), followed by the yellow horizontal blocks that form the platform, and finally the triangular roof at the top.",

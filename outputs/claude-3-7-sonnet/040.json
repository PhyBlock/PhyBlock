For the top layer: Red arch block with cutout facing forward (Block #1)\n2. For the middle layer: Blue cube (Block #9) and Green cube (Block #10)\n3. For the bottom layer: Red arch block with cutout facing forward (Block #1)\n\nNote that I'm using Block #1 twice, as the same red arch piece appears at both the top and bottom of the structure.\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from top to bottom, starting with the top red arch, then placing the blue and green cubes in the middle layer, and finishing with the bottom red arch block.",

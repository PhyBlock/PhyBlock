Blue cube (index 1) - needed for both structures\n2. Green cube (index 2) - needed for the left structure\n3. Orange cylinder (horizontal orientation, indices 10 and 11) - needed for vehicle base\n4. Yellow half-cylinder (index 12) - needed as base of left structure\n5. Yellow cube (index 5) - not directly visible in the main structure\n6. Yellow rectangular blocks (indices 6, 7, 8) - needed for the vehicle structure\n\n# Assembly Instructions\n\nI'll now provide the step-by-step assembly sequence for constructing both structures:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first builds the vehicle structure on the right (steps 1-5), then constructs the simpler structure on the left (steps 6-9).",

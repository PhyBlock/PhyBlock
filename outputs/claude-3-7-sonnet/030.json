The red U-shaped block on top matches block index 3\n2. The orange cylindrical block in the center matches block index 7\n3. The orange triangular/wedge-shaped block on the left matches block index 13\n4. The orange triangular/wedge-shaped block on the right matches block index 15\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 15\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the central cylindrical block as the foundation, then adds the two triangular supports on either side, and finally places the U-shaped block on top to complete the structure.",

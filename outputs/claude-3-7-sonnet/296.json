Red arch blocks (base of bridge): Block #1 (used twice)\n2. Red cube blocks (house base and train middle): Block #5 (used 2-3 times)\n3. Blue cube blocks (houses and train top): Block #3 (used 2-3 times)\n4. Orange cylindrical wheels: Block #10 (used twice)\n5. Green rectangular blocks (train base and supports): Block #6 (used twice) and Block #7 (used twice)\n6. Yellow rectangular tall blocks (buildings): Block #9 (used twice)\n7. Yellow half-cylinder blocks: Block #11 (used twice)\n8. Orange triangular roof pieces: Block #15 and #16 (used for roofs)\n9. Yellow small cylinder: Block #12 (possibly used)\n10. Yellow rectangular flat pieces: Block #8 (possibly used)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 5\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 3\n    Step10: Move block with index 15\n    Step11: Move block with index 16\n    Step12: Move block with index 7\n    Step13: Move block with index 7\n    Step14: Move block with index 9\n    Step15: Move block with index 9\n    Step16: Move block with index 10\n    Step17: Move block with index 10\n    Step18: Move block with index 6\n    Step19: Move block with index 6\n    Step20: Move block with index 5\n    Step21: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the base structures (arches), builds the buildings and bridge elements, then constructs the vehicle/train component, following a bottom-to-top approach for each section.",

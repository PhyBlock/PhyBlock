Block index 1: Red arch block (left side of the structure)\n2. Block index 2: Red arch block (right side of the structure)\n3. Block index 14: Yellow semicircular block (left side, on top of arch)\n4. Block index 14: Yellow semicircular block (right side, on top of arch)\n5. Block index 11: Tall yellow rectangular block (left back)\n6. Block index 11: Tall yellow rectangular block (right back)\n7. Block index 8: Tall green rectangular block (left back corner)\n8. Block index 8: Tall green rectangular block (right back corner)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 2\n  Step3: Move block with index 14\n  Step4: Move block with index 14\n  Step5: Move block with index 11\n  Step6: Move block with index 11\n  Step7: Move block with index 8\n  Step8: Move block with index 8\n}\n\nThe assembly begins with the base arch blocks, followed by the semicircular blocks that rest on them, then the tall yellow blocks behind them, and finally the green blocks at the back corners to complete the structure.",

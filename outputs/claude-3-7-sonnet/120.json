The orange cylinder is placed horizontally across the top of the green rectangular block.\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks:\n- Block with index 11: Yellow upright cylinder\n- Block with index 3: Green vertical rectangular block\n- Block with index 8: Orange horizontal cylinder\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nTo reconstruct the target structure, I would assemble the blocks in the following order (from bottom to top):\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 11\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order places the yellow cylinder first as part of the base, then positions the green rectangular block next to it, and finally places the orange horizontal cylinder on top of the green block to complete the structure.",

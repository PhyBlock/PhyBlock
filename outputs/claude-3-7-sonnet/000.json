Base Layer: A red arch block (U-shaped) that forms the foundation\n2. Middle Layer: A blue cube sits on top of the left side of the red arch\n3. Middle Layer (additional): A yellow half-cylinder sits on top of the right side of the red arch\n4. Top Layer: An orange triangular roof piece sits on top of the blue cube\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nLooking at the block dictionary, I can identify the exact blocks needed:\n\n1. Red arch block: Block #1 - This is the red U-shaped block with the arch opening facing forward\n2. Blue cube: Block #5 - A simple blue cube\n3. Yellow half-cylinder: Block #7 - A yellow half-cylinder oriented horizontally\n4. Orange triangular roof: Block #12 - An orange triangular roof piece\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nBased on the structure shown in the target image, here is the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 5\n  Step3: Move block with index 7\n  Step4: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly begins with placing the red arch as the foundation, then placing the blue cube on the left side of the arch, adding the yellow half-cylinder on the right side of the arch, and finally placing the orange triangular roof on top of the blue cube to complete the structure.",

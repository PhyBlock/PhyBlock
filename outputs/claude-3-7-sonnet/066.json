Green rectangular block in horizontal orientation (Block index 2)\n2. Orange cylindrical block in vertical orientation (Block index 5)\n3. Orange triangular/pyramidal roof piece (Block index 11)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 2\n  Step2: Move block with index 5\n  Step3: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order follows a bottom-to-top approach, starting with the green base, adding the orange cylindrical column, and finishing with the triangular roof to complete the house-like structure.",

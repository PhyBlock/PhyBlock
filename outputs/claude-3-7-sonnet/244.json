A larger structure on the right (resembling a building with arches and towers)\n\n### Block Count and Layers:\n- Total blocks used: Approximately 15 blocks\n- The structures have multiple layers (base, middle, and top layers)\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\nThe left structure has:\n- A red base block with a circular hole\n- Yellow cylindrical/semi-circular blocks on top\n- An orange triangular roof block\n\nThe right structure has:\n- A red base with multiple arch openings\n- An orange cylindrical tower in the middle\n- Yellow rectangular blocks forming walls\n- A green rectangular block on the right side\n- An orange triangular roof on top of the tower\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\nFor the left structure:\n- Block 3 (red block with circular opening)\n- Block 12 (yellow semi-circular block) - used twice\n- Block 15 (orange triangular roof)\n\nFor the right structure:\n- Block 1 (red block with arch) - used once\n- Block 2 (red block with arch) - used once\n- Block 5 (red block with arch) - used once\n- Block 6 (green vertical rectangular block)\n- Block 10 (yellow vertical rectangular block) - used twice\n- Block 11 (orange cylindrical tower)\n- Block 8 or 9 (yellow horizontal rectangular block) - used once\n- Block 15 (orange triangular roof)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 12 \n    Step4: Move block with index 15\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 5\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 8\n    Step12: Move block with index 6\n    Step13: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first creates the left tower structure, and then proceeds to build the right, larger structure from the base up to the roof.",

A circular tunnel-like structure on the right\n\nIn total, there are approximately 13 building blocks used across 3 main layers:\n- Bottom layer: Red arch blocks and red tunnel blocks\n- Middle layer: Yellow semicircular blocks, green rectangular blocks\n- Top layer: Yellow tall blocks, blue cubic block, orange cubic block\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n### Left Section (Train):\n- Base: Two red arch blocks (1, 2) positioned side by side\n- Middle: Two yellow semicircular blocks (13, 14) placed on top of the red arches\n- Top front: Blue cubic block (5) on the left, green rectangular block (10) in middle-right\n- Top rear: Two tall yellow blocks (11, 11) at the back, with an orange cubic block (6) in middle-front\n\n### Right Section (Tunnel):\n- Two red block frames with circular holes (4, 4) stacked vertically\n- A horizontal green rectangular block (7) placed between them\n\n# Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the main target image, I need the following blocks:\n- Block 1: Red arch block (used once on left side of train)\n- Block 2: Red arch block facing right (used once on right side of train)\n- Block 4: Red circular frame block (used twice in the tunnel structure)\n- Block 5: Blue cubic block (used once at front-top of train)\n- Block 6: Orange cubic block (used once in middle of train top)\n- Block 7: Green horizontal rectangular block (used once in tunnel)\n- Block 8: Green vertical rectangular block (used once at back of train)\n- Block 9: Green vertical rectangular block (used once in train structure)\n- Block 11: Yellow tall rectangular block (used twice at rear-top of train)\n- Block 13: Yellow semicircular block (used once on train)\n- Block 14: Yellow semicircular block (used once on train)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n    Step11: Move block with index 11\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 7\n    Step14: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the train structure first (steps 1-11) and then constructs the tunnel structure (steps 12-14), proceeding generally from bottom to top for both sections.",

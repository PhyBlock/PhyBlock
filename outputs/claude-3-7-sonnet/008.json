There are multiple layers, with blocks placed both beside and on top of each other.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The central part of the structure consists of a tall orange cylindrical block with a triangular prism (like a roof) on top.\n- To the left of the central block is a blue cubic block with a triangular orange prism leaning against it.\n- To the right of the central block is another blue cubic block with an orange triangular prism leaning against it.\n- The blocks are arranged to create a house-like structure with the center \"tower\" and side elements.\n\n# Selection of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Blue cubic blocks (indices 1, 2, or 3 - they look similar in orientation)\n2. Orange cylindrical block (index 4)\n3. Orange triangular prisms (indices 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16 - depending on exact orientation)\n\nLooking more carefully at the orientations, I need:\n- 2 blue cubic blocks (index 2)\n- 1 vertical orange cylindrical block (index 4)\n- 2 triangular prisms oriented similar to index 11\n- 1 triangular prism similar to index 12\n- 1 triangular prism on top similar to index 16\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4\n   Step2: Move block with index 16\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 11\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the central cylindrical block, adds the roof, and then builds out the side elements with the cubic blocks and triangular prisms to complete the house-like structure.",

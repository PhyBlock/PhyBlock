      "text": "## Analysis of the Main Target Image\n\nThe target structure consists of a vertical tower with 5 layers:\n\n1. Bottom Layer: A red rectangular block with a semicircular tunnel or hole through it\n2. Second Layer from Bottom: A green rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n3. Middle Layer: Contains two cube blocks side by side - a blue cube on the left and a yellow cube on the right\n4. Fourth Layer: A green rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n5. Top Layer: A red rectangular block with a semicircular tunnel or hole through it (identical to the bottom layer)\n\nTotal number of blocks: 6 blocks\n\nSpatial relationships:\n- The two red blocks with tunnels are at the top and bottom of the structure\n- The green rectangular blocks are placed between the other blocks as connecting layers\n- In the middle layer, the blue and yellow cubes are positioned side by side to form a rectangular shape\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. For the top and bottom layers: Red rectangular blocks with tunnels (identical pieces)\n   - Block with index 1 appears to be the correct block, as it shows a red rectangular block with a semicircular tunnel\n   \n2. For the second and fourth layers: Green rectangular blocks in horizontal orientation\n   - Block with index 16 shows a green rectangular block in the required horizontal orientation\n   \n3. For the middle layer: \n   - Block with index 8 shows a blue cube\n   - Block with index 11 shows a yellow cube\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nStarting from the bottom and building up:\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 16\n  Step3: Move block with index 8\n  Step4: Move block with index 11\n  Step5: Move block with index 16\n  Step6: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, creating the exact tower shown in the main target image.",

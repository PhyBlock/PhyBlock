Two red arch blocks - Block indices #1 and #2 (oriented to form a pair)\n2. Two green horizontal rectangular blocks - Block index #6 (used twice)\n3. One yellow horizontal rectangular block - Block index #8\n4. One orange vertical cylindrical block - Block index #10\n5. One orange triangular roof - Block index #14\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the ground up, creating a stable base with the arches first, then adding the green rectangles, followed by the yellow block, the cylindrical tower, and finally the triangular roof.",

Green horizontal rectangular block (index 1) - for left structure base\n2. Green vertical rectangular blocks (index 2) - two of these for right structure base\n3. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 7) - for right structure middle layer\n4. Orange cylindrical columns (index 8) - two of these for both structures\n5. Yellow half-cylinder (index 11) - for right structure roof\n6. Orange triangular block (index 15) - for left structure roof\n\n# Assembly Instructions\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 15\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 7\n   Step7: Move block with index 8\n   Step8: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order follows a logical construction approach, building the left structure first (steps 1-3), then building the right structure from the ground up (steps 4-8).",

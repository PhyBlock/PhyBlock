Base layer: Four orange cylindrical pillars supporting a yellow rectangular platform\n2. Middle layer: Two cube blocks (green and blue) stacked vertically on the yellow platform\n3. Top layer: A yellow semi-cylindrical roof piece on top of the blue cube\n\nTotal blocks: 8 blocks (4 orange cylinders, 1 yellow rectangular platform, 1 green cube, 1 blue cube, and 1 yellow semi-cylindrical roof)\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nLooking at the block dictionary, I can identify the following needed blocks:\n\n1. Blue cube - Block index 1\n2. Green cube - Block index 2\n3. Yellow rectangular horizontal piece - Block index 4 (used for the platform)\n4. Orange cylindrical piece - Block index 9 (used for the pillars, needed 4 times)\n5. Yellow semi-cylindrical piece - Block index 10 (used for the roof)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nThe structure should be built from bottom to top for stability:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 9\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 2\n   Step7: Move block with index 1\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with placing the four cylindrical pillars, then placing the rectangular platform on top of them, followed by stacking the green cube, then the blue cube, and finally placing the semi-cylindrical roof piece on top.",

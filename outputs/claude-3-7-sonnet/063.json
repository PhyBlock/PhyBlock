For the bottom layer: Two red arch blocks - blocks with indices 1 and 2\n2. For the middle layer: \n   - Two green vertical rectangular blocks - blocks with indices 8 and 9\n   - Two yellow horizontal rectangular blocks - blocks with indices 10 and 12\n3. For the top layer: One orange triangular block - block with index 15\n\nSo the list of required block indices is: 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 9\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n   Step7: Move block with index 15\n}",

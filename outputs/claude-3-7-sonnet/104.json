Blue cube - matches block index 1\n2. Yellow rectangular block (horizontal orientation) - matches block index 7\n3. Two orange cylindrical blocks (horizontal orientation) - matches block index 14 (needed twice)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nThe logical assembly order would be bottom to top:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis will create the cart structure with the orange cylinders as wheels at the bottom, the yellow rectangular block as the platform in the middle, and the blue cube on top.",

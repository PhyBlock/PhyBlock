There are two distinct structures:\n\n1. A taller tower-like structure on the right:\n   - Base: Three orange cylindrical pillars\n   - Middle: A yellow rectangular block supporting a red arch structure\n   - Top: Another orange cylindrical pillar with an orange triangular roof\n\n2. A smaller house-like structure on the left:\n   - Red archway base\n   - Orange sloping roof sections\n\n### Block Count and Layers\n- Total blocks used: 11 blocks\n- The tower structure has 4 distinct layers\n- The separate house structure has 2 layers\n\n### Spatial Relationships\n- Tower structure: Three vertical orange cylinders form the base, with a yellow horizontal beam across them supporting a red archway structure with a yellow half-cylinder, topped by another orange cylinder and an orange triangular roof.\n- House structure: A red archway base with orange roof pieces arranged in a sloping pattern.\n\n## Selected Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Tower Structure:\n   - Three orange cylindrical pillars (Block #9)\n   - One yellow horizontal beam (Block #6)\n   - One red archway structure (Block #2)\n   - One yellow half-cylinder piece (Block #11)\n   - One more orange cylindrical pillar (Block #9)\n   - One orange triangular roof piece (Block #15)\n\n2. Separate House Structure:\n   - One red archway base (Block #2)\n   - Three orange triangular roof pieces (Block #16)\n\n## Block Indices List\n- Block #2 (used twice)\n- Block #6 (used once)\n- Block #9 (used four times)\n- Block #11 (used once)\n- Block #15 (used once)\n- Block #16 (used three times)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n   Step9: Move block with index 2\n   Step10: Move block with index 16\n   Step11: Move block with index 16\n   Step12: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the tower structure from bottom to top, then creates the separate house structure.",

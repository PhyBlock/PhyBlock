Blue rectangular block (index 1) - for the top of the right structure\n2. Green rectangular blocks (indices 3, 4, 5) - for the frame sides and base\n3. Yellow rectangular blocks (indices 6, 7, 9) - for horizontal supports\n4. Orange cylindrical blocks (index 10) - for the vertical supports\n5. Orange triangular roof blocks (indices 14, 15, 16) - for the roof elements\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 10\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 14\n   Step4: Move block with index 7\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 14\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 14\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 5\n   Step11: Move block with index 4\n   Step12: Move block with index 4\n   Step13: Move block with index 9\n   Step14: Move block with index 9\n   Step15: Move block with index 15\n   Step16: Move block with index 3\n   Step17: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds from the bottom up, starting with the left tower structure and then moving to the right frame structure, completing the entire target formation.",

Block 1: Red arch-shaped block with an opening - this is the base of the house\n2. Block 11: Orange triangular block - for one side of the roof\n3. Block 12: Orange triangular block - for the other side of the roof\n\nThe red arch block (index 1) perfectly matches the base of the structure. The two orange triangular blocks (indices 11 and 12) properly match the orientation of the roof pieces in the target image.\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence places the foundation first (the red arch), then adds the two triangular roof pieces one after another to complete the structure.",

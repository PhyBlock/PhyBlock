Two red arch blocks (with curved openings) side by side as the base\n2. Above the red blocks:\n   - A blue cube on the left front\n   - Two yellow tall rectangular blocks in the center back\n   - One yellow half-cylinder in the center front\n   - Two green rectangular blocks (one vertical tall, one shorter) on the right side\n   - One orange cube on the right front\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Red arch block with opening facing left (index 1)\n2. Red arch block with opening facing right (index 2)\n3. Blue cube (index 5)\n4. Orange cube (index 6)\n5. Green vertical rectangular block (index 9)\n6. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 10)\n7. Yellow vertical rectangular block (index 11) - needed twice\n8. Yellow half-cylinder (index 15)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 15\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 10\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the base (red arch blocks), then builds upward with the front blue cube, the yellow half-cylinder, the two tall yellow blocks at the back, followed by the green blocks on the right side, and finally the orange cube.",

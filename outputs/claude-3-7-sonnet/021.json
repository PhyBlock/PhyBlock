Two red arch blocks (indices 1 and 4)\n2. One red connector block (index 7)\n3. One yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 10)\n4. Two green cube blocks (index 6, used twice)\n5. One blue rectangular block (index 8)\n6. One orange triangular/roof block (index 16)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the base arch blocks, then adding the connecting piece, followed by the yellow platform, the green cubes, the blue block, and finally the orange roof piece.",

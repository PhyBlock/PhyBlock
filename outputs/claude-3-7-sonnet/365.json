Green rectangular block (top): Block #11\n2. Yellow vertical rectangular blocks (sides): Blocks #14 and #15\n3. Blue cube (inside): Block #7\n4. Red cube (inside): Block #9\n5. Green rectangular block (bottom): Block #11\n\nFor the Ramp Structure:\n1. Red U-shaped ramp: Block #3\n2. Blue cube: Block #7\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 15\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first builds the tower structure from bottom to top, then creates the separate ramp structure with the blue cube on top.",

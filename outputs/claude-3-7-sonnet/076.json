Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (for top and bottom): Blocks with indices 13 or 14 (they appear identical)\n2. Green vertical rectangular blocks (for sides): Blocks with indices 9 or 10 (they appear identical)\n3. Red blocks with curved cutouts (for circular opening): Blocks with indices 1, 2, 5, and 6\n\nSpecifically, the blocks needed are:\n- Block 13 (yellow horizontal rectangle) - 2 pieces\n- Block 9 (green vertical rectangle) - 2 pieces\n- Block 1 (red block with curved cutout) - 1 piece\n- Block 2 (red block with curved cutout) - 1 piece\n- Block 5 (red block with curved cutout) - 1 piece\n- Block 6 (red block with curved cutout) - 1 piece\n\n# Assembly Order\n\nStarting from the bottom layer and working up:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence places the bottom yellow block first, then adds the vertical supports and red center pieces that form the circular opening, and finally caps the structure with the top yellow block.",

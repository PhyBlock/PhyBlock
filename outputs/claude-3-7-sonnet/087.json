Bottom layer: 3 green blocks forming a base (2 rectangular blocks and 1 cube)\n2. Second layer: 1 yellow horizontal rectangular block\n3. Third layer: 3 blocks forming a house structure (1 blue cube, 1 red cube, and 1 green horizontal rectangular block)\n4. Top layer: 2 orange triangular/roof blocks\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- Base layer: Two green rectangular blocks (one horizontally and one vertically oriented) with a green cube between them forming a U-shaped base\n- Second layer: A yellow rectangular block sits horizontally across the green base\n- Third layer: On top of the yellow block sits a small house-like structure with a blue cube on the left, a red cube on the right, and a green horizontal rectangular block across the top\n- Top layer: Two orange triangular roof pieces sit on top of the green rectangular block to form a peaked roof\n\n# Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target structure, I need the following blocks:\n1. Blue cube (index 1) - used for the left side of the house\n2. Green cube (index 2) - used for the central base \n3. Red cube (index 3) - used for the right side of the house\n4. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 8) - used for the second layer\n5. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 5) - used for the bottom left of base\n6. Green vertical rectangular block (index 6) - used for the bottom right of base\n7. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 7) - used for the top of the house\n8. Orange triangular roof blocks (indexes 11 and 12) - used for the roof\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 3\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with the base level and builds upward layer by layer, which is the most stable way to construct this structure.",

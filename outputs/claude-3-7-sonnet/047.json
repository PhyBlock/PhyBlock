Bottom layer: Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n2. Second layer: Red block with a circular hole\n3. Middle layer: Yellow horizontal rectangular block\n4. Fourth layer: Two green vertical rectangular blocks side by side\n5. Top layer: Yellow horizontal rectangular block with an orange triangular block on top\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- The bottom yellow rectangular block (layer 1) serves as the base\n- The red block with a circular hole sits directly on the bottom yellow block (layer 2)\n- Another yellow rectangular block is placed on top of the red block (layer 3)\n- Two green vertical rectangular blocks stand side by side on the middle yellow block (layer 4)\n- The top yellow rectangular block rests on both green blocks (layer 5)\n- An orange triangular block is positioned on the top yellow block, slightly to the right\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the blocks needed from the dictionary are:\n1. Red block with circular hole - block index 1\n2. Green vertical rectangular blocks (2 needed) - block index 6 and 7\n3. Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (3 needed) - block index 9\n4. Orange triangular block - block index 15\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n}\n```",

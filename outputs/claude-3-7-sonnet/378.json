A larger structure resembling a small house or arch with 3 distinct layers:\n   - Bottom layer: Two green vertical pillars\n   - Middle layer: A yellow horizontal beam\n   - Top layer: A red arch block with an orange triangular roof\n\n2. A smaller structure to the right side:\n   - A single red arch block with an orange triangular roof (identical to the top of the larger structure)\n\nIn total, there are 6 building blocks used (4 for the larger structure and 2 for the smaller structure).\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- **Larger Structure**:\n  - Two green vertical pillars (blocks) stand parallel to each other, forming the base\n  - A yellow horizontal beam sits on top of the two green pillars, connecting them\n  - A red arch block sits on top of the yellow beam\n  - An orange triangular roof piece sits atop the red arch block\n\n- **Smaller Structure**:\n  - A red arch block stands alone\n  - An orange triangular roof piece sits atop the red arch block\n\n# Selection of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. For the green vertical pillars: Two identical green vertical blocks (index 4)\n2. For the yellow horizontal beam: A horizontal yellow rectangular block (index 8)\n3. For the red arch blocks: Two identical red arch blocks (index 1)\n4. For the orange triangular roofs: Two identical orange triangular blocks (index 13)\n\n## Required Block Indices:\n- Index 4: Green vertical rectangular block (used twice)\n- Index 8: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (used once)\n- Index 1: Red arch block (used twice)\n- Index 13: Orange triangular roof block (used twice)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\nBased on the physical stability and construction logic, here's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4\n   Step2: Move block with index 4\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 13\n   Step6: Move block with index 1\n   Step7: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence first builds the base of the larger structure with the green pillars, adds the yellow beam, completes the larger structure with the red arch and orange roof, and finally creates the smaller structure with the red arch and orange roof.",

Yellow vertical column - matches block #8\n2. Green horizontal rectangles (top and bottom) - match block #6 (used twice)\n\n## Right Structure Blocks:\n1. Red arch - matches block #1\n2. Orange cylindrical pillars - match block #10 (used twice)\n3. Green horizontal rectangle - matches block #6\n4. Blue cube - matches block #4\n5. Orange triangular roof - matches block #13\n\n# Assembly Order\n\nFor a logical assembly order, I'll start with the foundation of each structure and build upward:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 10\n   Step3: Move block with index 10\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 13\n   Step7: Move block with index 6\n   Step8: Move block with index 8\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first builds the right structure (steps 1-6) from bottom to top, then builds the left structure (steps 7-9) from bottom to top.",

Let me analyze this structure in detail:\n\n### Count & Layers:\n- Total blocks: 7 blocks\n- Number of layers: 4 distinct layers (base layer, middle layer, rectangular green layer, and roof layer)\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- Base layer (bottom): Two blocks - a blue cube on the left and a blue cube on the right\n- Second layer (middle): Two blocks - an orange cube on the left and an orange cube on the right\n- Third layer: One horizontal green rectangular block spanning across the entire width\n- Top/roof layer: Two orange triangular/roof pieces forming a peaked roof\n\n## Selection of Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Blue cubes (index 1) - 2 of these for the base layer\n2. Orange cubes (index 3) - 2 of these for the second layer\n3. Green horizontal rectangle (index 7) - 1 of these for the third layer\n4. Orange roof/triangular pieces (index 12) - 2 of these for the top roof layer\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nFollowing a bottom-up construction approach:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence starts with placing the blue cube base, adds the orange cube middle section, places the green rectangular layer, and finally tops it with the orange triangular roof pieces.",

Red arch block with opening on one side (index 1) - used once\n2. Red arch block with opening on one side, rotated 180° (index 2) - used once\n3. Red arch block with curved inner corner (index 3) - used once\n4. Red arch block with curved inner corner, different orientation (index 4) - used once\n5. Red cube/rectangular block (index 5) - used once\n6. Blue cube (index 6) - used once\n7. Green cube (index 7) - used once\n8. Orange triangular prism/roof piece (index 15) - used once\n9. Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 9) - used twice\n10. Yellow horizontal rectangular block, slightly different orientation (index 10) - used once\n11. Yellow horizontal rectangular block, another orientation (index 12) - used once\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 6\n  Step2: Move block with index 9\n  Step3: Move block with index 15\n  Step4: Move block with index 7\n  Step5: Move block with index 5\n  Step6: Move block with index 1\n  Step7: Move block with index 2\n  Step8: Move block with index 3\n  Step9: Move block with index 4\n  Step10: Move block with index 9\n  Step11: Move block with index 10\n  Step12: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence first builds the left structure (steps 1-5) and then constructs the right structure (steps 6-12), starting with the base arch blocks and finishing with the yellow blocks on top.",

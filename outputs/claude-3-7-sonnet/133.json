Red arch blocks: Block indices 1 and 2 (for the bottom layer)\n2. Green rectangular blocks: Block indices 10 and 10 (for the top layer)\n3. Yellow tall blocks: Block indices 14 and 15 (for the top layer)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 2\n  Step3: Move block with index 14\n  Step4: Move block with index 10\n  Step5: Move block with index 15\n  Step6: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the bottom layer (the two red arch blocks side by side), followed by adding the blocks in the top layer from left to right (yellow tall block, green rectangular block, yellow tall block, green rectangular block).",

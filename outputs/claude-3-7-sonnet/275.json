Block 1: Red arched tunnel block (used 2 times)\n2. Block 3: Blue cube\n3. Block 5: Red cube \n4. Block 6: Yellow cube\n5. Block 7: Green rectangular block\n6. Block 8: Yellow long rectangular block (used 3 times)\n7. Block 11: Orange cylindrical block (used 3 times)\n8. Block 12: Yellow half-cylinder\n9. Block 14, 15, or 16: Orange triangular roof blocks (used 3 times, they appear similar but I'll use #15 for consistency)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 1\n   Step4: Move block with index 8\n   Step5: Move block with index 3\n   Step6: Move block with index 5\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n   Step9: Move block with index 11\n   Step10: Move block with index 11\n   Step11: Move block with index 11\n   Step12: Move block with index 15\n   Step13: Move block with index 10\n   Step14: Move block with index 1\n   Step15: Move block with index 12\n   Step16: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the left tower first (steps 1-8), then creates the right structure (steps 9-16), following a logical bottom-to-top construction sequence for each component.",

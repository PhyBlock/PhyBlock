A small house structure on the left with 4 layers:\n   - Bottom layer: Red arch block\n   - Second layer: Green rectangular block\n   - Third layer: Blue cube\n   - Top layer: Orange triangular roof\n\n2. A larger tower structure on the right with multiple components:\n   - Three vertical orange cylindrical pillars (one tall central pillar, two shorter pillars on either side)\n   - Two yellow rectangular blocks forming a cross shape\n   - Two yellow cube-shaped rooms with orange triangular roofs on top\n\nTotal number of blocks used: 14 blocks\n\n## Selected Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nFor the left small house:\n- Block #2: Red arch block (bottom)\n- Block #5 or #7: Green rectangular block (middle layer)\n- Block #3: Blue cube (third layer)\n- Block #14: Orange triangular roof (top)\n\nFor the right tower structure:\n- Block #10: Orange cylindrical pillars (3 of these)\n- Block #8 and #9: Yellow rectangular blocks (for the cross structure)\n- Block #15: Yellow cube with orange triangular roof (2 of these)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 7\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 14\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 10\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 15\n   Step9: Move block with index 15\n   Step10: Move block with index 8\n   Step11: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n\nNote: I've selected block #7 for the green rectangular block in the small house as it appears to be the correct orientation based on the main image. For the yellow structure, blocks #8 and #9 create the cross-shaped platform that holds the two yellow cube structures with triangular roofs (block #15).",

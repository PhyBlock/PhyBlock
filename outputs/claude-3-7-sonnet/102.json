Blue cube (index 6) - for the bottom left\n2. Orange/red cube (index 7) - for the bottom right\n3. Red block with semicircular cutout (index 3) - for the second layer\n4. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 10) - for the third layer\n5. Orange triangular prism/roof (index 15) - for the top layer\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 6\n  Step2: Move block with index 7\n  Step3: Move block with index 3\n  Step4: Move block with index 10\n  Step5: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nThis order follows a bottom-to-top assembly approach, starting with the base and working upward to complete the structure.",

The structure appears to be composed of 4 identical blocks that create a square-shaped frame with a circular opening in the center. The structure has:\n- Total blocks: 4\n- Total layers: 1 (all blocks are arranged in a single horizontal layer)\n- Spatial arrangement: The blocks are arranged in a square pattern, with each block forming one quarter of the circular opening. Each block is positioned at a 90-degree rotation from its adjacent blocks to complete the circular hole.\n\n## Selecting Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nLooking at the dictionary, I need to identify which blocks can form the circular opening when arranged in a square pattern. Each block needs to have a quarter-circular cutout that, when combined with three other identical blocks (each rotated properly), will form a complete circular opening.\n\nThe blocks I need are block #1 and block #2, which appear to be identical red blocks with semicircular cutouts. When arranged properly, these blocks will form the circular frame seen in the target image.\n\n## Required Blocks:\n- 2× Block #1\n- 2× Block #2\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nTo construct the target structure, I'll need to place the blocks in a specific order to form the square with a circular hole:\n\n```\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 2 \nStep3: Move block with index 1\nStep4: Move block with index 2\n```\n\nThis arrangement will position the blocks so that the semicircular cutouts align perfectly to form the complete circular opening seen in the target image. Each block contributes a quarter of the circular opening, and when arranged in the correct orientation, they create the complete structure.",

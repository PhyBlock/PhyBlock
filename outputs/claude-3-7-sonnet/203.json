I'll use #11 as the closest match.\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 11\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 7\n   Step9: Move block with index 6\n   Step10: Move block with index 4\n   Step11: Move block with index 7\n   Step12: Move block with index 11\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order first creates the house structure (steps 1-6) and then the tower structure (steps 7-12).",

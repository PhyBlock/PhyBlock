Red arch blocks (indexes 1, 2)\n2. Blue cube (index 7)\n3. Green cube (index 8)\n4. Yellow cubes (index 9)\n5. Orange triangular pieces (indexes 13, 14, 15, 16)\n6. Orange rectangular pieces (indexes 10, 11, 12)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 9\n   Step4: Move block with index 10\n   Step5: Move block with index 11\n   Step6: Move block with index 12\n   Step7: Move block with index 13\n   Step8: Move block with index 14\n   Step9: Move block with index 15\n   Step10: Move block with index 16\n   Step11: Move block with index 7\n   Step12: Move block with index 8\n   Step13: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly sequence follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the base structure (arches and cubes), then adding the middle components, followed by the roof triangular pieces, and finally the top cube blocks. The secondary smaller structure is assembled last.",

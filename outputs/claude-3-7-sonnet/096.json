Block #3 - Red U-shaped block (with the U facing upward)\n2. Block #6 - Blue cube\n3. Block #7 - Yellow cube\n4. Block #8 - Green rectangular block (horizontal orientation)\n5. Block #13 - Orange cylinder\n6. Block #15 - Orange triangular block\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 13\n   Step3: Move block with index 15\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the base (green rectangular block), then placing the main supporting cylinder, adding the triangular block and cubes in the middle layer, and finally placing the red U-shaped block on top of the cylinder.",

The structure has multiple layers and consists of various colored blocks.\n\n### Block Count and Layers:\n- Total blocks: Approximately 20 blocks\n- Layers: The structure has 3 main layers in height at various points\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\nThe structure can be divided into several sections:\n1. **Left Section (House/Tower)**: \n   - Base layer: Red block with circular tunnel, yellow square blocks on sides\n   - Middle layer: Orange triangular roof pieces, green square block on left\n   - Top layer: Blue square block with orange triangular roof\n\n2. **Middle Section**:\n   - Red block with circular tunnel\n   - Green rectangular block on top\n   - Yellow blocks at the base\n\n3. **Right Section**:\n   - Two blue cube blocks stacked on the green rectangular block\n\n## Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks (using their indices):\n\n1. Red tunnel blocks: #1, #2, #3 (the tunnel pieces)\n2. Blue cube blocks: #4 (used 3 times)\n3. Green cube: #5 (used once)\n4. Yellow cube: #6 (used 3 times)\n5. Green rectangular blocks: #7 and #9 (horizontal rectangles)\n6. Green vertical rectangle: #8 (used once)\n7. Yellow rectangular blocks: #10 and #12 (horizontal)\n8. Yellow vertical rectangle: #11 (used once)\n9. Orange triangular/roof pieces: #13, #14, #15, #16 (various angles)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6 (yellow cube - left base)\n   Step2: Move block with index 6 (yellow cube - right base)\n   Step3: Move block with index 6 (yellow cube - far right base)\n   Step4: Move block with index 2 (red tunnel piece - left)\n   Step5: Move block with index 3 (red tunnel piece - right)\n   Step6: Move block with index 5 (green cube - left tower)\n   Step7: Move block with index 7 (green horizontal rectangle - middle section)\n   Step8: Move block with index 10 (yellow horizontal rectangle - extended base)\n   Step9: Move block with index 12 (yellow horizontal rectangle - right side)\n   Step10: Move block with index 14 (orange cube block - tower base)\n   Step11: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular roof - left)\n   Step12: Move block with index 16 (orange triangular roof - right)\n   Step13: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular plate - left roof)\n   Step14: Move block with index 4 (blue cube - tower top)\n   Step15: Move block with index 4 (blue cube - first cargo block)\n   Step16: Move block with index 4 (blue cube - second cargo block)\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order builds the structure from bottom to top, starting with the base and working up to the roof and final pieces.",

Blue cube (index 3)\n2. Orange cylindrical blocks (indexes 8 and 9)\n3. Yellow semi-cylindrical block (index 10)\n4. Red arch block (index 1)\n5. Orange vertical cylinder (index 8)\n6. Orange triangular roof (index 16)\n7. Yellow vertical blocks (index 7)\n8. Yellow horizontal block (index 6)\n9. Green vertical block (index 4)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1 (Red arch block as base for right structure)\n   Step2: Move block with index 8 (Orange vertical cylinder on top of red arch)\n   Step3: Move block with index 16 (Orange triangular roof on top of orange cylinder)\n   Step4: Move block with index 7 (Yellow vertical block on right side of red arch)\n   Step5: Move block with index 7 (Yellow vertical block on left side of red arch)\n   Step6: Move block with index 4 (Green vertical block on far right)\n   Step7: Move block with index 9 (Orange horizontal cylinder as left wheel)\n   Step8: Move block with index 9 (Orange horizontal cylinder as right wheel)\n   Step9: Move block with index 10 (Yellow semi-cylindrical block on top of wheels)\n   Step10: Move block with index 3 (Blue cube on top of yellow semi-cylindrical block)\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order follows a bottom-up approach for both structures, starting with the right structure (house-like) and then building the left structure (vehicle-like).",

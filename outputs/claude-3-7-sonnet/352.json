Left Construction (Car-like object):\n   - 4 blocks total (2 orange cylinders, 1 yellow rectangular block, 1 blue cube)\n   - 2 layers (cylindrical wheels on bottom, yellow and blue blocks on top)\n\n2. Right Construction (Tower-like object):\n   - 8 blocks total (3 orange cylinders, 2 yellow rectangular blocks, 3 orange triangular roofs)\n   - 4 layers (cylindrical bases, cross-shaped yellow rectangles, cylindrical tower, triangular roof)\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n\n### Left Construction (Car-like):\n- Two orange horizontal cylinders form the base (wheels)\n- A horizontal yellow rectangular block is placed across the top of the cylinders\n- A blue cube sits on the left end of the yellow block\n\n### Right Construction (Tower-like):\n- Two orange vertical cylinders form the base/pillars\n- Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally in a cross formation on top of the cylinders\n- A tall orange vertical cylinder rises from the center where the yellow blocks intersect\n- Three orange triangular roof pieces are placed: one at the top of the tall cylinder and two on each end of one of the yellow blocks\n\n# Required Blocks from Dictionary\n\nBased on the analysis, I need the following blocks:\n\n1. Left Construction:\n   - 2× Orange horizontal cylinders (index 9)\n   - 1× Yellow horizontal rectangular block (index 5)\n   - 1× Blue cube (index 1)\n\n2. Right Construction:\n   - 2× Orange vertical cylinders (index 8)\n   - 2× Yellow horizontal rectangular blocks (index 5 or 6, they appear similar in orientation)\n   - 1× Orange vertical cylinder (index 8)\n   - 3× Orange triangular roof pieces (index 13, 14, or 16 - they all appear to be triangular roof pieces in similar orientations)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 8\n   Step7: Move block with index 5\n   Step8: Move block with index 6\n   Step9: Move block with index 8\n   Step10: Move block with index 13\n   Step11: Move block with index 13\n   Step12: Move block with index 13\n}\n```",

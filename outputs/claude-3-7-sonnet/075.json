Let me break down the structure in detail:\n\n## Count & Layers:\n- The structure has 7 blocks in total\n- There are 3 main layers:\n  - Bottom layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks (wheels)\n  - Middle layer: Two yellow rectangular blocks (base)\n  - Top layer: One red arch block (cabin) and one orange triangular block (roof)\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- Bottom layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks are placed horizontally, parallel to each other, forming the wheels of the vehicle\n- Middle layer: Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of the cylindrical wheels, forming a platform/base\n- Top layer: A red arch block (with a semicircular cutout) is placed on top of the yellow base, positioned toward the right side\n- An orange triangular block is positioned on top of the red arch block, forming a roof\n\n# Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Block #12 - Orange horizontal cylinder (right wheel)\n2. Block #13 - Orange horizontal cylinder (left wheel)\n3. Block #7 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (front base)\n4. Block #10 - Yellow horizontal rectangular block (rear base)\n5. Block #1 - Red arch block with semicircular cutout\n6. Block #15 - Orange triangular block (roof)\n\n# Assembly Order\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order starts with placing the wheels (bottom layer), then adding the base platform (middle layer), followed by the cabin and roof (top layer) to complete the vehicle structure.",

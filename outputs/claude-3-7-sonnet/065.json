Bottom layer: A red arch-shaped block with a semi-circular cutout in the front\n2. Top layer: Two cube blocks placed side by side\n   - A blue cube on the left side\n   - A yellow cube on the right side\n\nThe red arch block serves as the foundation, and the two colored cubes are placed on top of it, adjacent to each other.\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on the target image, I need to select these blocks:\n- Block #1: Red arch-shaped block with a semi-circular cutout (matches the bottom foundation block)\n- Block #9: Blue cube (matches the top-left blue cube)\n- Block #13: Yellow cube (matches the top-right yellow cube)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n\nThe assembly begins with placing the red arch block as the foundation, followed by positioning the blue cube on the left side of the top layer, and finally placing the yellow cube on the right side of the top layer to complete the structure.",

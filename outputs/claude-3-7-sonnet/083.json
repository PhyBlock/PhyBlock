It has the following components:\n\n- **Total Number of Blocks**: 5 blocks\n- **Number of Layers**: 3 layers\n- **Spatial Relationships**:\n  - Bottom layer (1st layer): A yellow cube-shaped block on the left and a red cube-shaped block on the right\n  - Middle layer (2nd layer): A green rectangular block placed horizontally across the top of both bottom blocks\n  - Top layer (3rd layer): Two triangular orange blocks forming a roof shape\n\n## Required Blocks from the Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n1. Block #3: Yellow cube (for bottom left)\n2. Block #2: Red cube (for bottom right)\n3. Block #4: Green horizontal rectangular block (for middle layer)\n4. Block #16: Orange triangular roof piece (right side of roof)\n5. Block #13: Orange triangular roof piece (left side of roof)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 3\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 4\n   Step4: Move block with index 13\n   Step5: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from the bottom up, starting with the foundation blocks, then placing the middle layer, and finally adding the roof components.",

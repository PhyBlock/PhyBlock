Two orange horizontal cylinders (identical orientation)\n2. One yellow horizontal rectangular block\n3. One blue cube\n\nFrom the block dictionary, I identify these as:\n- Blue cube: Block index 1\n- Yellow horizontal rectangular block: Block index 7\n- Orange horizontal cylinders: Block index 14 (need two of these)\n\n## Assembly Order\nFollowing the logical building sequence from bottom to top:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 14\n   Step2: Move block with index 14\n   Step3: Move block with index 7\n   Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly sequence places the two cylinders first as the base, then adds the rectangular platform, and finally places the blue cube on top to complete the structure.",

Left Structure:\n   - Has a house-like design with a red archway topped with an orange triangular roof\n   - Green cube blocks on the sides\n   - Orange cylindrical blocks\n   - Orange triangular blocks\n\n2. Right Structure:\n   - A red rectangular tunnel/doorway design with holes on both sides\n   - Green cube in the middle\n   - Blue cube on one side\n\nTotal block count: 13 blocks\nLayers: The structure has 1-3 layers depending on the section\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The left structure has green rectangular blocks (#8) standing vertically on both sides\n- Two orange cylindrical blocks (#10) stand vertically in front of and behind the red archway\n- A red arch block (#1) sits on top of these elements\n- An orange triangular block (#14) sits on top of the red arch as a roof\n- Orange triangular wedges (#11, #15) are positioned at the base of the structure\n\n- The right structure has a red arch block (#1) at the top\n- Another red arch block (#3) at the bottom\n- A green cube (#5) in the middle right side\n- A blue cube (#4) on the left side\n\n# Block Selection from Dictionary\n\nBased on my analysis, the following blocks from the dictionary are required:\n\n1. Red arch block (index #1) - used twice (top and one side of right structure)\n2. Red curved block (index #2) - not visible in the main structure\n3. Red vertical arch block (index #3) - used once (bottom of right structure)\n4. Blue cube (index #4) - used once (left side of right structure)\n5. Green cube (index #5) - used three times (sides of left structure and middle of right structure)\n6. Yellow cube (index #6) - not used\n7. Green horizontal rectangular block (index #7) - not used\n8. Green vertical rectangular block (index #8) - used twice (sides of left structure)\n9. Green horizontal rectangular block (index #9) - not used\n10. Orange cylinder (index #10) - used twice (vertical columns in left structure)\n11. Orange triangular wedge (index #11) - used once (right side of left structure)\n12. Orange cube (index #12) - not used\n13. Orange triangular wedge (index #13) - not used\n14. Orange triangular wedge (index #14) - used once (roof of left structure)\n15. Orange triangular wedge (index #15) - used once (left side of left structure)\n16. Orange triangular wedge (index #16) - not used\n\n# Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5 (Green cube for bottom left side of structure)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (Green vertical rectangle for left side)\n    Step3: Move block with index 10 (Orange cylinder for left front)\n    Step4: Move block with index 10 (Orange cylinder for left back)\n    Step5: Move block with index 8 (Green vertical rectangle for right side)\n    Step6: Move block with index 15 (Orange triangular wedge for left side)\n    Step7: Move block with index 11 (Orange triangular wedge for right side)\n    Step8: Move block with index 1 (Red arch block for top of left structure)\n    Step9: Move block with index 14 (Orange triangular wedge for roof)\n    Step10: Move block with index 3 (Red vertical arch for bottom of right structure)\n    Step11: Move block with index 5 (Green cube for middle of right structure)\n    Step12: Move block with index 4 (Blue cube for left side of right structure)\n    Step13: Move block with index 1 (Red arch block for top of right structure)\n}\n```",

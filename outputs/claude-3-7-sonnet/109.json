For the bottom layer:\n   - Block 6: Blue cube (right side of bottom layer)\n   - Block 7: Green cube (left side of bottom layer)\n   - Block 13: Yellow rounded block with two half-cylinder shapes (front of bottom layer)\n\n2. For the middle layer:\n   - Block 9: Yellow rectangular block positioned horizontally (middle layer)\n\n3. For the top layer:\n   - Block 2: Red U-shaped block with concave side up (top layer)\n\n## Assembly Order\n\nThe logical assembly sequence would be to build from the bottom up:\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7\n   Step2: Move block with index 6\n   Step3: Move block with index 13\n   Step4: Move block with index 9\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence first places the two cube blocks (green and blue) side by side, then places the yellow rounded piece in front of them to complete the base. Next, it adds the yellow rectangular block as the middle layer spanning the cubes, and finally places the red U-shaped block on top.",

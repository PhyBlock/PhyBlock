Red cube (index 4) - for the left base block\n2. Orange cube (index 3) - for the right base block\n3. Green horizontal rectangular block (index 6) - for the middle layer\n4. Orange triangular/roof block (index 12) - for the top layer\n\n## Assembly Order\n\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 4\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n\nThis assembly order follows a bottom-to-top construction approach, starting with the base blocks, then adding the middle horizontal block, and finally placing the triangular roof piece on top.",

A small train-like structure on the left with:\n   - Blue cube on top\n   - Yellow body pieces\n   - Orange cylindrical wheels\n\n2. A building-like structure on the right with:\n   - Orange triangular roof\n   - Orange cylindrical tower\n   - Red base with arches\n   - Yellow side pieces\n   - Green rectangular block\n\nLet me break down the assembly order for both structures.\n\nFor the train structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9 (orange horizontal cylinder for front wheel)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (orange horizontal cylinder for back wheel)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal rectangular block for body)\n    Step4: Move block with index 10 (yellow semi-circular block for top)\n    Step5: Move block with index 3 (blue cube for cabin)\n}\n\nFor the building structure:\n{\n    Step6: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step7: Move block with index 8 (orange vertical cylinder for tower)\n    Step8: Move block with index 7 (yellow vertical block for left side)\n    Step9: Move block with index 7 (yellow vertical block for right side)\n    Step10: Move block with index 4 (green vertical block)\n    Step11: Move block with index 16 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the base components and building upward. The structure uses a total of 11 blocks, with some block indices being used multiple times (like index 7 and 9).",

A vertical stack on the left made of red, green, and yellow blocks with holes/arches\n2. A taller structure on the right consisting of orange cylindrical pillars with a red and yellow top section\n\nBlock Count and Layers:\nLeft Structure (bottom to top):\n- Red block with hole\n- Green block\n- Yellow block with curved top\n- Green block\n- Red block with hole\n\nRight Structure:\n- Two orange cylindrical pillars\n- Yellow horizontal block connecting them\n- Red block with hole on top\n- Orange triangular roof piece\n\nLet me provide the step-by-step assembly instructions:\n\nFor the Left Stack:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3 (bottom red block with hole)\n    Step2: Move block with index 4 (green rectangular block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 11 (yellow curved block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 4 (green rectangular block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 3 (top red block with hole)\n}\n\nFor the Right Structure:\n{\n    Step6: Move block with index 10 (first orange cylinder)\n    Step7: Move block with index 10 (second orange cylinder)\n    Step8: Move block with index 7 (yellow horizontal connector)\n    Step9: Move block with index 1 (red block with hole)\n    Step10: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe blocks have been carefully selected to match both shape and orientation as shown in the dictionary image, with no rotations applied.",

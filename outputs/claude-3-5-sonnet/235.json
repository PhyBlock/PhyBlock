      "text": "Let me analyze the target structure and provide a solution.\n\nAnalysis of Main Target Image:\n- The target shows two structures: a simple base structure (left) and a complete structure (right) with an additional yellow block and red block on top\n- The base structure consists of:\n  * Two yellow semicircular blocks at the bottom\n  * One green cubic block and one blue cubic block on top of the yellow blocks\n- The complete structure adds:\n  * One horizontal yellow rectangular block across the top of the green and blue blocks\n  * One red U-shaped block sitting on top of the yellow rectangular block\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary and assembly order:\n\nFor the complete structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 13\nStep2: Move block with index 14\nStep3: Move block with index 7\nStep4: Move block with index 6\nStep5: Move block with index 11\nStep6: Move block with index 3\n}\n\nExplanation:\n1. Place first yellow semicircular block (13)\n2. Place second yellow semicircular block (14)\n3. Place green cubic block (7)\n4. Place blue cubic block (6)\n5. Place yellow rectangular block (11) horizontally across the top\n6. Place red U-shaped block (3) on top\n\nThis assembly sequence will create the complete structure as shown in the target image, with exact matching of block shapes, colors, and orientations.",

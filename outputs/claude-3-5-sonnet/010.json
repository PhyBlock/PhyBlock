Base layer: A blue T-shaped structure made of three cube blocks\n  2. Upper layer: Four orange pieces (one vertical cylinder and three angled roof-like pieces)\n- Total blocks used: 7 blocks (3 blue cubes + 4 orange pieces)\n\nBlock Selection from Dictionary:\n- For blue base: Need 3x blue cubes (using block #2)\n- For center: Need 1x orange vertical cylinder (using block #4)\n- For the angled roof pieces: Need 3x identical angled pieces (using block #11)\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 [Center blue cube]\n    Step2: Move block with index 2 [Left blue cube]\n    Step3: Move block with index 2 [Right blue cube]\n    Step4: Move block with index 4 [Center vertical orange cylinder]\n    Step5: Move block with index 11 [Front angled roof piece]\n    Step6: Move block with index 11 [Left angled roof piece]\n    Step7: Move block with index 11 [Right angled roof piece]\n}\n\nThe structure is built from bottom to top, starting with the blue T-shaped base, then adding the central orange cylinder, and finally placing the three angled roof pieces to complete the symmetric design.",

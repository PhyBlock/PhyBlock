Bottom: Yellow rectangular base with two orange cylinders\n  2. Middle: Yellow rectangular platform\n  3. Top: Red house structure with an orange triangular roof\n\nComponents needed from dictionary:\n- 2 yellow rectangular blocks (indices 5, 7) for base and middle platform\n- 2 orange cylindrical pillars (indices 8, 9)\n- 1 red arch piece for house body (index 1)\n- 1 orange triangular roof piece (index 12)\n\nAssembly Order (from bottom to top):\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 7 (bottom yellow base)\nStep2: Move block with index 8 (first orange cylinder)\nStep3: Move block with index 9 (second orange cylinder)\nStep4: Move block with index 5 (middle yellow platform)\nStep5: Move block with index 1 (red house body)\nStep6: Move block with index 12 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe assembly order ensures stability by building from the ground up, with the supporting base first, followed by the pillars, then the middle platform, and finally the house structure with its roof.",

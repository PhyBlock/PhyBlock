A simpler vehicle-like structure (left):\n- Made of yellow blocks forming a base with wheels\n- Has an orange triangular roof\n- 2 layers high\n\n2. A taller tower-like structure (right):\n- Red base with circular opening\n- Two green vertical pillars\n- Yellow horizontal supports\n- Orange triangular roof\n- 4 layers high\n\nLet me provide assembly instructions for both structures:\n\nFor the Vehicle Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9 (yellow horizontal base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 12 (yellow curved wheel) \n    Step3: Move block with index 12 (yellow curved wheel)\n    Step4: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal top)\n    Step5: Move block with index 15 (orange triangle roof)\n}\n\nFor the Tower Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (red arch piece left)\n    Step3: Move block with index 2 (red arch piece right)\n    Step4: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal middle support)\n    Step5: Move block with index 7 (green vertical pillar)\n    Step6: Move block with index 8 (green vertical pillar)\n    Step7: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal top)\n    Step8: Move block with index 15 (orange triangle roof)\n}\n\nThe blocks have been selected to match exact orientations as shown in the dictionary, and the assembly order follows a bottom-to-top approach for stability.",

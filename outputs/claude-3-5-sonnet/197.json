Left Structure (Yellow with Orange top):\n- Base: Two yellow semicircular blocks (like supports)\n- Middle: One yellow rectangular block\n- Top: One orange triangular block\n\n2. Right Structure (Red/Orange):\n- Base: Three connected red arch blocks forming a bridge-like structure\n- Top: Three orange triangular/wedge blocks forming a roof\n\nNow, I'll provide the step-by-step assembly instructions using blocks from the dictionary:\n\nFor the Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n}\n\nFor the Right Structure:\n{\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to match both shape and orientation exactly as shown in the dictionary. The left structure uses yellow cylindrical supports (7), a yellow rectangular block (4), and an orange triangular top (13). The right structure uses three red arch pieces (1,2,3) and three identical orange triangular roof pieces (14).",

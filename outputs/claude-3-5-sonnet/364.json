Left Structure:\n- A red block with a circular hole, sandwiched between two yellow horizontal bars\n- Total of 3 layers\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- Built on two orange cylindrical blocks as base\n- Green rectangular block on top of the cylinders\n- Red cubic block above the green block\n- Blue cubic block at the top\n- Total of 4 layers\n\nFrom the Block Dictionary, I'll identify the needed blocks and provide the assembly sequence:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 14 (bottom yellow bar)\nStep2: Move block with index 3 (red block with hole)\nStep3: Move block with index 15 (top yellow bar)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\nStep4: Move block with index 16 (orange cylinder)\nStep5: Move block with index 16 (second orange cylinder)\nStep6: Move block with index 11 (green rectangular block)\nStep7: Move block with index 9 (red cubic block)\nStep8: Move block with index 6 (blue cubic block)\n}\n\nThe blocks are used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation, and the assembly sequence follows a bottom-to-top approach for stability.",

Red block with semicircle cutout\n  2. Green rectangular block\n  3. Two blocks side by side: blue cube and yellow cube\n  4. Green rectangular block\n  5. Red block with semicircle cutout\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary with indices:\n- Red semicircle blocks: #1 (top block) and #1 rotated 180Â° (bottom block)\n- Green rectangular blocks: #12 or #16 (they appear identical)\n- Blue cube: #8\n- Yellow cube: #11\n\nAssembly order from bottom to top:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n}\n\nNote: For Step 6, the block #1 needs to be oriented upright as shown in the target image, while for Step 1 it needs to be inverted.",

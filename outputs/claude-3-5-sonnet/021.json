Here's the step-by-step sequence:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nExplanation of block choices:\n- Block 1 (used twice): Red arch blocks for the base\n- Block 10: Yellow horizontal connecting block\n- Block 6 (used twice): Green cube blocks\n- Block 8: Blue rectangular block\n- Block 14: Orange triangular roof piece\n\nEach block matches exactly in shape, color, and orientation as shown in the dictionary without requiring any rotation.",

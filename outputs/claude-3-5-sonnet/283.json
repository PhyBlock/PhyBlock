Bottom layer: Red arched bridge + orange cylindrical supports\n2. Middle layer: Green blocks + yellow platform blocks\n3. Top layer: Orange vertical cylinder + yellow dome\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n    Step11: Move block with index 9\n    Step12: Move block with index 11\n    Step13: Move block with index 12\n    Step14: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence first creates the red bridge base, then adds the green blocks on top, followed by the yellow platform with its orange support pillars, and finally the orange tower with its yellow dome top.",

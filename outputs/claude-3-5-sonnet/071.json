Bottom layer: 4 red arch blocks (2 sets of 2)\n2. Second layer: 2 yellow horizontal connectors + 2 red arch blocks\n3. Third layer: 2 green vertical pillars + 1 yellow horizontal connector\n4. Top layer: 1 yellow horizontal block + 1 orange triangular block\n\nAssembly order from the block dictionary:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 \nStep2: Move block with index 1\nStep3: Move block with index 3\nStep4: Move block with index 3\nStep5: Move block with index 9\nStep6: Move block with index 9\nStep7: Move block with index 1\nStep8: Move block with index 1\nStep9: Move block with index 11\nStep10: Move block with index 6\nStep11: Move block with index 6\nStep12: Move block with index 8\nStep13: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe blocks are matched exactly as shown in the dictionary, with proper orientations and no rotations needed. This sequence will create the exact structure shown in the target image.",

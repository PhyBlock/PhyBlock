Base: Green horizontal block\n2. Orange cylindrical pillar\n3. Frame made of:\n   - Two vertical green blocks as sides\n   - Two horizontal yellow blocks at top and bottom\n   - Small orange triangular block inside\n4. Green block\n5. Blue block at the very top\n\nAssembly sequence using blocks from dictionary:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4    // Green horizontal base\n    Step2: Move block with index 9    // Orange vertical cylinder\n    Step3: Move block with index 5    // Left green vertical frame piece\n    Step4: Move block with index 6    // Right green vertical frame piece\n    Step5: Move block with index 7    // Bottom yellow horizontal frame piece\n    Step6: Move block with index 8    // Top yellow horizontal frame piece\n    Step7: Move block with index 12   // Orange triangle piece inside frame\n    Step8: Move block with index 4    // Green block above frame\n    Step9: Move block with index 1    // Blue block at top\n}\n\nEach block is selected to match the exact orientation as shown in the dictionary, with no rotation needed. The structure is built from bottom to top in a stable manner.",

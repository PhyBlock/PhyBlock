Left Structure (looks like a castle or gate):\n- Made of green rectangular blocks and orange triangular/cylindrical pieces\n- Has 4 components arranged symmetrically:\n  * Two vertical green blocks on the sides\n  * A central orange cylindrical piece\n  * Orange triangular pieces as slopes on both sides\n\n2. Right Structure (tower stack):\n- A vertical stack of 6 blocks\n- From bottom to top:\n  * Yellow cube at base\n  * Orange rectangular block\n  * Green horizontal block\n  * Two blue cubes\n  * Red cube on top\n\nLet me provide the assembly instructions for both structures:\n\nLeft Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7 (vertical green block - left side)\n    Step2: Move block with index 7 (vertical green block - right side)\n    Step3: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder - center)\n    Step4: Move block with index 13 (orange triangle - left side)\n    Step5: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle - right side)\n}\n\nRight Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5 (yellow cube - base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 3 (orange cube)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (horizontal green block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (blue cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (another blue cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 4 (red cube - top)\n}\n\nEach step builds from bottom to top, ensuring stability of the structures. The blocks are used exactly as they appear in the dictionary without any rotation.",

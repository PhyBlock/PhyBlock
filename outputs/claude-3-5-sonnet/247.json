Left Structure:\n- 2 orange cylindrical pillars\n- 1 yellow horizontal beam connecting them\n- 1 yellow half-cylinder cap on top\n- 3 layers in total\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- 2 orange cylindrical pillars\n- 2 yellow horizontal beams (top and bottom)\n- House-like structure on top made of:\n  * 2 blue cubic blocks\n  * 1 red cubic block in center\n  * 2 orange triangular roof pieces\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 3\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to exactly match the orientations shown in the dictionary image without any rotation. The structures are built from bottom to top, ensuring stability during construction.",

Left Structure (Tower):\n- 4 layers high \n- Base: 2 yellow rectangular blocks supporting 2 orange cylinders\n- Middle: 2 blue cubes on a yellow platform\n- Top: Red arch block with orange triangular roof\n\n2. Right Structure (Bridge):\n- Base: 3 red arch blocks forming a bridge\n- Middle: 2 yellow cylindrical blocks on top of arches\n- Back: 2 tall yellow rectangular blocks\n- Sides: 2 green rectangular blocks\n\nAssembly Instructions:\nFor Left Structure (Tower):\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nFor Right Structure (Bridge):\n{\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 2\n    Step12: Move block with index 1\n    Step13: Move block with index 10\n    Step14: Move block with index 11\n    Step15: Move block with index 8\n    Step16: Move block with index 8\n    Step17: Move block with index 6\n    Step18: Move block with index 6\n}\n\nThe blocks are used according to their exact orientation as shown in the dictionary, and some blocks (like #1 for arches and #7 for platforms) are used multiple times to complete the structures.",

Left Structure (Red Arch Building):\n- 3 layers total\n- Base: 2 red arch blocks\n- Middle: 1 yellow rectangular block\n- Top: Red house-like structure with orange roof\n- Total blocks: 4 main pieces\n\n2. Right Structure (Green Tower):\n- Green rectangular tower with orange roof pieces\n- 2 green blocks stacked vertically\n- 3 orange triangular roof pieces arranged around the top\n- Total blocks: 5 pieces\n\nLet me provide the assembly instructions for both structures:\n\nLeft Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 2\nStep3: Move block with index 10\nStep4: Move block with index 12\n}\n\nRight Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 7\nStep2: Move block with index 7\nStep3: Move block with index 14\nStep4: Move block with index 15\nStep5: Move block with index 13\n}\n\nThe blocks are matched exactly as shown in the dictionary, using their proper orientation and colors. The yellow rectangular block (index 10) serves as a bridge between the red arches in the left structure, while the green blocks (index 7) are stacked vertically for the right structure's tower. The orange triangular pieces (indices 13, 14, 15) form the roof elements of the right structure.",

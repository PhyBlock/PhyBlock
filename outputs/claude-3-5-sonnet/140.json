Red arch/bridge piece (base)\n  2. Green rectangular block\n  3. Yellow horizontal block with orange triangular pieces on top\n  4. Orange triangular/sloped pieces forming a roof-like structure\n\nBlock Count: 5-6 pieces total\nSpatial Arrangement:\n- Base: Red arch piece\n- Middle: Green vertical block placed on top of the red arch\n- Top section: Yellow horizontal block with orange triangular pieces arranged to form a roof\n\nRequired Blocks from Dictionary (matching exact orientations):\n- Red arch: Block #1\n- Green vertical block: Block #6\n- Yellow horizontal block: Block #8\n- Orange triangular pieces: Block #13 and Block #14\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1\n  Step2: Move block with index 6\n  Step3: Move block with index 8\n  Step4: Move block with index 13\n  Step5: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence builds from bottom to top, ensuring stability of the structure. Each block is selected to match the exact orientation shown in the target image, with no rotation needed from how they appear in the dictionary.",

A red arch base\n  2. A blue cubic block above the arch\n  3. A yellow cylindrical block on top of the red base\n  4. An orange triangular roof piece\n\nLayers:\n- Ground layer: Red arch\n- Middle layer: Blue cube and yellow cylinder\n- Top layer: Orange triangular roof\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\nThe structure can be built using the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 5 (blue cube)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (yellow cylinder)\n    Step4: Move block with index 12 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe assembly starts from the bottom up, with the arch as the foundation, followed by the blue cube and yellow cylinder on the second layer, and finally the triangular roof piece on top. Each block matches exactly in color, shape, and orientation as shown in the block dictionary without requiring any rotation.",

Base layer: Yellow and red blocks with arches\n2. Middle layer: Green platform with blue cubes\n3. Top layer: Orange roof pieces with blue and green blocks\n\nBlock count by color:\n- Red: Arch pieces\n- Orange: Roof/triangular pieces\n- Yellow: Base support blocks\n- Green: Platform and square pieces\n- Blue: Cubic blocks\n\nAssembly Order (from bottom up):\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 6 \nStep2: Move block with index 12\nStep3: Move block with index 6\nStep4: Move block with index 2\nStep5: Move block with index 3\nStep6: Move block with index 10\nStep7: Move block with index 11\nStep8: Move block with index 7\nStep9: Move block with index 4\nStep10: Move block with index 4\nStep11: Move block with index 5\nStep12: Move block with index 15\nStep13: Move block with index 16\nStep14: Move block with index 13\nStep15: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the base yellow blocks, adds the arch components, builds up the green platform, places the blue cubes, and finally adds the orange roof pieces to complete the structure.",

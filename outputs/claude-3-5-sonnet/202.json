A small structure (left) consisting of:\n- Orange cylindrical and triangular pieces on top\n- Yellow rectangular base below the orange pieces\n- Green rectangular block\n- Red arch piece at the bottom\n\n2. A larger structure (right) consisting of:\n- A row of green rectangular blocks standing vertically\n- A long red base with two arches\n\nBlock Count and Layers:\nSmall structure: 5-6 blocks, 4 layers\nLarge structure: 6-7 blocks, 2 layers\n\nRequired blocks and assembly order:\n\nFor the left structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 3 (red arch piece)\nStep2: Move block with index 6 (green rectangular block)\nStep3: Move block with index 9 (yellow rectangular block)\nStep4: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular piece)\nStep5: Move block with index 11 (orange cylindrical piece)\n}\n\nFor the right structure:\n{\nStep6: Move block with index 1 (red arch piece)\nStep7: Move block with index 2 (red arch piece)\nStep8: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block)\nStep9: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block)\nStep10: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block)\nStep11: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block)\nStep12: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block)\n}\n\nNote: The green blocks in the right structure appear to be identical pieces (index 8) repeated multiple times to create the vertical wall effect.",

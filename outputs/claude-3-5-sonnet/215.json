Left Structure:\n- A cross-shaped base made of blue blocks with orange triangular pieces on the edges\n- A central orange cylinder with an orange triangular roof\n- 2 layers in total\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- Ground layer: Yellow blocks on sides, red tunnel block in center\n- Middle layer: Blue and green blocks\n- Top layer: Orange triangular roof pieces\n- 3 layers in total\n\nLet me provide the assembly instructions for both structures:\n\nLeft Structure Assembly:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 5\nStep2: Move block with index 8\nStep3: Move block with index 9\nStep4: Move block with index 8\nStep5: Move block with index 13\nStep6: Move block with index 14\nStep7: Move block with index 15\nStep8: Move block with index 16\nStep9: Move block with index 10\nStep10: Move block with index 12\n}\n\nRight Structure Assembly:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 7\nStep2: Move block with index 1\nStep3: Move block with index 7\nStep4: Move block with index 8\nStep5: Move block with index 6\nStep6: Move block with index 13\nStep7: Move block with index 14\nStep8: Move block with index 15\nStep9: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence is designed to build from bottom to top, ensuring stability of the structures. The blocks are selected to match exactly the orientations shown in the dictionary image, without any rotation.",

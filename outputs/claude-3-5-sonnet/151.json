Left Structure:\n- A castle-like structure with 3 layers\n- Red arched blocks at the base\n- Yellow rectangular blocks in the middle\n- Red blocks with an orange triangular roof on top\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- A flat arrangement\n- Orange triangular pieces on the outside\n- Blue blocks forming a cross pattern\n- Green block in the center\n\nLet me break down the assembly for each structure:\n\nFor the Left Structure (from bottom to top):\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 1\nStep3: Move block with index 8\nStep4: Move block with index 8\nStep5: Move block with index 1\nStep6: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nFor the Right Structure (working from center outward):\n{\nStep7: Move block with index 2\nStep8: Move block with index 6\nStep9: Move block with index 6\nStep10: Move block with index 6\nStep11: Move block with index 6\nStep12: Move block with index 14\nStep13: Move block with index 14\nStep14: Move block with index 14\nStep15: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe structures use the following blocks from the dictionary:\n- Block 1: Red arch\n- Block 2: Green cube\n- Block 6: Blue cube\n- Block 8: Yellow long block\n- Block 14: Orange triangular piece\n\nThe blocks are used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation, and some blocks (like the arches and triangular pieces) are used multiple times to create the complete structures.",

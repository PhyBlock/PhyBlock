Front section with red arches, yellow semicylinders on top, yellow vertical blocks, and green blocks\n  2. Back section (wagon) with orange cylinders as wheels, green blocks, and an orange triangular piece\n\nTotal blocks needed:\n- 2 red arch pieces\n- 2 yellow semicylinders\n- 2 yellow vertical blocks\n- 3 green rectangular blocks\n- 2 orange cylinders\n- 1 orange triangular piece\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder - left wheel of wagon)\nStep2: Move block with index 12 (orange cylinder - right wheel of wagon)\nStep3: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular block - wagon base)\nStep4: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle - wagon end piece)\nStep5: Move block with index 1 (red arch - left side)\nStep6: Move block with index 1 (red arch - right side)\nStep7: Move block with index 13 (yellow semicylinder - left top)\nStep8: Move block with index 13 (yellow semicylinder - right top)\nStep9: Move block with index 9 (yellow vertical block - left chimney)\nStep10: Move block with index 9 (yellow vertical block - right chimney)\nStep11: Move block with index 7 (green vertical block - left back)\nStep12: Move block with index 7 (green vertical block - right back)\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence builds from bottom to top and ensures stability of the structure.",

Place two vertical green blocks (index 3) on the left side\n3-4. Place two vertical green blocks (index 4) on the right side\n5. Place the vertical orange cylinder (index 6) in the center\n6-8. Add the three orange triangular blocks (indices 12, 14, and 15) as the roof elements\n\nThis will create the symmetrical structure shown in the target image, with the correct orientation of all blocks.",

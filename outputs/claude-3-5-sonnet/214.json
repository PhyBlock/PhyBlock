A castle-like structure with multiple layers\n2. A bridge-like structure made of cylindrical supports and a green block on top\n\nStructure 1 (Castle) breakdown:\n- Base layer: Two red arch blocks\n- Second layer: One yellow long block\n- Third layer: One blue cube and one green cube\n- Top layer: Red house-like structure with orange triangular roof\n\nStructure 2 (Bridge) breakdown:\n- Two orange cylindrical supports\n- One horizontal green rectangular block on top\n\nRequired blocks and assembly order:\n\nFor the Castle structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 (red arch block)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (red arch block)\nStep3: Move block with index 12 (yellow long block)\nStep4: Move block with index 6 (blue cube)\nStep5: Move block with index 7 (green cube)\nStep6: Move block with index 9 (red cube base)\nStep7: Move block with index 16 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nFor the Bridge structure:\n{\nStep8: Move block with index 13 (orange cylinder)\nStep9: Move block with index 13 (orange cylinder again)\nStep10: Move block with index 11 (green rectangular block)\n}\n\nTotal blocks used: 10 blocks (with the cylinder piece being used twice)",

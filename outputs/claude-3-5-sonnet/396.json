Left Structure:\n- A central blue cross-shaped base\n- Four orange triangular roof-like pieces around it\n- One orange column with a triangular roof on top\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- Two orange cylindrical columns\n- A yellow horizontal beam connecting them on top\n- Two orange triangular roof pieces on the yellow beam\n\nAnalysis of layers and block relationships:\n- Left structure has 2 layers (base + roofs)\n- Right structure has 2 layers (columns + beam with roofs)\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary and assembly order:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1 (center blue block)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (center blue block)\nStep3: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder)\nStep4: Move block with index 11 (orange triangular roof)\nStep5: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular piece)\nStep6: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular piece)\nStep7: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular piece)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\nStep8: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder)\nStep9: Move block with index 7 (orange cylinder again)\nStep10: Move block with index 3 (yellow horizontal beam)\nStep11: Move block with index 11 (orange triangular roof)\nStep12: Move block with index 11 (orange triangular roof again)\n}",

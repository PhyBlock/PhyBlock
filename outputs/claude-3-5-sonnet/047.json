Bottom: Yellow horizontal bar\n  2. Middle-bottom: Red block with circular hole\n  3. Middle-top: Two green vertical pillars with yellow horizontal bar\n  4. Top: Orange triangular roof piece with yellow horizontal bar\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary (bottom to top assembly):\n- Base: Horizontal yellow bar (Block 9)\n- Middle: Red arch piece (combination of Blocks 2 and 3)\n- Support pillars: Two green vertical blocks (Blocks 6 and 7)\n- Middle bar: Horizontal yellow bar (Block 10)\n- Top bar: Horizontal yellow bar (Block 9)\n- Roof: Orange triangular piece (Block 14)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThis will create the complete structure as shown in the target image, with proper placement and orientation of all blocks.",

Left Structure:\n- Has 3 components: a yellow curved base, a green vertical block in the middle, and an orange horizontal cylinder on top\n- 3 layers in height\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- Has 4 components: two orange vertical cylinders as supports, a yellow horizontal beam connecting them at the middle, and a yellow curved piece on top\n- 3 layers in height\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Steps:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 14 (yellow cylinder base)\nStep2: Move block with index 2 (green vertical block)\nStep3: Move block with index 11 (orange horizontal cylinder)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\nStep4: Move block with index 10 (orange vertical cylinder)\nStep5: Move block with index 10 (orange vertical cylinder)\nStep6: Move block with index 7 (yellow horizontal beam)\nStep7: Move block with index 12 (yellow curved top piece)\n}\n\nThis assembly order ensures stability by building from the bottom up. The blocks are selected to match exactly as they appear in the dictionary, with proper orientation and no rotation needed. The structure requires multiple uses of block #10 (orange cylinder) for the right structure's supports.",

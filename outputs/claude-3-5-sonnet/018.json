First two steps place the base arches\n2. Third step adds the yellow horizontal beam\n3. Fourth step adds the house structure with the arch\n4. Last two steps add the triangular roof pieces\n\nThe blocks must be placed exactly as shown in the dictionary without rotation, and this sequence will recreate the target structure precisely.",

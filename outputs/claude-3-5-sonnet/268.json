Left Structure:\n- 3 blocks total\n- 2 layers\n- Yellow cylindrical base\n- Green vertical block\n- Orange horizontal cylinder on top\n\n2. Right Structure:\n- 6 blocks total\n- 2 layers\n- Bottom layer: 2 red arch blocks forming a bridge\n- Top layer: 2 tall yellow blocks and 2 green blocks of different heights\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Instructions:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13 (yellow cylinder base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 5 (green vertical block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 11 (orange horizontal cylinder)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch block - left)\n    Step2: Move block with index 2 (red arch block - right)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (tall yellow block - left)\n    Step4: Move block with index 7 (tall yellow block - right)\n    Step5: Move block with index 5 (green vertical block - left)\n    Step6: Move block with index 5 (green vertical block - right)\n}\n\nTotal blocks used: 9 blocks (with some block types used multiple times)",

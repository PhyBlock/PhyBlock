Left structure: Red base with two semicircular indentations and a blue cube on top\n2. Right structure: Yellow base with two semicircular shapes and a green cube and blue cube on top\n\nLet me provide assembly instructions for both structures:\n\nFor the Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 \n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n}\n\nFor the Right Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n}\n\nThe key aspects of each structure:\n- Left structure uses a single red piece with two indentations (block 2) as the base and a blue cube (block 6) on top\n- Right structure uses two yellow semicircular pieces (blocks 11 and 12) as the base, with a green cube (block 7) and blue cube (block 6) stacked on top\n\nThe structures are independent of each other and demonstrate different arrangements of similar shaped blocks but with different colors.",

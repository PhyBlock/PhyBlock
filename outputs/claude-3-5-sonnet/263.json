Red House Structure:\n- Made of red blocks\n- Has an arched entrance\n- Has a triangular roof\n- Single structure, 1 layer\n\n2. Multicolored Rectangular Structure:\n- Contains yellow, green, red, and blue blocks\n- Has 3 vertical layers\n- Two horizontal yellow blocks at top and bottom\n- Two vertical green blocks on sides\n- Red and blue blocks in the center\n\nRequired blocks and assembly order:\n\nFor the Red House:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 13 (triangular roof piece)\n}\n\nFor the Multicolored Rectangle:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10 (yellow horizontal block for base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (green vertical block for left side)\n    Step3: Move block with index 8 (green vertical block for right side)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (red block for upper center)\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (blue block for lower center)\n    Step6: Move block with index 9 (yellow horizontal block for top)\n}\n\nThe structures are separate from each other on the surface. The multicolored structure is built from bottom to top, ensuring stability, while the red house is a simple two-piece construction.",

Bottom layer: Two arch pieces in red (appears to use blocks #1 and #2)\n2. Top layer: Three triangular pieces in orange (appears to use blocks #11, #11, and #12)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n}\n\nThe assembly builds from bottom to top:\n- First two steps create the base with the arches\n- Last three steps add the triangular roof pieces, with two identical pieces (11) and one slightly different piece (12) to complete the roof formation\n\nEach block is used exactly as shown in the dictionary without any rotation, matching both the shape and color of the target structure.",

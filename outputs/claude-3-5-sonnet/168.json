Base layer: Red arched blocks and orange cylindrical supports\n2. Middle layer: Yellow vertical blocks, green blocks\n3. Top layer: Orange tower with triangular roof\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary and assembly order:\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 1 (second arch piece)\nStep3: Move block with index 12 (place first cylinder)\nStep4: Move block with index 12 (place second cylinder)\nStep5: Move block with index 12 (place third cylinder)\nStep6: Move block with index 10 (yellow vertical block)\nStep7: Move block with index 11 (yellow vertical block)\nStep8: Move block with index 12 (orange tower cylinder)\nStep9: Move block with index 6 (green vertical block)\nStep10: Move block with index 4 (green horizontal block)\nStep11: Move block with index 4 (second green horizontal block)\nStep12: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence will create the structure shown in the target image, matching all colors and orientations exactly as shown in the block dictionary.",

Two green vertical rectangular blocks for legs\n2. One horizontal yellow rectangular block across the legs\n3. One red cube for lower torso\n4. One blue cube for upper torso\n5. One yellow curved/dome piece on top\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary and assembly order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7 (green vertical block for left leg)\n    Step2: Move block with index 7 (green vertical block for right leg)\n    Step3: Move block with index 11 (yellow horizontal block for seat)\n    Step4: Move block with index 4 (red cube for lower torso)\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (blue cube for upper torso)\n    Step6: Move block with index 13 (yellow curved piece for top)\n}\n\nEach block is selected to match the exact orientation as shown in the target image, without any rotation needed. The assembly sequence starts from the bottom and works up to create a stable structure.",

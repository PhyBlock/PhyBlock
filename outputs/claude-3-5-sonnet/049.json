Bottom green horizontal block (index 6)\n2. Left yellow vertical block (index 13)\n3. Right yellow vertical block (index 14)\n4. Red block in the middle (index 4)\n5. Top green horizontal block (index 6)\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly instructions in the required format:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence builds from bottom to top, creating a stable structure where each subsequent piece is supported by the previous pieces.",

Base: Horizontal green block\n2. Sides: Two vertical yellow blocks\n3. Top: Horizontal green block\n\nFor the right structure (from bottom to top):\n1. Base: Horizontal green block\n2. Middle section: Two vertical green blocks for sides, yellow blocks for horizontal supports\n3. Red cylinder in the center\n4. Red triangular pieces\n5. Top section: Yellow block, green block, and blue block\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3 (bottom green horizontal)\n    Step2: Move block with index 7 (yellow vertical)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (yellow vertical)\n    Step4: Move block with index 2 (green horizontal top)\n    Step5: Move block with index 3 (right structure base)\n    Step6: Move block with index 4 (right green vertical)\n    Step7: Move block with index 4 (right green vertical)\n    Step8: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal bottom)\n    Step9: Move block with index 9 (red cylinder)\n    Step10: Move block with index 14 (red triangle)\n    Step11: Move block with index 6 (yellow horizontal middle)\n    Step12: Move block with index 2 (green horizontal)\n    Step13: Move block with index 1 (blue block top)\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence will create both structures as shown in the target image, using the exact blocks from the dictionary in their given orientations.",

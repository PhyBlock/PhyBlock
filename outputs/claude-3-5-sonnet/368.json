Places the red arch blocks (index 1) to form the base\n2. Adds the red U-shaped block (index 3)\n3. Places the horizontal green blocks (index 6, 8) as platforms\n4. Adds the yellow vertical blocks (index 10) as chimneys\n5. Places the blue cubic blocks (index 4) as cargo\n6. Finishes with orange triangular blocks (index 12, 15) at the back",

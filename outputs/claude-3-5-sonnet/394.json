A more complex house-like structure on the right with multiple colors and levels\n\nLet me break down each structure:\n\nLeft Structure (Red Tunnel):\n- Made of red blocks\n- Uses 3 pieces forming a tunnel/bridge\n- Single layer construction\n\nRight Structure (House):\n- Multiple colors (red, yellow, green, blue, orange)\n- Base layer with tunnel opening\n- Middle layer with colored cubes\n- Top layer with orange triangular roof pieces\n- More complex assembly required\n\nAssembly Instructions for Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n}\n\nAssembly Instructions for Right Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7 (red cube for base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (yellow cube for base)\n    Step3: Move block with index 2 (red tunnel piece)\n    Step4: Move block with index 8 (yellow cube for base)\n    Step5: Move block with index 5 (green cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step7: Move block with index 12 (orange triangle roof)\n    Step8: Move block with index 12 (orange triangle roof)\n    Step9: Move block with index 12 (orange triangle roof)\n    Step10: Move block with index 12 (orange triangle roof)\n}\n\nNote: The orange triangular roof pieces (index 12) are used multiple times to create the complete roof structure.",

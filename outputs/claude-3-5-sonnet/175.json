A taller structure with cylinder supports and multiple layers\n2. A smaller house-like structure\n\nStructure Breakdown:\nTaller Structure:\n- Base: 3 orange cylinders (block #10)\n- Middle: 1 yellow horizontal rectangular block (block #9)\n- Top: Orange triangular blocks, blue cube, and yellow curved top piece\n\nSmaller Structure:\n- Bottom layer: 2 blue cubes (block #1) and 2 orange blocks\n- Middle layer: 1 green horizontal block (block #7)\n- Top layer: Orange triangular roof pieces\n\nAssembly Instructions:\nFor the taller structure:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 10\nStep2: Move block with index 10\nStep3: Move block with index 10\nStep4: Move block with index 9\nStep5: Move block with index 14\nStep6: Move block with index 1\nStep7: Move block with index 15\nStep8: Move block with index 11\n}\n\nFor the smaller structure:\n{\nStep9: Move block with index 1\nStep10: Move block with index 1\nStep11: Move block with index 3\nStep12: Move block with index 3\nStep13: Move block with index 7\nStep14: Move block with index 14\nStep15: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence ensures stability by building from bottom to top, starting with the support structure and then adding the decorative elements. Each block is used in its exact orientation as shown in the dictionary without any rotation.",

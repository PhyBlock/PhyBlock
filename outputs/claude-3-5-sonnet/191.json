A \"house-like\" structure on the left made of:\n   - Red arch base\n   - Green rectangular block on top\n   - Blue cube with orange triangular roof\n   - Orange cylindrical tower with triangular roof\n\n2. A \"vehicle-like\" structure on the right made of:\n   - Two orange horizontal cylinders as wheels\n   - Yellow rectangular platform\n   - Blue cube on top\n\nTotal blocks used: 9 blocks\nLayers: Maximum 3 layers in the house structure\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\nFor the house structure (left to right):\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 (green rectangle)\n    Step3: Move block with index 3 (blue cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 9 (orange cylinder)\n    Step5: Move block with index 13 (orange triangle roof)\n    Step6: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle roof)\n}\n\nFor the vehicle structure (left to right):\n{\n    Step7: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder)\n    Step8: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder again)\n    Step9: Move block with index 7 (yellow rectangle)\n    Step10: Move block with index 3 (blue cube)\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to match exactly as they appear in both orientation and color from the dictionary image, with no rotations needed.",

A red-green-red stacked structure with a hole through it\n2. A vehicle-like structure with blue cube on top of yellow blocks and orange cylindrical wheels\n\nAnalysis of components:\n- The first structure uses 3 blocks: two red pieces with curved cutouts and one green rectangular connector\n- The vehicle structure uses 4 blocks: a blue cube, a yellow rectangular base, and two orange cylinders\n\nRequired blocks from dictionary (with indices):\n- Red curved pieces: #4 and #5 (top and bottom of first structure)\n- Green rectangular piece: #8 (middle piece of first structure)\n- Blue cube: #6 (top of vehicle)\n- Yellow rectangular piece: #11 (base of vehicle)\n- Orange cylinders: #13 (used twice for wheels)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5 (bottom red piece)\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 (green connector)\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (top red piece)\n    Step4: Move block with index 13 (first orange cylinder wheel)\n    Step5: Move block with index 13 (second orange cylinder wheel)\n    Step6: Move block with index 11 (yellow base)\n    Step7: Move block with index 6 (blue cube)\n}",

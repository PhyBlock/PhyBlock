Bottom Layer:\nFirst, place the blue cubic block (index 3) as the foundation.\n\n2. Middle Layer:\nNext, place the red block with the semicircular cutout (index 2)\n\n3. Upper Layer:\nThen, add the horizontal green rectangular block (index 6)\n\n4. Top Layer:\nFinally, place the orange triangular roof piece (index 14)\n\nAssembly Instructions in required format:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 2\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThis sequence will create one of the structures shown in the target image. The second structure in the image is identical and would use the same blocks and assembly steps.",

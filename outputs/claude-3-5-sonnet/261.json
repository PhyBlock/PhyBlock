A traffic light-like structure consisting of:\n   - Green base\n   - Orange cylindrical middle\n   - Frame-like top with green sides, yellow top/bottom, and orange triangle inside\n\n2. A train-like structure consisting of:\n   - Red base with arches\n   - Blue, yellow, and orange blocks on top\n   - Green vertical piece at the back\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Instructions:\n\nFor Traffic Light Structure:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 7 (green horizontal base)\n   Step2: Move block with index 13 (orange cylinder)\n   Step3: Move block with index 8 (green vertical left side)\n   Step4: Move block with index 8 (green vertical right side)\n   Step5: Move block with index 12 (yellow horizontal top)\n   Step6: Move block with index 10 (yellow horizontal bottom)\n   Step7: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle)\n}\n\nFor Train Structure:\n{\n   Step8: Move block with index 1 (red arch piece left)\n   Step9: Move block with index 2 (red arch piece middle)\n   Step10: Move block with index 3 (red arch piece right)\n   Step11: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n   Step12: Move block with index 6 (yellow cube)\n   Step13: Move block with index 14 (yellow half-cylinder)\n   Step14: Move block with index 14 (yellow half-cylinder)\n   Step15: Move block with index 5 (orange cube)\n   Step16: Move block with index 9 (green vertical piece)\n}",

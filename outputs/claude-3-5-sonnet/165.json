A red arch structure with yellow beams on top (left side)\n2. A tall orange tower with yellow beams (right side)\n\nBlock count and layers:\n- Red blocks: 4 arch pieces\n- Yellow blocks: 4 horizontal beams\n- Orange blocks: 2 cylindrical pieces and 1 triangular top\n\nTotal blocks: 11 pieces\n\nSpatial relationships:\n- Left structure: Two red arches (2 pieces each) with 2 yellow beams on top\n- Right structure: Two orange cylinders stacked vertically with 2 yellow beams crossing them, topped with a triangular piece\n\nBlock selection from dictionary and assembly order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch piece)\n    Step2: Move block with index 2 (red arch piece)\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 (red arch piece)\n    Step4: Move block with index 2 (red arch piece)\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (yellow horizontal beam)\n    Step6: Move block with index 4 (yellow horizontal beam)\n    Step7: Move block with index 9 (orange cylinder)\n    Step8: Move block with index 9 (orange cylinder)\n    Step9: Move block with index 7 (yellow horizontal beam)\n    Step10: Move block with index 7 (yellow horizontal beam)\n    Step11: Move block with index 12 (orange triangle top)\n}\n\nEach block is selected to match the exact orientation shown in the target image, with no rotations needed beyond what's provided in the dictionary.",

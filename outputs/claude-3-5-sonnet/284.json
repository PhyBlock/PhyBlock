Left Section (Train-like structure):\n- Base layer: 2 red arch blocks\n- Middle layer: 2 yellow curved blocks, 1 orange cube, 1 green vertical block\n- Top layer: 1 blue cube, 2 yellow vertical blocks\n\n2. Right Section (Circle/tunnel structure):\n- Bottom: 1 red block with circular hole\n- Middle: 1 green horizontal block\n- Top: 1 red arch block\n\nTotal blocks used: 11 blocks in total\nTotal layers: 3 layers in the left section, 3 layers in the right section\n\nStep-by-step Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 5\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 11\n    Step10: Move block with index 4\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n    Step12: Move block with index 1\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence starts with the left train-like structure's base, builds up layer by layer, then creates the right tunnel structure. Each block is selected to match the exact orientation shown in the dictionary image.",

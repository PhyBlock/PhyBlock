Place first bottom red arch block\n2. Place second bottom red arch block\n3. Place first yellow connector\n4. Place second yellow connector\n5. Place first top red arch block\n6. Place second top red arch block\n\nThis will create the symmetrical H-shaped structure with arches as shown in the target image.",

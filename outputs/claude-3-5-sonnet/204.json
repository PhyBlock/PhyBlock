Left Structure (Small House):\n- Base: Red arch block\n- Middle: Green rectangular block\n- Top: Blue cube with orange triangular roof\n- Total: 4 blocks, 4 layers\n\n2. Right Structure (Tower with Extensions):\n- Two tall orange cylindrical pillars\n- Yellow rectangular blocks forming cross-shaped extensions\n- Orange triangular roofs on top\n- Total: 7 blocks (2 cylinders, 2 rectangles, 3 roofs), multiple layers\n\nBlock Selection and Assembly Order:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 7 (green rectangular block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 3 (blue cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder again)\n    Step7: Move block with index 8 (yellow rectangular block)\n    Step8: Move block with index 8 (yellow rectangular block again)\n    Step9: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof)\n    Step10: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular roof again)\n    Step11: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe blocks must be placed exactly as shown, with the yellow rectangles forming a cross pattern on top of the orange cylinders, and the triangular roofs positioned accordingly on each section.",

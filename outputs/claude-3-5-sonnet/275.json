      "text": "Let me analyze the target structure and provide a detailed solution.\n\nMain Target Image Analysis:\n- The image shows two structures: a tower-like structure on the left and a taller structure with attachments on the right\n- Left structure consists of multiple layers with a red arch base, yellow platforms, and colored blocks on top\n- Right structure has tall orange cylindrical columns with a red and yellow attachment featuring an arch\n\nLet me break down the assembly for each structure:\n\nLeft Structure (from bottom to top):\n1. Yellow base platform (block 8)\n2. Red arch piece (block 1)\n3. Yellow platform on top (block 8)\n4. Red cube (block 5)\n5. Blue cube (block 3)\n6. Green horizontal block (block 7)\n7. Orange triangular roof (block 15)\n\nRight Structure (from bottom to top):\n1. Two orange cylindrical pieces (block 11) stacked vertically\n2. Yellow platform (block 8)\n3. Red arch piece (block 2)\n4. Yellow curved piece (block 12)\n5. Orange triangular roof (block 15)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (base platform left structure)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 8 (top platform left structure)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (red cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 3 (blue cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 7 (green block)\n    Step7: Move block with index 15 (left roof)\n    Step8: Move block with index 11 (bottom cylinder right structure)\n    Step9: Move block with index 11 (top cylinder right structure)\n    Step10: Move block with index 8 (platform right structure)\n    Step11: Move block with index 2 (curved arch)\n    Step12: Move block with index 12 (yellow curved piece)\n    Step13: Move block with index 15 (right roof)\n}",

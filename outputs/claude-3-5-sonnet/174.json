Base layer: Red arch block\n2. Middle layer: Blue and green cubes\n3. Top layer: Orange triangular roof pieces\n\nFor the Right Structure:\n1. Base layer: Two red arch blocks with a red cube in between\n2. Second layer: Yellow horizontal block\n3. Third layer: Two green cubes\n4. Fourth layer: Red box with arch\n5. Top layer: Orange triangular roof pieces\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 //left base arch\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 //blue cube\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 //green cube\n    Step4: Move block with index 14 //left orange roof piece\n    Step5: Move block with index 15 //left orange roof piece\n    Step6: Move block with index 2 //right structure first arch\n    Step7: Move block with index 5 //middle red block\n    Step8: Move block with index 1 //right arch\n    Step9: Move block with index 8 //yellow horizontal block\n    Step10: Move block with index 7 //left green cube\n    Step11: Move block with index 7 //right green cube\n    Step12: Move block with index 1 //top red arch\n    Step13: Move block with index 14 //right roof piece\n    Step14: Move block with index 15 //right roof piece\n}",

Two orange cylindrical pieces as wheels/base (bottom layer)\n  2. A yellow rectangular piece as the body (middle layer)\n  3. A yellow half-cylindrical piece on top of the body\n  4. A blue cubic piece on top\n\nLayer count: 3 layers total\n\nFrom the Block Dictionary, we need:\n- 2× orange cylinders (block #9 and #10)\n- 1× yellow rectangular block in horizontal orientation (block #4)\n- 1× yellow half-cylinder (block #11)\n- 1× blue cube (block #1)\n\nAssembly Order (from bottom to top):\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence starts with the base (wheels), then adds the main body, followed by the curved top piece, and finally places the blue cube on top.",

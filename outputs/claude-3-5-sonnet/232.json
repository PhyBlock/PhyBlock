Horizontal green rectangular base\n2. Vertical orange cylinder\n3. Green assembly on top (formed by 3 blocks)\n\nRight Structure (from left to right):\n1. Vertical green blocks on each end\n2. Orange cylinders in the middle\n3. Orange triangular wedges on the sides\n4. Green block separating the cylinders\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n\nFor Left Structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n}\n\nFor Right Structure:\n{\n    Step6: Move block with index 3\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 11\n    Step11: Move block with index 11\n    Step12: Move block with index 14\n    Step13: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to match exactly as they appear in the dictionary, maintaining their orientation without any rotation. The assembly order follows a logical bottom-up and left-to-right sequence where appropriate.",

Place first orange cylinder (wheel) horizontally\n2. Place second orange cylinder (wheel) horizontally parallel to first\n3. Place green rectangular block horizontally across both cylinders\n4. Place red cube on green platform\n5. Place blue cube on top of red cube\n6. Place orange triangular roof piece on top of blue cube\n\nEach block is selected to match the exact orientation shown in the target image, without any rotation needed. The assembly builds from bottom to top in a stable manner.",

Base layer: Yellow rectangular blocks and orange cylinders\n2. Middle layer: Red and blue cubic blocks on the wagon, red arch structure\n3. Top layer: Orange triangular roof pieces\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal block for wagon base)\nStep2: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder) as left wagon wheel\nStep3: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder) as right wagon wheel\nStep4: Move block with index 4 (blue cube) for wagon cargo\nStep5: Move block with index 7 (red cube) for wagon cargo\nStep6: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal block) for main structure base left\nStep7: Move block with index 8 (yellow horizontal block) for main structure base right\nStep8: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder) for front support\nStep9: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder) for middle support\nStep10: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder) for rear support\nStep11: Move block with index 1 (red arch) for house structure\nStep12: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle) for left roof\nStep13: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle) for right roof\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence builds the structure from bottom to top, ensuring stability throughout the construction process.",

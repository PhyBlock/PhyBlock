A main table-like structure\n  2. A separate triangular-prismatic structure off to the side\n\nThe main structure consists of:\n- Base: 4 orange cylindrical pillars\n- Middle: 2 yellow rectangular blocks laid horizontally\n- Top: A vertical stack of 3 blocks (green cube, blue cube, yellow semi-circular top)\n\nThe separate structure is made of:\n- Orange triangular pieces\n- A blue rectangular face\n\nBlock count by layer:\n- Ground level: 4 pillars\n- Middle level: 2 rectangular blocks\n- Upper level: 3 blocks\n- Separate structure: Multiple triangular pieces\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5 (First orange pillar)\n    Step2: Move block with index 5 (Second orange pillar)\n    Step3: Move block with index 5 (Third orange pillar)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (Fourth orange pillar)\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (First yellow rectangular block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 4 (Second yellow rectangular block)\n    Step7: Move block with index 2 (Green cube)\n    Step8: Move block with index 1 (Blue cube)\n    Step9: Move block with index 6 (Yellow semi-circular top)\n    Step10: Move block with index 14 (First orange triangle)\n    Step11: Move block with index 14 (Second orange triangle)\n    Step12: Move block with index 1 (Blue rectangle portion)\n}\n\nThe structure can be completed by following these steps exactly as listed, using the blocks in their shown orientations from the dictionary image.",

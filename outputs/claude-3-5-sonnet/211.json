Left Structure (Tower):\n- 2 layers\n- Bottom: Green rectangular block (base)\n- Top: Orange cylindrical block with triangular roof\n- Simple vertical stack\n\n2. Right Structure (House with Arch):\n- Multiple layers and components\n- Base: Red arch piece with orange triangular sides\n- Middle: Green and blue cubic blocks\n- Top: Orange triangular roof piece\n\nLet me provide step-by-step assembly instructions for both structures:\n\nFor the Left Tower:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8 (green rectangular base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder)\n    Step3: Move block with index 12 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nFor the Right House with Arch:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch piece)\n    Step2: Move block with index 13 (orange triangular side)\n    Step3: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular side)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (green cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 12 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to match exact orientations as shown in the dictionary image, and the assembly order follows a bottom-up approach for stability.",

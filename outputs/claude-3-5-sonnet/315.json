Left structure: A red base with two semicircular indentations, with a blue cube on top\n2. Right structure: A vertical rectangular frame made of yellow pillars with green horizontal blocks at top and bottom, and a red triangular piece in the middle\n\nBlock Count and Layers:\nLeft structure: 2 layers (red base + blue cube)\nRight structure: 3 layers (bottom green, middle section with yellow pillars and red piece, top green)\n\nRequired blocks and assembly order:\n\nFor the left structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3 (red curved base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 7 (blue cube)\n}\n\nFor the right structure:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 14 (green horizontal block for base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 15 (yellow vertical block for left pillar)\n    Step3: Move block with index 15 (yellow vertical block for right pillar)\n    Step4: Move block with index 4 (red triangular piece)\n    Step5: Move block with index 11 (green horizontal block for top)\n}\n\nThe blocks are selected to exactly match the orientation and color shown in the target image, with no rotation needed.",

Base: A vertical green block\n2. Middle: A horizontal yellow block\n3. Main body: A red arch-shaped block\n4. Roof: An orange triangular top\n\nTotal blocks needed: 4 blocks\n\nFrom the Block Dictionary, I can identify the needed blocks:\n\n1. Base: Block #4 (vertical green rectangular block)\n2. Platform: Block #7 (horizontal yellow rectangular block)\n3. House body: Block #1 (red arch block)\n4. Roof: Block #14 (orange triangular block)\n\nAssembly Order (bottom to top):\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThis assembly sequence will create the exact structure shown in the target image, with each block matching the correct orientation and color as provided in the block dictionary.",

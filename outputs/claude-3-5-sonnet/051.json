Start with base - horizontal green block (index 7)\n2. Add left yellow vertical support (index 13)\n3. Add right yellow vertical support (index 14)\n4. Add bottom red cube in center (index 4)\n5. Add blue cube above red cube (index 1)\n6. Add top red cube above blue cube (index 4)\n7. Add green horizontal block on top (index 6)\n\nAssembly instructions in required format:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n}\n\nNote: The assembly sequence ensures stability by building from bottom to top, with the vertical supports placed early to contain the center blocks.",

A more complex structure with:\n   - Two yellow horizontal blocks (top and bottom)\n   - Two vertical green blocks on the sides\n   - Red and blue blocks in the middle forming a pattern\n\nLet me break down the assembly for each structure:\n\nFor the red house structure:\n- It uses block #1 (red arch base)\n- It uses block #13 (orange triangular roof)\n\nFor the complex structure:\n- Two yellow horizontal pieces (blocks #10 and #11)\n- Two vertical green pieces (blocks #7 and #8)\n- One red block (block #5)\n- One blue block (block #4)\n\nHere's the assembly order:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block #11 (bottom yellow block)\n    Step2: Move block #7 (left green vertical block)\n    Step3: Move block #8 (right green vertical block)\n    Step4: Move block #5 (red square block)\n    Step5: Move block #4 (blue square block)\n    Step6: Move block #10 (top yellow block)\n    Step7: Move block #1 (red arch base)\n    Step8: Move block #13 (orange triangular roof)\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence places the base first, then builds up the walls, adds the interior blocks, and finally places the top pieces. For the house structure, the base is placed first followed by the roof piece.",

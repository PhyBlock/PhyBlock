Starts with the red arch bases (blocks 1 and 2)\n2. Adds the yellow semicircular piece (block 14)\n3. Places the blue and yellow vertical blocks (blocks 6, 11, 12)\n4. Adds the orange and green blocks\n5. Finishes with the house-like structure using the triangular pieces (blocks 15 and 16)\n\nThe blocks are arranged to create a clear train-like structure with a house component at the end, maintaining stability through proper base support and vertical stacking.",

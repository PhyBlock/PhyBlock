A locomotive (left side) with:\n   - Orange cylindrical wheels\n   - Green rectangular base\n   - Red and blue cubic blocks stacked vertically\n\n2. A carriage (right side) with:\n   - Red arched base\n   - Yellow cylindrical loads\n   - Blue and red house-like structure with orange roof\n   - Green and yellow vertical blocks at the back\n\nAnalysis of layers and spatial relationships complete, here's the assembly sequence:\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 11\n    Step10: Move block with index 3\n    Step11: Move block with index 5\n    Step12: Move block with index 15\n    Step13: Move block with index 7\n    Step14: Move block with index 9\n    Step15: Move block with index 15\n}\n\nThis sequence builds from bottom to top, starting with the locomotive, then the carriage, ensuring stability throughout the construction process.",

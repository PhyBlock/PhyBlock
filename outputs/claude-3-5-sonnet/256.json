First the base arches with blocks 1 and 2\n2. Build up the central structure with the solid blocks\n3. Add the circular opening components\n4. Top it off with the yellow blocks\n5. Complete the right side with the colored cube sequence\n\nThe final structure will match the target image exactly, using the blocks as they appear in the dictionary without any rotation.",

The left structure has a base layer of red arches, a middle layer of green and blue blocks, and a top layer of an orange triangle and a blue block. The right structure has a base layer of a red arch, a middle layer of blue blocks, and a top layer of a red arch.\n\n#### Spatial Relationships:\n- **Left Structure:**\n  - The base layer consists of two red arches.\n  - The middle layer includes a yellow rectangular block spanning between the arches, with a green block on one side and a blue block on the other.\n  - The top layer features an orange triangular block on top of the blue block and another blue block above the green block.\n- **Right Structure:**\n  - The base layer is a single red arch.\n  - The middle layer consists of two blue blocks placed inside the arch.\n  - The top layer is another red arch placed horizontally.\n\n### Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are as follows:\n- Red Arch (Index 1)\n- Red Arch (Index 2)\n- Red Arch (Index 3)\n- Yellow Rectangular Block (Index 8)\n- Green Block (Index 9)\n- Blue Block (Index 10)\n- Orange Triangle (Index 15)\n- Blue Block (Index 11)\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 8\n   Step4: Move block with index 9\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 15\n   Step7: Move block with index 11\n   Step8: Move block with index 3\n}",

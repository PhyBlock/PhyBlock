There are three distinct layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The bottom layer has four blocks, with two green blocks on the left and right sides, and two orange blocks in the middle.\n  - The middle layer has three blocks, with one blue block in the center and two orange blocks on either side.\n  - The top layer has three blocks, with one blue block in the center and two orange triangular blocks forming a roof-like structure.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are:\n- Blue cube (index 7)\n- Green cube (index 2)\n- Orange cube (index 3)\n- Orange triangular block (index 14)\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nThe step-by-step assembly sequence is as follows:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 2\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 2\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 7\n   Step6: Move block with index 3\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 14\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 14\n}",

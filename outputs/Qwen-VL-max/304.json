Each structure has a base layer, a middle layer, and a top layer.\n  - The left structure has a total of 3 blocks: one yellow block on the bottom, one green block in the middle, and one yellow block on top.\n  - The right structure has a total of 5 blocks: one yellow block on the bottom, one green block in the middle, one red block above it, one blue block above that, and one yellow block on top.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - In the left structure, the green block is directly above the bottom yellow block, and the top yellow block is directly above the green block.\n  - In the right structure, the green block is directly above the bottom yellow block, the red block is directly above the green block, the blue block is directly above the red block, and the top yellow block is directly above the blue block.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Left Structure:**\n  - Bottom Layer: Yellow block (Index 11)\n  - Middle Layer: Green block (Index 7)\n  - Top Layer: Yellow block (Index 11)\n\n- **Right Structure:**\n  - Bottom Layer: Yellow block (Index 11)\n  - Middle Layer: Green block (Index 7)\n  - Second Layer: Red block (Index 4)\n  - Third Layer: Blue block (Index 1)\n  - Top Layer: Yellow block (Index 11)\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 11,\n  Step2: Move block with index 7,\n  Step3: Move block with index 11,\n  Step4: Move block with index 11,\n  Step5: Move block with index 7,\n  Step6: Move block with index 4,\n  Step7: Move block with index 1,\n  Step8: Move block with index 11\n}\n```",

There are three distinct layers.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The bottom layer includes two red arch-shaped blocks (one on the left and one on the right).\n  - On top of the left arch, there is a blue block with an orange roof and a yellow cylindrical block to its right.\n  - Above these, there is a green block with an orange roof.\n  - On the right side, there is another set of blocks forming a similar structure but with a different arrangement.\n  - The middle layer includes various shapes such as rectangular blocks, triangular roofs, and a half-cylinder.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are:\n- Red arch-shaped blocks (indices 1 and 3)\n- Blue block (index 5)\n- Orange roof (index 14)\n- Yellow cylindrical block (index 10)\n- Green block (index 9)\n- Various other blocks matching the shapes and colors in the target image.\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 14\n   Step5: Move block with index 10\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n   ...\n   Stepn: Move block with index {idx}\n}",

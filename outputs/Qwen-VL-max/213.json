The left structure has a base layer of two cylindrical blocks, a middle layer of three rectangular blocks, and a top layer of one semi-circular block. The right structure has a base layer of two cylindrical blocks, a middle layer of one arch-shaped block, and a top layer of one triangular block.\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- **Left Structure:**\n  - Two orange cylindrical blocks form the base.\n  - A green rectangular block is placed on top of the left cylindrical block.\n  - A blue rectangular block is placed on top of the green block.\n  - A red rectangular block is placed on top of the blue block.\n  - A yellow semi-circular block is placed on top of the red block.\n- **Right Structure:**\n  - Two orange cylindrical blocks form the base.\n  - A yellow horizontal beam connects the two cylindrical blocks.\n  - An orange arch-shaped block is placed on top of the beam.\n  - An orange triangular block is placed on top of the arch-shaped block.\n\n## Select the Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n### Block Indices:\n- **Cylindrical Blocks:** Index 8 (orange)\n- **Green Rectangular Block:** Index 5\n- **Blue Rectangular Block:** Index 2\n- **Red Rectangular Block:** Index 4\n- **Yellow Semi-Circular Block:** Index 10\n- **Yellow Horizontal Beam:** Index 7\n- **Orange Arch-Shaped Block:** Index 1\n- **Orange Triangular Block:** Index 13\n\n## Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n   Step2: Move block with index 8\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 2\n   Step5: Move block with index 4\n   Step6: Move block with index 10\n   Step7: Move block with index 8\n   Step8: Move block with index 8\n   Step9: Move block with index 7\n   Step10: Move block with index 1\n   Step11: Move block with index 13\n}",

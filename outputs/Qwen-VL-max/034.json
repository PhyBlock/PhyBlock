The bottom layer has three blocks, and the top layer has two blocks.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The bottom layer includes a yellow rectangular block at the front (closest to the viewer) and two green rectangular blocks standing vertically behind it.\n  - The top layer features a horizontal yellow rectangular block spanning across the width of the structure, supported by the two vertical green blocks.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Identified Needed Blocks:**\n  - A yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation (matches the top layer).\n  - Two green rectangular blocks in a vertical orientation (matches the middle layer).\n  - A yellow rectangular block in a horizontal orientation (matches the bottom layer).\n\n- **List Block Indices:**\n  - Yellow horizontal block: Index 7\n  - Green vertical block: Index 3\n  - Yellow horizontal block: Index 11\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11,\n    Step2: Move block with index 3,\n    Step3: Move block with index 3,\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that the structure is built layer by layer, starting with the bottom layer and finishing with the top layer.",

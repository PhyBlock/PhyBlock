        "content": "### Analysis of the Main Target Image:\n\n#### Count & Layers:\n- **Block Count:** The structure consists of 16 building blocks.\n- **Layers:** The structure has three distinct layers. The bottom layer is composed of larger, more stable blocks, while the top layer includes smaller and differently shaped blocks.\n\n#### Spatial Relationships:\n- The structure is divided into two main sections: a triangular base on the left and a rectangular extension on the right.\n- The triangular base features a central red block with a circular cutout, flanked by yellow and green blocks.\n- The rectangular extension has a blue block at the top, supported by a green block below it.\n- The blocks are arranged in a way that creates a stable structure, with each block fitting snugly against its neighbors.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required to match the target structure:\n\n- **Red Curved Block (Index 2):** Used for the curved section of the triangular base.\n- **Green Cube (Index 5):** Used for the green block in the middle of the triangular base.\n- **Yellow Cube (Index 6):** Used for the yellow block on the left side of the triangular base.\n- **Blue Cube (Index 4):** Used for the blue block at the top of the rectangular extension.\n- **Green Rectangular Block (Index 7):** Used for the green block supporting the blue block.\n- **Yellow Rectangular Block (Index 10):** Used for the yellow block at the bottom of the rectangular extension.\n- **Orange Triangular Block (Index 15):** Used for the triangular block at the top of the triangular base.\n- **Red Cube with Circular Cutout (Index 3):** Used for the central red block with a circular cutout in the triangular base.\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nTo assemble the structure step-by-step, follow these instructions:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 15\n   Step2: Move block with index 3\n   Step3: Move block with index 6\n   Step4: Move block with index 5\n   Step5: Move block with index 2\n   Step6: Move block with index 10\n   Step7: Move block with index 7\n   Step8: Move block with index 4\n}",

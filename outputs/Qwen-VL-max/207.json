        "content": "### Analysis of the Main Target Image:\n\n- **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 10 blocks arranged in a multi-layered configuration. There are three distinct layers.\n  - **Bottom Layer:** A red block with a circular cutout is supported by two yellow rectangular blocks on either side.\n  - **Middle Layer:** Two orange cylindrical blocks are placed vertically above the red block, connected by a yellow horizontal block.\n  - **Top Layer:** An orange triangular block is positioned at the top.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The red block with the circular cutout is centrally located and serves as the base.\n  - Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on either side of the red block.\n  - Two orange cylindrical blocks are stacked vertically above the red block.\n  - A yellow horizontal block connects the two orange cylindrical blocks.\n  - An orange triangular block is placed at the very top.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required to match the target structure:\n\n- **Red Block with Circular Cutout:** Index 6\n- **Yellow Rectangular Blocks:** Index 7 (used twice)\n- **Orange Cylindrical Blocks:** Index 9 (used twice)\n- **Yellow Horizontal Block:** Index 8\n- **Orange Triangular Block:** Index 16\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nThe assembly order should follow the layering sequence from bottom to top:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 6 (Red block with circular cutout)\n   Step2: Move block with index 7 (Yellow rectangular block) to the left side of the red block\n   Step3: Move block with index 7 (Yellow rectangular block) to the right side of the red block\n   Step4: Move block with index 9 (Orange cylindrical block) above the left yellow block\n   Step5: Move block with index 9 (Orange cylindrical block) above the right yellow block\n   Step6: Move block with index 8 (Yellow horizontal block) to connect the two orange cylindrical blocks\n   Step7: Move block with index 16 (Orange triangular block) to the top\n}",

There are three distinct layers: the base, middle, and top.\n- **Spatial Relationships:** \n  - The base layer includes two red arches (one on the left and one on the right), two green rectangular blocks, and two orange triangular blocks.\n  - The middle layer features a yellow horizontal block connecting the two green vertical blocks, with an orange cylindrical block in the center.\n  - The top layer has a red triangular roof on the left and a yellow horizontal block with a red triangular roof on the right.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are:\n- Red arches: Index 1\n- Green rectangular blocks: Index 5\n- Orange triangular blocks: Index 13\n- Yellow horizontal blocks: Index 7\n- Orange cylindrical block: Index 10\n- Red triangular roofs: Index 14\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1 (Red arch)\n   Step2: Move block with index 1 (Red arch)\n   Step3: Move block with index 5 (Green rectangular block)\n   Step4: Move block with index 5 (Green rectangular block)\n   Step5: Move block with index 13 (Orange triangular block)\n   Step6: Move block with index 13 (Orange triangular block)\n   Step7: Move block with index 10 (Orange cylindrical block)\n   Step8: Move block with index 7 (Yellow horizontal block)\n   Step9: Move block with index 7 (Yellow horizontal block)\n   Step10: Move block with index 14 (Red triangular roof)\n   Step11: Move block with index 14 (Red triangular roof)\n}",

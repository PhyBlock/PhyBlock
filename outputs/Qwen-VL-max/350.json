Each structure has a total of 7 blocks, making it a 2-layer structure.\n  - **Structure on the Left:**\n    - Bottom Layer: A yellow rectangular block (base).\n    - Middle Layer: Two orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically.\n    - Top Layer: A red arch-shaped block with an opening in the middle, and two blue square blocks placed side by side.\n  - **Structure on the Right:**\n    - Bottom Layer: A red arch-shaped block with an opening in the middle.\n    - Middle Layer: An orange cylindrical block standing vertically.\n    - Top Layer: A yellow rectangular block, a green rectangular block, and an orange triangular block.\n\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The left structure has the yellow base supporting the two orange cylinders, which in turn support the red arch and blue squares.\n  - The right structure has the red arch as its base, with the orange cylinder standing on it, and the yellow, green, and orange blocks forming the top layer.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\n- **Left Structure:**\n  - Yellow rectangular block (base): Index 10\n  - Orange cylindrical blocks: Index 12\n  - Red arch-shaped block: Index 1\n  - Blue square blocks: Index 6\n\n- **Right Structure:**\n  - Red arch-shaped block: Index 1\n  - Orange cylindrical block: Index 12\n  - Yellow rectangular block: Index 10\n  - Green rectangular block: Index 7\n  - Orange triangular block: Index 15\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n```json\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 10 (Yellow rectangular block for the left structure's base)\n  Step2: Move block with index 12 (Orange cylindrical block for the left structure)\n  Step3: Move block with index 12 (Second orange cylindrical block for the left structure)\n  Step4: Move block with index 1 (Red arch-shaped block for the left structure)\n  Step5: Move block with index 6 (Blue square block for the left structure)\n  Step6: Move block with index 6 (Second blue square block for the left structure)\n  Step7: Move block with index 1 (Red arch-shaped block for the right structure's base)\n  Step8: Move block with index 12 (Orange cylindrical block for the right structure)\n  Step9: Move block with index 10 (Yellow rectangular block for the right structure)\n  Step10: Move block with index 7 (Green rectangular block for the right structure)\n  Step11: Move block with index 15 (Orange triangular block for the right structure)\n}\n```",

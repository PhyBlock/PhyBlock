There are two primary structures: a bridge-like formation on the left and a house-like structure on the right.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The bridge-like structure is composed of red arch blocks (indices 1, 2) at the base, with various colored blocks stacked on top.\n  - The house-like structure has a red arch block (index 3) as its base, topped with an orange triangular roof (index 15).\n  - A yellow rectangular block (index 9) spans between the two structures.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are:\n- Red arch blocks (indices 1, 2, 3)\n- Blue cube (index 6)\n- Green rectangular block (index 8)\n- Yellow rectangular blocks (indices 9, 10, 11, 13)\n- Orange rectangular block (index 7)\n- Orange triangular roof (index 15)\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 6\n   Step5: Move block with index 8\n   Step6: Move block with index 9\n   Step7: Move block with index 10\n   Step8: Move block with index 11\n   Step9: Move block with index 13\n   Step10: Move block with index 7\n   Step11: Move block with index 15\n}",

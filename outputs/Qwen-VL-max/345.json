There are at least three distinct layers, with some blocks stacked vertically and others placed side by side.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The bottom layer includes two red arches (blocks) positioned horizontally.\n  - Above these arches, there are two yellow rectangular blocks and one blue cube.\n  - On top of the blue cube, there is a red triangular roof block.\n  - To the right, there is another set of blocks including a green block, a yellow half-cylinder, and another red triangular roof block.\n  - The arrangement suggests a symmetrical design with a central focus on the blue cube and its surrounding blocks.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are:\n- Red arch: Index 1\n- Yellow rectangular block: Index 9\n- Blue cube: Index 3\n- Green block: Index 4\n- Yellow half-cylinder: Index 12\n- Red triangular roof block: Index 15\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\nThe assembly order should follow the spatial relationships observed in the target image:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1 (Red arch)\n   Step2: Move block with index 1 (Red arch)\n   Step3: Move block with index 9 (Yellow rectangular block)\n   Step4: Move block with index 9 (Yellow rectangular block)\n   Step5: Move block with index 3 (Blue cube)\n   Step6: Move block with index 15 (Red triangular roof block)\n   Step7: Move block with index 4 (Green block)\n   Step8: Move block with index 12 (Yellow half-cylinder)\n   Step9: Move block with index 15 (Red triangular roof block)\n}",

Above this, there is a blue cube, followed by a green rectangular block, and finally an orange triangular roof.\n- The right part consists of two blue blocks at the bottom, supporting a yellow horizontal beam. Above this, there is a red cube, a green rectangular block, and an orange triangular roof.\n\n### Selecting Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are as follows:\n- Red Arch: Index 2\n- Blue Cube: Index 5\n- Green Rectangular Block: Index 6\n- Orange Triangular Roof: Index 15\n- Yellow Horizontal Beam: Index 10\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9 (Green Base)\n   Step2: Move block with index 2 (Red Arch)\n   Step3: Move block with index 5 (Blue Cube)\n   Step4: Move block with index 6 (Green Rectangular Block)\n   Step5: Move block with index 15 (Orange Triangular Roof)\n   Step6: Move block with index 5 (Blue Cube)\n   Step7: Move block with index 5 (Blue Cube)\n   Step8: Move block with index 10 (Yellow Horizontal Beam)\n   Step9: Move block with index 5 (Blue Cube)\n   Step10: Move block with index 6 (Green Rectangular Block)\n   Step11: Move block with index 7 (Red Cube)\n   Step12: Move block with index 6 (Green Rectangular Block)\n   Step13: Move block with index 15 (Orange Triangular Roof)\n}",

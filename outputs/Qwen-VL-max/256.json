There are two primary layers, with some blocks stacked on top of others.\n- **Spatial Relationships:**\n  - The base layer includes four red arches (blocks) forming a rectangular frame.\n  - On top of this frame, there is a sequence of blocks: a green cube, a blue cube, and two yellow cubes.\n  - To the left of this sequence, there is a vertical stack of three blocks: a red block with a circular cutout at the bottom, a yellow rectangular block in the middle, and another yellow rectangular block on top.\n\n### Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the required blocks are:\n- Red arches: Index 1, 2, 3, 4\n- Red block with a circular cutout: Index 5\n- Yellow rectangular blocks: Index 13, 15\n- Green cube: Index 9\n- Blue cube: Index 8\n- Yellow cubes: Index 11, 16\n\n### Assembly Order:\n\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1\n   Step2: Move block with index 2\n   Step3: Move block with index 3\n   Step4: Move block with index 4\n   Step5: Move block with index 5\n   Step6: Move block with index 13\n   Step7: Move block with index 15\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n   Step9: Move block with index 8\n   Step10: Move block with index 11\n   Step11: Move block with index 16\n}",

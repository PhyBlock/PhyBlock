Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure consists of 3 building blocks\n- Colors are blue, yellow, and red\n- Blocks are arranged in a unique configuration:\n   * Red block forms an arch/base at the bottom\n   * Yellow block sits on top of the red block\n   * Blue block is positioned on top of the yellow block, slightly offset\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\n- Red arch block: Index 1\n- Yellow cube block: Index 13\n- Blue cube block: Index 9\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n   Step2: Move block with index 13 (yellow cube) on top of red arch\n   Step3: Move block with index 9 (blue cube) on top of yellow cube\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the exact spatial arrangement shown in the target image, using blocks from the dictionary without any rotation. Each block is placed precisely as it appears in the reference images.",

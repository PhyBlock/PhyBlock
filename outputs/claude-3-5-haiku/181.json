Left Structure (3 blocks):\n     - Top: Green block\n     - Middle: Red block with a curved side\n     - Bottom: Blue block\n  2. Right Structure (4 blocks):\n     - Top: Blue block\n     - Middle: Yellow block\n     - Bottom: Two orange cylindrical blocks (serving as a base)\n\nBlock Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks by index:\n1. Block 3 (Red curved block)\n2. Block 5 (Blue cube)\n3. Block 6 (Green cube)\n4. Block 7 (Yellow cube)\n5. Block 8 (Green rectangular block)\n6. Block 16 (Orange cylindrical block)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 16\n    Step2: Move block with index 16\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n}\n\nThis sequence reconstructs the structure by first placing the base cylindrical blocks, then adding the yellow and blue blocks on top, followed by the red curved block, and finally the green blocks to complete the arrangement.",

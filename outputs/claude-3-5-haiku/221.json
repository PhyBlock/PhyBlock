Block 2 (red curved block)\n2. Block 11 (yellow rectangular block)\n3. Block 3 (blue cube)\n4. Block 5 (red cube)\n5. Block 12 (orange triangular block)\n\nFor the right structure, I'll need:\n1. Block 11 (yellow rectangular block)\n2. Block 5 (red cube)\n3. Block 7 (blue cube)\n4. Block 4 (green cube)\n5. Block 6 (red cube)\n6. Block 15 (orange triangular block)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 4\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n    Step12: Move block with index 15\n}",

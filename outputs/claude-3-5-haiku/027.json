Analyzing the Main Target Image:\n- Total Blocks: 6 blocks\n- Colors: Red and Yellow\n- Layers: 3 layers\n- Structure: \n  * Bottom layer: 2 yellow rectangular blocks supporting 2 red cylindrical blocks\n  * Middle layer: 1 yellow rectangular block crossing the red cylindrical blocks\n  * Top layer: 1 red house/peaked block sitting on top of the structure\n\n2. Selecting Blocks from the Dictionary:\nRequired blocks:\n- Block 5/6/7 (Yellow rectangular block)\n- Block 8 (Red cylindrical block)\n- Block 9 (Red cylindrical block)\n- Block 11 (Red house/peaked block)\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block 8 (red cylinder)\n    Step2: Move block 9 (red cylinder)\n    Step3: Move block 5 (yellow rectangular block)\n    Step4: Move block 11 (red house/peaked block)\n}\n\nThe assembly sequence follows the bottom-up approach, starting with the base and progressively building up to the final structure.",

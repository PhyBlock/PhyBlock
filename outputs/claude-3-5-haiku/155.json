Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure consists of 3 blocks\n- First layer: Two green rectangular base blocks\n- Second layer: One yellow rectangular block on the right green base\n- Third layer: One orange cylindrical block on the right, with a yellow curved top\n- Fourth layer: An orange cylindrical block with a triangular top on the left green base\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Block 1: Green rectangular base (horizontal)\n- Block 4: Yellow rectangular block (horizontal)\n- Block 8: Orange cylindrical block\n- Block 10: Yellow curved top block\n- Block 15: Orange block with triangular top\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (green base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (second green base)\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (yellow rectangle on right base)\n    Step4: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder on right)\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (yellow curved top)\n    Step6: Move block with index 15 (orange triangular top block on left base)\n}\n\nThis sequence matches the target image's structure and uses blocks exactly as they appear in the dictionary.",

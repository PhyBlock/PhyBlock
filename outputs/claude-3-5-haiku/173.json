Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure consists of 2 distinct block configurations\n- Left configuration: \n  * 1 green block on top\n  * 3 orange cylindrical blocks underneath\n- Right configuration:\n  * 1 yellow block on top\n  * 1 red block with circular cutout in middle\n  * 2 green blocks on sides\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\n- Orange cylinders: Block index 15 and 16\n- Green rectangular blocks: Block index 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n- Red curved block: Block indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n- Yellow rectangular block: Block indices 13, 14\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 15\n    Step2: Move block with index 16\n    Step3: Move block with index 8 (green top block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 4 (red curved block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 11 (green side block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 12 (green side block)\n    Step7: Move block with index 13 (yellow top block)\n}\n\nThis solution precisely matches the target structure using blocks from the dictionary.",

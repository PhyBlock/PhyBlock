Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure consists of 3 blocks total\n- 2 red curved blocks forming a U-shape\n- 2 blue cubic blocks inserted through the red curved blocks\n- Total layers: 1 primary layer with interlocking blocks\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks:\n- Red curved block (index 1 or 2)\n- Blue cubic block (index 9)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red curved block)\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (blue cubic block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 (second red curved block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 9 (second blue cubic block)\n}\n\nKey observations:\n- The blocks are precisely positioned to interlock\n- The red curved blocks form a U-shape\n- The blue cubic blocks pass through the openings of the red blocks\n- Exact orientation from the dictionary must be maintained\n\nThe assembly requires carefully placing the blocks to match the intricate interlocking arrangement shown in the target image.",

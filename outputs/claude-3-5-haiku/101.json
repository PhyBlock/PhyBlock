Analyze the Main Target Image:\n   - The structure consists of 3 blocks\n   - It has 3 layers vertically\n   - Colors from bottom to top: red, green, orange\n   - Bottom layer is a double-width block\n   - Top layer is a triangular/sloped block\n\n2. Select Blocks from Dictionary:\n   Based on the colors and shapes, we need:\n   - Block 4 (red rectangular block)\n   - Block 6 (green rectangular block)\n   - Block 11 (orange triangular/sloped block)\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n   {\n      Step1: Move block with index 4 (red block)\n      Step2: Move block with index 6 (green block) on top of red block\n      Step3: Move block with index 11 (orange triangular block) on top of green block\n   }\n\nThis sequence will recreate the structure in the main target image, using the exact blocks from the dictionary with their specific orientations.",

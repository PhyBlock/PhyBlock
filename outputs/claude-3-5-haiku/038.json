Main Target Image Analysis:\n- The first image shows a red block with a circular cutout, split into two halves vertically\n- This appears to be a single block that is positioned in the center of a dark, grid-like background\n\n2. Block Dictionary Analysis:\n- The second image contains 8 different block orientations/configurations (labeled 1-8)\n- All blocks are red and have a curved/cutout feature\n- Blocks vary in their shape, curve orientation, and positioning\n\n3. Block Selection:\nTo precisely recreate the target image, I would select:\n- Block #8: This matches the vertical split configuration with the circular cutout\n\n4. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 8\n}\n\nThis task requires recreating the exact block from the dictionary, positioned centrally on the grid. The block from index 8 matches the target image's shape, color, and orientation perfectly.\n\nThe solution is straightforward in this case - a single block placement using the matching dictionary block.",

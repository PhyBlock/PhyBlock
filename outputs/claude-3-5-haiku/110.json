Analysis of Target Structure:\n- Total Blocks: 7 blocks\n- Layers: 4 layers (bottom to top)\n- Colors from bottom to top: Yellow, Blue, Red, Green, Orange\n- Unique block shapes and orientations observed\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Bottom layer (Yellow): Block 9 (long rectangular yellow block)\n- Second layer: Block 3 (Blue cube)\n- Third layer: Block 1 (Red curved block)\n- Fourth layer: Block 4 (Green cube)\n- Top layer: Block 16 (Orange triangular block)\n- Additional blocks needed: Block 6 (Yellow cube), Block 8 (Green rectangular block)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 16\n}\n\nThe instructions follow the exact block indices from the dictionary, matching the target structure's colors, shapes, and spatial arrangement.",

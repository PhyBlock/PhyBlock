Red arch/curved block at the bottom\n  2. Yellow curved/rounded block in the middle\n  3. Orange triangular block at the top\n\nBlock Dictionary Analysis:\n- Block 1: Red arch/curved block (matches bottom of target image)\n- Block 6: Yellow curved block (matches middle of target image)\n- Block 14: Orange triangular block (matches top of target image)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the bottom-to-top order seen in the target image, using the exact blocks from the dictionary with their specific orientations.\n\nBlock Selection Verification:\n- Block 1 matches the red arch/curved block\n- Block 6 matches the yellow curved block\n- Block 14 matches the orange triangular block\n\nThese blocks precisely match the shape, color, and orientation of the blocks in the target structure.",

Main Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure consists of two separate block configurations\n- Left configuration (Vehicle-like):\n  * 3 layers tall\n  * Yellow curved top block\n  * Blue, green, and red blocks in middle layer\n  * Orange cylindrical blocks as base/wheels\n- Right configuration (Building-like):\n  * 3 layers tall\n  * Blue cube on top\n  * Green and red blocks in middle layer\n  * Red arch block on bottom\n  * Orange cylindrical blocks on side\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Left configuration:\n  * Yellow curved top (Block 13)\n  * Blue cube (Block 4)\n  * Green rectangular block (Block 6)\n  * Red cube (Block 5)\n  * Two orange cylinders (Block 11 and Block 12)\n\n- Right configuration:\n  * Blue cube (Block 4)\n  * Green rectangular block (Block 7)\n  * Red arch block (Block 1)\n  * Two orange cylinders (Block 10 and Block 11)\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 6 (green rectangular)\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder)\n    Step5: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder)\n    Step6: Move block with index 5 (red cube)\n    Step7: Move block with index 13 (yellow curved top)\n    Step8: Move block with index 11 (orange cylinder)\n    Step9: Move block with index 12 (orange cylinder)\n}",

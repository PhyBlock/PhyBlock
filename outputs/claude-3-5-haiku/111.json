Red curved block (index 3)\n2. Blue cube (index 9)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 9 (placing it on top of the red block)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the precise configuration shown in the main target image, using the exact blocks from the dictionary without any rotation or modification.\n\nThe red block (index 3) forms a wave-like base, and the blue cube (index 9) is placed on top, creating a two-layered structure that matches the target image exactly.",

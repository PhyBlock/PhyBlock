Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure has 2 distinct sections\n- Left section (orange/green):\n  * Consists of 3 green vertical blocks\n  * 2 orange triangular blocks\n  * Appears as a multi-layered, asymmetric construction\n- Right section (red/yellow/blue):\n  * Consists of yellow curved/rectangular blocks\n  * 1 red curved block\n  * 1 blue rectangular block\n  * Also multi-layered with varied block orientations\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Green vertical blocks: #5 (x2), #7 (x1)\n- Orange triangular blocks: #14, #15, #16\n- Yellow blocks: #8, #10, #11, #12, #13\n- Red curved block: #1\n- Blue rectangular block: #2\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n  Step1: Move block #2 (blue rectangular block)\n  Step2: Move block #1 (red curved block)\n  Step3: Move block #13 (yellow rectangular block)\n  Step4: Move block #10 (yellow curved block)\n  Step5: Move block #5 (green vertical block)\n  Step6: Move block #5 (green vertical block)\n  Step7: Move block #7 (green vertical block)\n  Step8: Move block #14 (orange triangular block)\n  Step9: Move block #15 (orange triangular block)\n  Step10: Move block #16 (orange triangular block)\n}",

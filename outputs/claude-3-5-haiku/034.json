Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure consists of:\n  * 2 green vertical rectangular blocks\n  * 2 yellow rectangular blocks (one at top, one at bottom)\n- Structure is 3 layers high\n- Green blocks are positioned vertically in the center\n- Yellow blocks form base and top platforms\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\n- Green vertical block (index 3 or 4)\n- Green horizontal block (index 1, 2, 5, or 6)\n- Yellow horizontal block (index 7, 8, 11, or 12)\n- Yellow vertical block (index 9 or 10)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1 (green horizontal)\n   Step2: Move block with index 1 (green horizontal)\n   Step3: Move block with index 9 (yellow vertical bottom)\n   Step4: Move block with index 10 (yellow vertical top)\n}\n\nThe goal is to create a structure with two green blocks vertically aligned, sandwiched between yellow horizontal/vertical blocks at the base and top.",

Block 1 (Red arch/bridge)\n2. Block 6 (Red cube)\n3. Block 8 (Yellow rectangular block)\n4. Block 4 (Blue cube)\n5. Block 10 (Yellow vertical rectangular block)\n6. Block 5 (Green cube)\n7. Block 14 (Orange angled block)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the structure in the main image, starting with the red arch base, then adding blocks layer by layer to create the final complex geometric configuration.",

Base layer: Green blocks at bottom\n  2. Middle layer: Yellow blocks with Blue and Red blocks inserted\n  3. Top layer: Green block on top\n\nBlock Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Green blocks: 8 and 12\n- Yellow blocks: 10 and 15\n- Blue block: 7\n- Red block: 9\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 13 (yellow base)\n   Step2: Move block with index 9 (red cube)\n   Step3: Move block with index 7 (blue cube)\n   Step4: Move block with index 10 (yellow cube)\n   Step5: Move block with index 8 (green block)\n   Step6: Move block with index 12 (green block on top)\n}\n\nThe instructions follow the exact block orientations and colors from the dictionary image, matching the target structure precisely.",

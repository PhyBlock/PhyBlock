Blue cube (Block 5)\n2. Green rectangular block (Block 9)\n3. Red curved block (Block 1)\n4. Red cube (Block 7)\n5. Yellow rectangular block (Block 12)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12 (yellow long block) as base\n    Step2: Move block with index 7 (red cube) on top of yellow base\n    Step3: Move block with index 9 (green rectangular block) next to red cube\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (blue cube) on top of green block\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (red curved block) adjacent to structure\n}\n\nThe instructions create a structure matching the visual configuration in the target image.",

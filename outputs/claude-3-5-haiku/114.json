Two orange triangular/wedge-shaped blocks (sides)\n- The blue block is vertically positioned\n- The orange blocks are positioned at an angle on either side of the blue block\n\nBlock Dictionary Selection:\nBased on the dictionary, I'll select these specific blocks:\n- Block 1: Blue cube\n- Block 3: Orange cube\n- Block 6: Orange wedge/triangular block\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (blue cube)\n    Step2: Move block with index 3 (orange cube) to one side\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (orange wedge) to the other side\n}\n\nThis sequence matches the target image's configuration exactly, using the blocks as they appear in the dictionary without any rotation.\n\nThe key is to match the color, shape, and orientation precisely as shown in the source images.",

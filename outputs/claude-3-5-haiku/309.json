Red arch base blocks (indices 1, 2, 3) - multiple times\n2. Orange house/triangular roof blocks (indices 13, 14, 15, 16)\n3. Blue cube block (index 4)\n4. Green blocks (indices 5, 7, 8)\n5. Yellow blocks (indices 9, 10, 11, 12)\n\nAssembly Sequence:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (red arch base)\n    Step3: Move block with index 13 (orange house block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (green cube)\n    Step5: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step6: Move block with index 9 (yellow rectangular block)\n    Step7: Move block with index 10 (yellow vertical block)\n    Step8: Move block with index 14 (orange house block)\n    Step9: Move block with index 7 (green rectangular block)\n    Step10: Move block with index 11 (yellow curved block)\n    Step11: Move block with index 16 (orange roof block)\n}\n\nThe sequence follows the visual arrangement, creating a complex, multi-layered structure with precise block placement.",

Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure composed of yellow and red blocks\n- 2 layers total\n- Bottom layer: 2 yellow curved/semi-circular blocks\n- Top layer: 1 yellow rectangular block and 1 red triangular block\n- Blocks are arranged to form a vehicle-like or bridge-like structure\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Yellow semi-circular blocks: Block #5 and #6\n- Yellow rectangular block: Block #1\n- Red triangular block: Block #10\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block #5 (yellow semi-circular)\n    Step2: Move block #6 (yellow semi-circular) adjacent to block #5\n    Step3: Move block #1 (yellow rectangular) on top of the curved blocks\n    Step4: Move block #10 (red triangular) on top of the rectangular block\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the structure shown in the main target image.",

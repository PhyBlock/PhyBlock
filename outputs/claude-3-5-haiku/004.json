Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure consists of 2 blocks: a red arch-like base block (from dictionary) and an orange triangular top block (also from dictionary)\n- The base block has a curved arch/tunnel shape\n- The top block is a small triangular/wedge-shaped block\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\n- Base Block: Block 2 (red arch block)\n- Top Block: Block 14 (orange triangular/wedge block)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 14 on top of block 2\n}\n\nThe assembly follows a simple two-step process:\n- First, place the red arch block (index 2)\n- Then, place the orange triangular block (index 14) on top of the arch block\n\nThis matches the target image exactly, using the blocks in their original orientation from the dictionary.",

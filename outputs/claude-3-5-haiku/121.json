Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure consists of 3 blocks:\n  * 2 orange cylindrical/rounded blocks at the base\n  * 1 green rectangular block on top\n  * 1 orange triangular/angled block partially overlapping the green block\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\n- Green Blocks (index 1-4):\n  * Need block index 2 (horizontal green rectangular block)\n- Orange Cylinders (index 5-8):\n  * Need block index 5 (horizontal orange cylinder)\n- Orange Triangular Blocks (index 9-16):\n  * Need block index 11 (orange triangular block)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the target structure using the exact blocks from the dictionary, maintaining their original orientation and positioning.",

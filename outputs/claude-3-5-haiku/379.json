Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure consists of 6 blocks in total\n- Colors used: Orange (cylindrical), Green (rectangular), Yellow (curved/rectangular)\n- Layers: 2 layers\n- Structure has two vertical orange cylindrical blocks as a base\n- A yellow rectangular block spans across these orange cylinders\n- Another configuration exists with a green rectangular block and a yellow curved block\n\n2. Block Dictionary Identification:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Orange vertical cylinder: Index 10 & 11\n- Yellow rectangular block spanning horizontally: Index 9\n- Green rectangular block: Index 1 or 5\n- Yellow curved block: Index 12 or 13\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10 (orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step2: Move block with index 11 (second orange vertical cylinder)\n    Step3: Move block with index 9 (yellow horizontal rectangular block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (green rectangular block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 12 (yellow curved block)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the spatial relationships seen in the target image, using the exact block orientations from the dictionary.",

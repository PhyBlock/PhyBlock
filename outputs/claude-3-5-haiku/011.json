Target Image Analysis:\n- Structure has 7 blocks total\n- Colors: Green (center), Blue (surrounding sides), Orange (outer sections)\n- 2 layers: A central top layer and a wider bottom layer\n- Compact, symmetrical design with blue blocks acting as connectors\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\nRequired blocks:\n- Block 2 (Green cube, center top)\n- Block 1 & 6 (Blue cubes, side connectors)\n- Block 3 & 7 (Orange blocks, outer sections)\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 (green cube to center)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (blue cube to left side)\n    Step3: Move block with index 6 (blue cube to right side)\n    Step4: Move block with index 3 (orange block to left outer section)\n    Step5: Move block with index 7 (orange block to right outer section)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows a symmetric pattern, creating a balanced, structured design with the green cube at the center, blue cubes connecting the sides, and orange blocks forming the outer sections.",

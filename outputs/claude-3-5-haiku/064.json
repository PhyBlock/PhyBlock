Main Target Image Analysis:\n- The structure is composed of 3 layers\n- Bottom layer: 2 red arch-like blocks\n- Middle layer: 1 yellow rectangular block\n- Top layer: 1 red arch-like block\n- Colors are red and yellow\n- Blocks have specific arch/curved and rectangular shapes\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\n- Red Arch Blocks: Indices 1, 2, 5, 6 (slightly different orientations)\n- Yellow Rectangular Blocks: Indices 9, 10, 13, 14\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 1 (bottom left red arch)\n   Step2: Move block with index 2 (bottom right red arch)\n   Step3: Move block with index 10 (yellow rectangular block connecting the red arches)\n   Step4: Move block with index 6 (top red arch)\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the structure exactly as shown in the main target image, using blocks from the dictionary with their precise orientations and shapes.",

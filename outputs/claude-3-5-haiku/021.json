Main Target Image Analysis:\n- Total Blocks: 8 blocks\n- Layers: 3-4 layers high\n- Color Sequence (from bottom): Red (arch), Yellow, Green, Blue, Orange (slanted)\n- Structure sits on two red arch-shaped blocks\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks by index:\n- Red blocks: 1 & 2 (arch base)\n- Yellow block: 10\n- Green blocks: 6\n- Blue block: 8\n- Orange block: 14\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block 1 (red arch base)\n    Step2: Move block 2 (red arch base extension)\n    Step3: Move block 10 (yellow horizontal block)\n    Step4: Move block 6 (green cube)\n    Step5: Move another block 6 (green cube)\n    Step6: Move block 8 (blue cube)\n    Step7: Move block 14 (orange slanted block)\n}\n\nThe structure is built systematically, layer by layer, using the exact blocks from the dictionary with their original orientations.",

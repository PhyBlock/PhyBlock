Analyze the Main Target Image:\n- Total blocks: 4 blocks\n- Colors: Red (base arch), Blue (rectangular block), Yellow (curved/arched block), Orange (triangular roof)\n- Layers: 3 layers\n- Structure: Starts with a red arch, then a blue rectangular block, a yellow curved block, topped with an orange triangular roof\n\n2. Select Required Blocks from Dictionary:\n- Red arch block: Index 1\n- Blue rectangular block: Index 5\n- Yellow curved block: Index 7\n- Orange triangular roof block: Index 10\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n    Step2: Move block with index 5 (blue rectangular block on top of arch)\n    Step3: Move block with index 7 (yellow curved block next to blue block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 10 (orange triangular roof on top of blue block)\n}\n\nThis sequence will recreate the structure exactly as shown in the main target image, using the blocks from the dictionary in their precise orientations.",

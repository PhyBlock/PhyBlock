Target Structure Analysis:\n- Total Blocks: 6 blocks\n- Colors: Green (center), Blue (connecting sides), Orange (outer blocks)\n- Layers: Multiple layers, with a central green block surrounded by blue and orange blocks\n- Spatial Arrangement: Complex 3D structure with blocks interconnected at various angles\n\n2. Required Blocks from Dictionary:\n- Block 2 (Green cube) - for center\n- Block 1 and Block 5 (Blue cubes) - for side/connecting blocks\n- Block 9, Block 10, Block 11 (Orange rectangular blocks) - for outer structure\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2 (green cube) to center\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (blue cube) to side\n    Step3: Move block with index 5 (blue cube) to opposite side\n    Step4: Move block with index 9 (orange block) to outer position\n    Step5: Move block with index 10 (orange block) to another outer position\n    Step6: Move block with index 11 (orange block) to final outer position\n}\n\nThe assembly follows a precise spatial arrangement to match the target image exactly.",

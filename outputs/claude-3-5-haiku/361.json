Yellow blocks at the top and bottom\n  2. A vertical arrangement of colored blocks in the middle\n  3. Blocks are positioned on yellow base blocks\n\nLeft Structure:\n- Red block with a curved/hollowed-out section\n- Yellow blocks on top and bottom\n\nRight Structure:\n- Vertical arrangement of blocks:\n  1. Red block\n  2. Blue block\n  3. Green block\n- Yellow blocks on top and bottom\n\nBlock Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks:\n- Yellow horizontal blocks (index 15 or 16)\n- Red block with curved section (index 1, 2, 5, or 6)\n- Solid red block (index 8)\n- Blue block (index 7)\n- Green blocks (index 9, 10, or 12)\n\nAssembly Steps:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 15 (yellow bottom base)\n    Step2: Move block with index 1 (red curved block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 15 (yellow top block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 15 (yellow bottom base for second structure)\n    Step5: Move block with index 8 (solid red block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 7 (blue block)\n    Step7: Move block with index 12 (green block)\n    Step8: Move block with index 15 (yellow top block)\n}",

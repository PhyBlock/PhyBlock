A vehicle/train-like structure on the left\n  2. An arch-like structure on the right\n- Dominant colors: Orange, yellow, green, blue, red\n\nBlock Dictionary Selection:\nBased on the target image, I'll list the required block indices:\n\nVehicle/Train Structure (left):\n- Green block (index 5)\n- Blue block (index 2)\n- Red block (index 4)\n- Yellow blocks (indices 7 and 10)\n- Orange cylindrical blocks (indices 9 and 8)\n\nArch Structure (right):\n- Red arch block (index 1)\n- Yellow blocks (indices 7 and 11)\n- Orange cylindrical blocks (indices 8 and 3)\n- Orange triangular block (index 16)\n\nAssembly Order:\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder)\nStep2: Move block with index 3 (orange cube)\nStep3: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\nStep4: Move block with index 7 (yellow block)\nStep5: Move block with index 11 (yellow block)\nStep6: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle)\nStep7: Move block with index 9 (orange cylinder)\nStep8: Move block with index 8 (orange cylinder)\nStep9: Move block with index 2 (blue cube)\nStep10: Move block with index 5 (green block)\nStep11: Move block with index 4 (red cube)\nStep12: Move block with index 7 (yellow block)\nStep13: Move block with index 10 (yellow curved block)\n}",

Two orange cylindrical blocks placed side by side\n  2. One yellow rectangular block placed horizontally on top of the orange cylinders\n\nBlock Dictionary Selection:\n- Orange Cylindrical Blocks: From dictionary, use indices 7 and 8\n- Yellow Rectangular Block: From dictionary, use index 1\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 8 next to block 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 on top of blocks 7 and 8\n}\n\nKey Points:\n- Exact matching of block shapes and orientations\n- Used dictionary blocks without rotation\n- Followed step-by-step assembly format\n- Captured the spatial relationships in the target image\n\nThe solution precisely recreates the structure using the provided building block dictionary.",

Bottom Layer: 2x Green Cubes (Block 2 and Block 6)\n2. Second Layer: 1x Orange Cube (Block 9)\n3. Third Layer: 2x Blue Cubes (Block 1 and Block 7)\n4. Top Layer: 1x Orange Triangular Block (Block 12)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 9 (on top of green blocks)\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 7 (next to blue block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 12 (on top of blue blocks)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows the structure shown in the target image, using the exact blocks from the dictionary.",

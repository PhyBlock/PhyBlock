Target Structure Analysis:\n- Total blocks: 6 blocks\n- Colors: Green, Red, Blue, Orange\n- Layers: 3 layers\n- Unique spatial configuration with curved red blocks and triangular orange block\n\n2. Required Blocks from Dictionary:\n- Block 1 (red curved block): Used multiple times\n- Block 4 (blue cube): Used once\n- Block 5 (green cube/rectangular block): Used once\n- Block 14 (orange triangular block): Used once\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step2: Move block with index 5 (green cube)\n    Step3: Move block with index 1 (red curved block)\n    Step4: Move block with index 1 (another red curved block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 1 (third red curved block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular block)\n}\n\nThis sequence matches the target structure's color placement, block types, and overall spatial arrangement.",

Analyzing the Main Target Image:\n- The structure consists of two distinct block configurations\n- Left structure (colors: orange, green, blue, red):\n  * 5 blocks total\n  * 3 layers high\n  * Uses arch/curved blocks as base\n- Right structure (colors: red, yellow):\n  * 4 blocks total\n  * 3 layers high\n  * Also uses arch/curved blocks as base\n\n2. Block Selection from Dictionary:\nRequired blocks (by index):\n- Left structure:\n  * Block 10 (orange cylinder)\n  * Block 6 (green rectangular block)\n  * Block 3 (blue cube)\n  * Block 1 (red arch block)\n  * Block 14 (orange triangular block)\n\n- Right structure:\n  * Block 1 (red arch block) x2\n  * Block 5 (yellow cube)\n  * Block 7 (yellow rectangular block)\n\n3. Assembly Order:\n{\n  Step1: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n  Step2: Move block with index 10 (orange cylinder)\n  Step3: Move block with index 6 (green block)\n  Step4: Move block with index 3 (blue cube)\n  Step5: Move block with index 14 (orange triangle)\n  Step6: Move block with index 1 (red arch)\n  Step7: Move block with index 7 (yellow rectangle)\n  Step8: Move block with index 5 (yellow cube)\n}",

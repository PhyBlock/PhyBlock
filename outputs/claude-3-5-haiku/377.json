Target Image Analysis:\n- Total blocks: 10 blocks\n- Colors used: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange\n- Layers: Multiple (3-4 layers)\n- Structure: Two different configurations/structures\n\n2. Block Dictionary Selection:\nRequired Block Indices:\n- Red curved/arch blocks: 1, 2, 3\n- Blue cube: 4\n- Green rectangular block: 5, 6\n- Yellow curved/semi-circular blocks: 9, 10, 11, 12\n- Orange triangular/sloped blocks: 13, 14, 15, 16\n\n3. Assembly Instructions:\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 16 (orange triangle)\n    Step2: Move block with index 3 (red curved block)\n    Step3: Move block with index 4 (blue cube)\n    Step4: Move block with index 5 (green rectangular block)\n    Step5: Move block with index 6 (green rectangular block)\n    Step6: Move block with index 11 (yellow curved block)\n    Step7: Move block with index 12 (yellow curved block)\n    Step8: Move block with index 14 (orange triangular block)\n}\n\nThe assembly follows a complex spatial arrangement, carefully matching the block orientations and colors from the dictionary to recreate the target structures.",

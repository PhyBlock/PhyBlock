Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 3 blocks. It has two layers: a base layer and a top layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer is formed by 1 red arch shaped block.\n    *   The upper layer is made by two angled, orange blocks that meet at a central point above the arch. Each angled is mirrored and connected.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   One arch-shaped red block for the base.\n    *    Two angled orange blocks for the top that meet at the top.\n*   **List of Block Indices:**\n    *    1\n    *   11\n    *   12\n*    The block that represents the red arch shape is block index 1.\n*    The two orange blocks angled are 11 and 12.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis and selected blocks, here's the inferred assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\nThe assembly starts with block 1 and adds 11, and 12 on top of it.\n"

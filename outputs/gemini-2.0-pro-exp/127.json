It appears to have roughly four layers, considering the yellow block at the base as the first, the red semi-circle/orange rectangle as second, green rectangle as third, and the blue cubes as the fourth.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** A yellow rectangular block lies flat, forming the base.\n    *   **Second Layer:**  A red semi-circular block rests on top of the yellow block. An orange rectangular block lays to the right of the red semi-circular block. Two small orange triangular blocks are beside the orange rectangular block.\n    *    **Third layer** A green rectangular block is on top of the red semi-circular block.\n    *   **Fourth Layer:** Two blue cubes sit on top of the green rectangular block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Block 1: Red semi-circular block.\n*   Block 2: Blue cube (need two of these).\n*   Block 4: Yellow rectangular block.\n*    Block 6: Green rectangular block.\n*   Block 10: Orange Rectangular Block.\n*    Block 13: Orange triangular block.\n*    Block 14: Orange triangular block.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 10, 13, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 4\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 14\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n"

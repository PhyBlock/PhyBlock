It can be conceptually divided into three layers:\n    *   Bottom Layer: Four cylindrical orange blocks acting as legs.\n    *   Middle Layer: One long, flat, yellow rectangular block.\n    *   Top Layer: Consists of one orange cylinder (neck), One small, yellow, half-cylinder (head) and one triangular orange block (tail).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The four cylindrical blocks in the bottom layer are positioned at the corners, supporting the rectangular block above.\n    *   The rectangular block in the middle layer spans across the four cylindrical blocks.\n    *    One cylinder is standing up vertically on top of the middle layer, with one small half cylinder piece on top.\n    *   One triangular block sits at the other end of the middle layer.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Four orange cylinders: These must be oriented vertically. Block index 5 is the correct one.\n*   One long yellow rectangle: Block index 3.\n*   One orange triangular: Block index 15.\n*    One yellow half-cylinder: Block index 8\n*   One vertically oriented orange cylinder: Block index 5.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 15, 5, 8.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 5\nStep2: Move block with index 5\nStep3: Move block with index 5\nStep4: Move block with index 5\nStep5: Move block with index 3\nStep6: Move block with index 15\nStep7: Move block with index 5\nStep8: Move block with index 8\n}\n"

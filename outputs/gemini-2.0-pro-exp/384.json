Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** There are 14 blocks in total.\n*   **Layers:** The structure can be conceptually divided into three layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** Consists of four red arch-shaped blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Consist of 2 yellow rectangular blocks laying horizontally, 1 blue cube, 1 orange cube, and 1 green rectangular block standing vertically.\n    *   **Top Layer:** Consists of two yellow rectangular blocks standing vertically, 1 yellow half cylinder and 1 orange triangular prism.\n*    **Spatial Relationships:**\n    1. Four red arches form the foundation. Two arches are parallel to each other, with their open sides together, forming a tunnel, repeated twice, and placed next to each other.\n    2. On top of each tunnel, at its center, a yellow rectangular block laid horizontally.\n    3. Adjacent and on the right, a blue cube is placed on the left tunnel, and an orange cube on the right one, and then a green rectangular block standing vertically between them, on the border between two tunnels.\n    4. On top of the middle layer, two yellow rectangular blocks stand vertically, with a yellow half-cylinder sitting between them, and the orange triangular prism covers all.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks from the dictionary image:\n\n*   Block 1 (Red Arch): x4\n*   Block 6 (Blue Cube): x1\n*   Block 7 (Orange Cube): x1\n*   Block 8 (Green Rectangular Block): x1\n*   Block 9 (Yellow Rectangular Block): x2\n*   Block 12(Yellow Rectangular Block): x2\n*   Block 14(Yellow half cylinder): x1\n*   Block 16(Orange triangular prism): x1\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 12, 12, 14, 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 8\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n    Step11: Move block with index 12\n    Step12: Move block with index 14\n    Step13: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

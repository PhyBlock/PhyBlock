Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure appears to be composed of 15 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure can be conceptually divided into roughly three layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** Consists of the red arches, yellow arches and supporting blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Includes the orange/red cylinders, blue cube, green block, and yellow blocks.\n    *     **Top Layer:** features an orange roof.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *    There is a set of three blocks to the left and another on the right.\n    *   Left side:\n        *    Two yellow rectangular blocks form the base.\n        *    Two orange cylinders stand vertically on the yellow blocks.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the cylinders.\n        *   A Red Arch is placed on top of that.\n        *   An orange roof is on top of the arch.\n    *   Right Side.\n        *   Two red arches form the base.\n        *   A yellow arch sits centered on top of the red arches.\n        *   To the left side of the yellow arch is a blue cube.\n        *   To the right of the yellow arch, is a green rectangular block and two yellow rectangular blocks stacked on top of each other.\n        *   To the furthest right is an orange cube sitting on one of the red arches.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **1:** Used two times (red arches)\n*   **4:** Used one time (blue cube)\n*  **5:** Used one time. (Orange cube)\n*   **6:** Used one time (green rectangular block)\n*   **7:** Used three times (yellow rectangular block)\n*   **8:** used one time. (yellow square block)\n*    **9:** used one time. (yellow square block)\n*   **10:** Used two times (orange cylinder)\n*   **12:** Used one time (yellow arch)\n*   **14:** Used one time (orange roof)\n*    **15:** used one time.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 1\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n    Step11: Move block with index 4\n    Step12: Move block with index 6\n    Step13: Move block with index 8\n    Step14: Move block with index 9\n    Step15: Move block with index 5\n}\n```\n"

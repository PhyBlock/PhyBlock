Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures. Let's analyze them separately:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 6 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Two cylindrical blocks stand vertically, side-by-side.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A long, flat, rectangular block spans horizontally across the top of the two cylinders.\n    *   **Layer 3:** Two cuboid are put on the Layer 2, and a roof block is on the top.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*    **Count & Layers:** This structure is more complex, and have 6 block and 3 layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n*       **Layer 1:** Two arch, and put in parallel.\n*       **Layer 2:** Two long, flat, rectangular block spans horizontally and place on the arch of layer 1. A small cuboid is put at the right most of these two blocks.\n*       **Layer 3**: A roof block is put on layer 2.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are the required block indices:\n**Structure 1**\n*   Layer 1: Two orange cylinders (Index 11, need two)\n*   Layer 2: A yellow, rectangular block (Index 10)\n*   Layer 3: One red cuboid(Index 6), one blue cuboid (Index 8), and one roof(Index 15)\n\n**Structure 2**\n*   Layer 1: Two red arch (Index 2, need two)\n*    Layer 2: Two yellow rectangular block (Index 9, need two), one red cuboid (Index 6)\n*    Layer 3: One roof (Index 14)\n\n**Combined Block Indices List:** 11, 11, 10, 6, 8, 15, 2, 2, 9, 9, 6, 14.\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\nHere is step-by-step instructions to move.\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 6\n    Step12: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

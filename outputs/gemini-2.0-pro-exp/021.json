There are conceptually three layers:\n    *   Base Layer: Two red arch-shaped blocks.\n    *   Middle Layer: A yellow rectangular block, and a green cube.\n    *   Top Layer: A green cube, a blue rectangular block, and an orange triangular prism.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two red arch-shaped blocks form the base, positioned parallel to each other with a gap in between.\n    *   The yellow rectangular block spans the gap between the two red arches, resting on top of them.\n    * One green cube is on the yellow rectangular block.\n    * The next green cube is on top of the previous green cube.\n    *   The blue rectangular block rests on top of the second green cube.\n    *   The orange triangular prism rests on top of the blue block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required:\n\n*   Two red arch-shaped blocks: Block index 1 (used twice)\n*   One yellow rectangular block: Block index 10\n*   Two green cube: Block index 6 (used twice)\n*   One blue rectangular block: Block index 8\n*   One orange triangular prism: Block index 14\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 10, 6, 6, 8, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

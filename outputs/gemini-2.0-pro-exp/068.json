Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 6 blocks. It has 3 layers.\n    *   Bottom Layer: Three triangular prism blocks.\n    *   Middle Layer: One cuboid block.\n    *    Top Layer: Two triangular prism blocks forming a roof.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two orange triangular prism blocks are on the bottom layer, positioned at opposite ends of the structure (front-right and back-left).\n    *   One orange triangular prism sits directly next to and between the two mentioned blocks.\n    *   One green cuboid block sits directly on top and spans across two bottom triangular blocks.\n    *   Two orange triangular blocks forms the top, acting as the roof.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **2:** (Green Cuboid)\n*   **10:** (Orange triangular prism): 2 Qty\n* **12:** (Orange triangular prism): 1 Qty\n*   **14** (Orange triangular prism): 2 Qty\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Assembly:**\n1.  Place the orange triangular block (index 12).\n2.  Place another triangular block (index 14) forming the left base.\n3.  Place another triangular block (index 14) forming the right base.\n4.  Place the green cuboid block (index 2) on top.\n5.  Place the orange triangular block (index 10) next to green cuboid.\n6.  Place the last orange triangular block (index 10) forming the roof.\n"

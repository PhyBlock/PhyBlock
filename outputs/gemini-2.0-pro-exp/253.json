Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:**\n    *   The structure consists of two distinct parts.\n    *    The larger, main part contains 10 blocks.\n        It has up to three visible layers. The bottom has 3.\n    * The separate, smaller struture consists of two blocks.\n    *  It will appear to be one layer, but 2 are used.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n\n    *   **Main Structure:**\n        *   **Base Layer:** Three blocks form the base: two orange triangular prisms on either end, and a red arch block in the center.\n        *   **Second Layer:** Four blocks. Two yellow cubes form that back edge. A red arch and a green cube are also present.\n        *   **Third Layer:** A blue cube sits atop the green cube and red arch. Two orange, triangular prisms are arranged to make a pyramid.\n        *\n\n    *   **Smaller Structure:**\n         * Base layer: one red arch block.\n         * Layer Two: One orange, triangular prism.\n\n## 2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are needed:\n\n*   **Red Arch Blocks:** 1 (need two), 2\n*    **Orange Triangular Prisms:** 12 (need two),16 (need one), 13(need two)\n*   **Yellow Cubes:** 9 (need two)\n*   **Green Cube:** 8\n*   **Blue Cube:** 7\n\n## 3. Determine the Assembly Order:\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n    Step11: Move block with index 1\n    Step12: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

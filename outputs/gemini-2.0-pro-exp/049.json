Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks. It appears to have three layers:\n    *   Bottom Layer: One green rectangular block lying flat.\n    *   Middle Layer: Two yellow rectangular blocks standing vertically, and one smaller red cube.\n    *   Top Layer: One green rectangular block lying flat, mirroring the bottom layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom green block serves as the base.\n    *   The two yellow blocks are placed vertically on top of the base, side-by-side, creating a gap between them.\n    *    The red cube is fit into the space that is left from the base of the green rectangle, and at the sides of the two yellow ones.\n    *   The top green block sits atop the two yellow blocks, closing the structure.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, these are the required blocks:\n\n*   **Bottom Layer:** One green rectangular block lying flat: Block index **6**\n*   **Middle Layer:**\n    *   Two yellow rectangular blocks standing vertically: Block indices **13**, **14**\n    *  One small red cube: Block indices **4**\n* **Top Layer:** One green rectangular block lying flat: Block index **6**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 6, 13, 14, 4, 6\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n"

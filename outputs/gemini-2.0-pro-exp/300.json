            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the building process.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures: a vehicle (likely a truck or train car) and a small building resembling a house with pillars. Let's break down each:\n\n**Vehicle:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The vehicle is composed of 8 blocks. It essentially has two main layers: a base layer with cylindrical wheels and a rectangular body, and a top layer with more rectangular and curved blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two orange cylinders (wheels) are on the bottom, spaced apart.\n    *   A long green rectangular block sits on top of these cylinders.\n    *   A blue rectangular block is on top of the green one.\n    *    A yellow rectangular block is to the side of the blue block, on top of the green.\n    *   Two yellow quarter-cylinder/arch shapes are on top of the blue and yellow blocks.\n    * A red rectangular block stands vertically to one side of the vehicle.\n\n**House Structure:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The house structure uses 7 blocks. It has three main layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two orange cylinders (pillars) stand upright, spaced apart.\n    *   A red arch connects the two cylinders at the bottom.\n    *   A flat green rectangular block sits on top of the arch.\n    *    A blue cube sits on the green.\n    *   An orange triangular prism (roof) sits on top of the blue cube.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Vehicle:**\n    *   Orange Cylinders (Wheels): 12, 12\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Base): 6\n    *   Blue Rectangular Block: 4\n    *   Yellow rectangular block: 8\n    *   Yellow Arches: 13, 13\n    *   red rectangular block: 5\n\n*   **House:**\n    *   Orange Cylinders (Pillars): 10, 10\n    *   Red Arch: 1\n    *   Green Rectangular Block: 6\n    *   Blue Cube: 4\n    *   Orange Triangular Prism (Roof): 16\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n    Step8: Move block with index 5\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 1\n    Step12: Move block with index 6\n    Step13: Move block with index 4\n    Step14: Move block with index 16\n}\n"

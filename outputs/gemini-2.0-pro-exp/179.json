Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze the taller, primary structure first:\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The primary structure appears to have 4 layers, if we consider the bottom-most yellow block as the base layer. There are a total of 7 blocks in this structure.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** A single, horizontally-oriented yellow rectangular block.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically, side-by-side, on top of the yellow block.\n    *   **Layer 3:** A single, horizontally-oriented yellow rectangular block, identical to the base, placed on top of the two cylinders.\n    *   **Layer 4:** Two blue cubical blocks, side-by-side on the yellow block, with space between them. An arch block is on top of these two blocks, forming the top.\n\nThe second, smaller structure.\n*    **Count & Layers:** Single layer, 3 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   A slanted orange block is on the right\n    *   A blue block is in the middle.\n    *   A slanted orange block is on the left.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Primary Structure:**\n    *   Yellow Horizontal Rectangular Block: Index 8 (x2)\n    *   Orange Cylindrical Block: Index 9 (x2)\n    *   Blue Cubical Block: Index 4 (x2)\n    *   Red Arch Block: Index 1 (x1)\n\n*   **Second Structure:**\n    *    Orange Slanted Block: Index 12 (x1)\n    *   Blue Square Block: Index 4 (x1)\n    *\tOrange Slanted Block: Index 16 (x1)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Primary Structure:**\n\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n\n}\n\n**Second Structure**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 16\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n}\n"

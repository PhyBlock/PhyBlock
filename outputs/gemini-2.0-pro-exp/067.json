Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 4 blocks. It has two layers:\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** A red arch-shaped block.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two yellow half-cylinder blocks are resting on top of the red arch, and one orange roof block is on top of the yellow blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The red arch block forms the base of the structure.\n    *    The two yellow blocks are placed side by side, on top of the flat portions, curve to curve, of the arch.\n    *   The Orange roof block is place on top of the two yellow blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   One red arch block.\n    *   Two yellow half-cylinder blocks\n    *  One orange roof block\n*   **List of Block Indices:**\n    *   1\n    *   7\n    *   7\n    *   15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on my analysis of the images and selected blocks, the assembly instructions are:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

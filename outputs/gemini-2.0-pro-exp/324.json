Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 5 blocks and has one layer, meaning all blocks are on the ground.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There is a central green cube.\n    *   Four orange triangular prisms surround the green cube, each touching one of its sides. Two of the orange blocks form a mirrored pair, and so do the other two.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure is made of 6 blocks, assembled in 3 layers.\n*    **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Layer 1: A red arch block.\n    *   Layer 2: A horizontally-placed rectangular green block on top of the red arch.\n    * Layer 3: A yellow horizontal rectangular block is directly on top of the green block.\n    * Layer 4. Two orange triangular prisms, which form a mirrored pair, place on each side of the yellow block.\n    * Layer 5: An orange cylinder stands vertically atop the center of the yellow block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 3 (Green Cube)\n    *   Block 12 (Orange Triangle Prism) x 2\n    *   Block 16 (Orange Triangle Prism) x 2\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 1 (Red Arch)\n    *   Block 6 (Green Rectangular Block)\n    *   Block 8 (Yellow Rectangular Block)\n    *   Block 9 (Orange Cylinder)\n    *   Block 13 (Orange triangle Prism) x 2\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 3\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 16\n    Step5: Move block with index 16\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 13\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n    Step11: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n"

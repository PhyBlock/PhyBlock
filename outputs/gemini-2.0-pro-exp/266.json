Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of two separate assemblies. The first (left) assembly has 6 blocks across two layers. The second (right) assembly has 5 blocks across two layers. Thus 11 blocks total.\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Left Assembly):**\n    *   The bottom layer has a blue cube and an \"arch\" shape.\n    *   The second layer contains yellow block, green block and red block.\n    *   The top layer has an orange triangle-shaped block.\n*    **Spatial Relationships (Right Assembly):**\n    *   Bottom Layer: Two red arch pieces, one rotated 180 degree to the other along the y-axis(long axis).\n    *   Middle Layer: Yellow rectangular block\n    *    Top Layer: Two more red arches like these in the base.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **Left assembly:**\n    *   1 x Block 6 (Blue Cube)\n    *   1 x Block 5 (Red Arch)\n    *   1 x Block 10 (Yellow Rectangular block, horizontal)\n    *   1 x Block 7 (Green Cube)\n    *    1 x Block 8 (Red Cube)\n    *    1 x Block 15 (Orange triangle)\n\n*    **Right Assembly**\n    *   2 x Block 1 (Red Arch)\n    *   2 x Block 4 (Red Arch)\n    *   1 x Block 9 (Yellow Rectangular)\n\n**Total required blocks indices list is: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15.**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 1\n    Step11: Move block with index 4\n\n}\n```\n"

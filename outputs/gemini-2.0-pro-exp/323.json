            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target structure consists of two separate constructions:\n\n**Construction 1 (Left Side):**\n\n*   **Layers:** This structure has three layers.\n*   **Blocks & Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** Two red arch-shaped blocks (like upside-down \"U\"s) are placed parallel to each other, with some space between them.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** A long, flat, yellow rectangular block rests on top of the two red arches, bridging the gap.\n    * **Top Layer.** Two green cubes are placed on the yellow block. Followed by one blue horizontal rectangular and one orange horizontal rectangular on top of the green ones.\n\n**Construction 2 (Right Side):**\n\n*   **Layers:** This structure has three layers.\n*   **Blocks & Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** A long, flat, yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Two orange cylindrical blocks stand upright on the yellow block, spaced apart.\n    *   **Top Layer:** A red arch bridges between the two orange columns. An orange horizontal rectangular is place on top of the red arch.\n\n*   **Total Blocks:** The whole structure uses 4(construction 1)+7(construction 2)= 11 blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   **Construction 1**\n    *   Block 1 (Red arch): x2\n    *   Block 10 (Yellow rectangular, horizontal): x1\n    *   Block 6 (Green cube): x2\n    *   Block 9 (Blue horizontal rectangular):x1\n    *   Block 13 (Orange horizontal rectangular): x1\n\n*   **Construction 2**\n    *   Block 10 (Yellow rectangular, horizontal): x1\n    *   Block 12 (Orange cylinder): x2\n    *   Block 2(Red arch): x1\n    *    Block 14 (Orange horizontal rectangular): x1\n\n*   **List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 10, 6, 6, 9, 13, 10, 12, 12, 2, 14.\n\n**3. Determination of the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 6\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n    Step11: Move block with index 2\n    Step12: Move block with index 14\n\n}\n```\n"

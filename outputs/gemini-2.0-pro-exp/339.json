            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the target image, the required blocks, and the assembly instructions:\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 10 blocks. It can be conceptually divided into two parts:\n    *   A \"tower\" structure on the left which consists of 4 blocks that are stacked, creating 4 layers.\n    *   A \"vehicle-like\" structure on the right with a more complex layered arrangement. The base layer has 2 blocks, the next 2, then one, then one, for a total of 6 blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Tower:**\n        *   A red arch block forms the base.\n        *   A green rectangular block rests on top of the red arch.\n        *   A blue cube is stacked on the green block.\n        *   An orange triangular prism sits on top of the blue cube.\n    * **Vehicle:**\n        * There are two orange cylinder blocks at the base, on their sides, arranged horizontally and parallel to each other.\n        * A yellow block rests across the two orange cylinders.\n        * A yellow semi-circle rests on top of the flat portion of the yellow rectangle.\n        * A blue block rests on the back of the yellow rectangle.\n        *   An orange cylinder is standing vertically on the ground in-between the tower and the vehicle.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are needed:\n\n*   **Tower:**\n    *   1 (Red Arch)\n    *   7 (Green Rectangular Block)\n    *   4 (Blue Cube)\n    *   16 (Orange Triangular Prism)\n\n*   **Vehicle:**\n    *   10 (Orange Cylinder, used twice)\n    *    8 (Yellow rectangle)\n    *    12 (Yellow semi-circle)\n    *   4 (Blue Cube)\n\n*    **Vertical Cylinder:**\n    *  9 (orange cylinder)\n\n**Total Block Indices:** 1, 7, 4, 16, 10, 10, 8, 12, 4, 9.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence, following the specified format:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\n"

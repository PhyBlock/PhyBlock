Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 11 blocks arranged in 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** A red arch block in the center. Two yellow square blocks, one to the direct left, and one to the direct right. There are also two triangular orange wedge blocks. One is on the far left, and the other is on the far right.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** One blue and one green block sit on top of the red arch block.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** Three orange wedge blocks, and an orange cube on top of the middle layer blocks. One in front, and one in back, of the square blocks from Layer 2.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Block 1 (Red Arch)\n*   Block 9: (2) Yellow\n*   Block 6: (1) Blue\n*    Block 7: (1) Green\n*    Block 8: (1) Orange\n*   Block 14: (2) Orange, wedge, face right\n*   Block 16: (2) Orange, wedge, face left\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 16\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 16\n    Step10: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of two distinct assemblies.\n    *   **Assembly 1:** Has 8 blocks, and appears to be 5 layers high (if we consider each cylinder segment a layer, and including the base and arch).\n    *    **Assembly 2:** Is made up of 5 blocks. It seems to be 3 layers tall.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Assembly 1:**\n        *   Two cylindrical blocks form the base.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block lays flat on top of the base cylinders.\n        *   A blue cube sits centered on the yellow block.\n        *   A red arch sits centered on the yellow block, and to the left of the blue cube.\n        *   A vertical orange cylinder sits on top of the yellow rectangle.\n        *  A red horizontal rectanglar prism sits atop the orange cylinder.\n        *   An orange cylinder is placed vertically, on top of the red prism.\n        *   An orange triangular prism sits at the top.\n\n    *   **Assembly 2:**\n        *   Two green, vertical rectangular blocks are placed parallel to each other.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally, as the base under the green blocks.\n        *  A red rectanglar block is placed directly above the bottom yellow one, surrounded by the vertical green blocks.\n        *   A blue rectanglar block is placed directly below the top yellow one, and on top of the red block.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block bridges the top of the two green blocks, horizontally.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Assembly 1**\n    *   13 (Orange Cylinder) x 2\n    *   10 (Yellow Rectangular Prism - Horizontal)\n    *   4 (Blue Cube)\n    * 1(Red Arch)\n    *   13 (Orange Cylinder)\n    * 2 (Red Rectangular Prism)\n    *   14 (Orange Triangular Prism)\n* **Assembly 2**\n    *  7 (Green rectangular block) x 2\n    * 9 (yellow rectangular block) x 2\n    * 2 (red rectangular block)\n    * 8 (blue rectangular block)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14. Note that some indices will be used multiple times.\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 13\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n    Step12: Move block with index 7\n    Step13: Move block with index 2\n    Step14: Move block with index 8\n    Step15: Move block with index 9\n\n}\n```\n"

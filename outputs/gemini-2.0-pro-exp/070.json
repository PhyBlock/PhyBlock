It has two layers: a base layer of three blocks and a top layer of two blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** Two red \"arch\" blocks form the ends, connected by a yellow rectangular block horizontally.\n    * **Top Layer:**. Two red arch blocks form the top, and their direction is perpendicular to the red arch blocks in base layer.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need:\n\n*   Four red \"arch\" blocks. Looking at the dictionary, and paying close attention to the orientation, we must choose block index **2**.\n*    One yellow rectanglar block. Looking at the dictionary, we must choose block index **10**.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 2, 2, 2, 2, 10.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n\n}\n```\nExplanation of steps.\n1. Place the first arch.\n2. Place the yellow block to connect.\n3. Place another arch to complete the base.\n4. Place one arch on top.\n5. Place the final arch on top.\n"

Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of two distinct parts.\n    *   The larger structure on the left appears to have three layers, with a base layer of two red arched blocks, a second of mixed rectangular and square shapes, and a top layer including blue and orange blocks.\n    *    The smaller structure to the right has two layers, The base layer is a yellow cylinder, the second layer is the green block, and the top layer is the orange cylinder.\n    *   Total Blocks: The full construction appears to use 10 blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:**\n        *   Base: Two red arch-shaped blocks side-by-side, forming a wider base.\n        *   Second Layer: A yellow rectangular block spans the two red arches, followed by two green cubes, and finally a blue cube stacked above one of the green cubes.\n        *   Top Layer:An orange roof/triangular prism block sits atop the blue cube.\n\n    *   **Right Structure:**\n        *   Base: A yellow Cylinder\n        *    Second layer:A green block standing vertically.\n        *    Top Layer: An orange cylinder is on the green block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required:\n\n*   **1:** Two instances. (Red arched blocks)\n*   **2:** One instance. (Blue cube)\n*   **3:** Two instances. (Green cubes)\n*   **6:** One instance. (Yellow rectangular block, horizontal)\n*   **9:** One instance. (Orange cylinder, horizonal)\n*  **10:** One instance. (Yellow cylinder)\n*   **5:** one instance. (Green block)\n*   **15:** One instance (Orange triangle)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 3\n    Step6: Move block with index 2\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 5\n    Step10: Move block with index 9\n\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks. It has two layers. The bottom layer has 3 blocks, and the top has 2.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** Two yellow rectangular blocks are laid horizontally, parallel, and separate from each other. There is some space between them.\n    *   **Top Layer:** Two green rectangular blocks stand vertically on top of the yellow ones. Each green block is positioned roughly above the center of each yellow block. There are two yellow blocks in the base, also.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need:\n\n*   Two yellow, horizontal rectangular blocks.\n*    Two Green, vertical rectangular blocks.\n* Two yellow, horizontal rectangular blocks.\n\nLooking at the Block Dictionary Image, the required block indices are:\n\n*   Yellow, horizontal rectangle: 7 (We'll need two of these.)\n*   Green, vertical rectangle: 3 (We'll need two of these.)\n* Yellow, horizontal rectangle: 11\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 7, 11, 3, 3, 7\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n}\n```\nThe steps ensure placing the yellow base first, then put two green ones on the top.\n"

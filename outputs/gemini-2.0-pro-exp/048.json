Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of four blocks. It has two layers: a base layer and a top layer.  The middle layer consists of two blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer is a single, horizontally-placed, green rectangular block.\n    *   The second layer is formed by two yellow, vertically placed, rectangular blocks on the base green block.\n    *   The third layer consists of a single green, horizontally-placed, rectangular block on top. The shape is the same as the block from the base.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need:\n\n*   Two horizontally-placed green rectangular blocks.\n*   Two vertically-placed yellow rectangular blocks.\n\nLooking at the Block Dictionary Image, the following indices match:\n\n*   Horizontal green rectangular block: Index 1 (we need two of these)\n*   Vertical yellow rectangular blocks: Index 9 (we need two of these)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 9, 9\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is inferred by building the structure from the ground up, layer by layer.\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 9\nStep3: Move block with index 9\nStep4: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n"

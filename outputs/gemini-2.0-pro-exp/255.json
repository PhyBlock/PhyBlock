            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The target image shows two separate structures. The structure on the left uses 3 blocks to create a vertical stack. The right one also comprises 3 blocks.  This creates a structure that has an overall height (or \"layers\" if considering a vertical build) of three blocks for the left structure, and seemingly one layer of blocks for the right structure.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Structure:** A red \"C\" shaped block forms the base and the top. A green rectangular block and a blue retangular block are sandwiched, side by side, in between the two red blocks.\n    *   **Right Structure:** A red \"C\" shaped block forms the base. Two blue rectangular blocks go through the hole of the red block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   **Left Structure:**\n    *   Two Red \"C\" shaped blocks, oriented vertically, opening to the right. (Block index 8, need two)\n    *   One Green Rectangular blocks. (Block Index 10)\n    *    One Blue Rectangular blocks. (Block Index 9)\n* **Right Structure**\n    *    One Red \"C\" shaped blocks, oriented vertically, opening to the right. (Block index 8)\n    *    Two Blue Rectangular blocks. (Block index 9, need two)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 8, 8, 10, 9, 8, 9, 9\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n1. set one red C-block (8).\n2. Insert the green block (10) into C-block.\n3. Insert the blue block (9) next to block 10.\n4. Cover the blocks with another red C-block (8)\n5. Set another red C block (8) for the second structure.\n6.  Insert one blue block (9) into the hole of the red block.\n7. Insert another blue block (9) into the hole of the red block, next to the first one.\n"

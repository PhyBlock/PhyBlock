Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks, arranged in 2 layers.\n*    **Layer 1:** The First Layer are all Red color.\n*.   **Layer 2:** The Second Layer has one yellow block and two blocks form a small bridge.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There are two separate structures.\n    *   The smaller structure uses three block. Two red blocks, one red arch is at the bottom, with one Square on top of it with two blue, one yellow split colors.\n    *.  The big structure include four blocks, two Red Arches and two Yellow blocks.\n    *.   The layer 1 contains two separate \"arch\" blocks.\n    *   The Layer 2 has two \"rectangle\" shape yellow blocks positioned horizontally on top of, and connecting, the two arch blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Red Arch:** Index 1 (3 times)\n*   **Yellow Rectangle:** Index 15 (2 times)\n*    **Yellow Square.** Index 11\n*    **Blue Square.** Index 7\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n    {\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    }\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure appears to be composed of 13 blocks. There are primarily two layers: a base layer and blocks placed on top of the base.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There's a base layer of 4 orange cylinders.\n    *   There are 2 red arched at the left.\n    *   There are three long yellow blocks sitting across the orange cylinders.\n    *   There are three long green blocks on the red arched blocks.\n    *   There is a yellow cylinder, which is perpendicular to the three long yellow blocks, stacked on the left two long yellow blocks.\n    *   There is a yellow half cylinder on the top.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, these are the required block indices:\n\n*   Orange Cylinders (x4): 12, 12, 12, 12\n*   Red arched blocks (x2): 1, 1\n*   Yellow long blocks (x3): 11, 11, 11\n*   Green long blocks (x3): 4, 4, 4\n*   Yellow cylinder (x1): 10\n*   Yellow half cylinder (x1) :14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 11\n    Step9: Move block with index 11\n    Step10: Move block with index 4\n    Step11: Move block with index 4\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 10\n    Step14: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

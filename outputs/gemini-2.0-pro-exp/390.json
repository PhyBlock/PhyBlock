Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure appears to be composed of two main sub-assemblies.\n    *   The first assembly on the left consists of 5 blocks stacked vertically, creating what looks like a layered sandwich. It has 3 visible layers.\n    *    The second assembly features multiple components. Two cylinderical blocks are used as pillars. One yellow block is placed horizontally on top of these pillars. An arch is placed on this, and an inverted arch is placed on top of the yellow block. Finally, a triangular prism block is placed on one of the vertical cylinders.\n    *   So, in total, there are 11 blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Assembly:**\n        *   A red arch block at the base.\n        *   A green rectangular block.\n        *   A yellow arch\n        *    A green rectangle\n        *   A red arch block on top.\n    *   **Right Assembly:**\n        *    Two orange cylinder blocks are parallel to each other.\n        *   A yellow rectangular block bridges the two cylinders.\n        *    A red arch block on top of the yellow block.\n        *    A yellow inverted arch is on the yellow rectangle.\n        *    An orange triangle is placed on top of one of the cylinders.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are needed:\n\n*   **Left Assembly:**\n    *   1 (Red Arch)\n    *   4 (Green Rectangle)\n    *    11(yellow arch)\n    *    5(Green Rectangle)\n    *   2 (Red Arch)\n*   **Right Assembly:**\n    *   10 (Orange Cylinder) - Used twice\n    *   7 (Yellow Rectangle)\n    *    3 ( Red Arch)\n    *    13(yellow inverted arch)\n    *   14 (Orange Triangle)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 4, 11, 5, 2, 10, 10, 7, 3, 13, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 3\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n    Step11: Move block with index 14\n\n}\n```\n"

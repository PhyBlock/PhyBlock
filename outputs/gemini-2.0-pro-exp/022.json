Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks. It has three layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** Two red arch-shaped blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** A long yellow rectangular block, and two green cubical blocks, and one small blue cubical block.\n    *   **Top Layer:** One orange triangular prism.\n    *    One small blue cubical block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two red arch-shaped blocks form the base, positioned parallel to each other with a gap in between.\n    *   The yellow rectangular block spans across the two red arches, connecting them.\n    *   The two green blocks are on top of the yellow block. One small blue block is between the two green blocks.\n    *    The orange triangular prism sits atop the middle blue and one of green blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   Two red arch-shaped blocks: Index 1 (used twice)\n*   One yellow rectangular block: Index 11\n*   Two green cubical blocks: Index 5 (used twice)\n*    One small blue block: Index 8\n*   One orange triangular prism: Index 15\n*    One small blue block: Index 9\n\n**Block indices needed:** 1, 1, 11, 5, 5, 8,9,15.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 9\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

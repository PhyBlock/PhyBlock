Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Tall Structure):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 8 blocks and has 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two yellow rectangular blocks, placed horizontally and parallel to each other, with a gap between them.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two blocks perpendicular to layer 1. One red cube and one blue cube.\n    *    **Layer 3:** Two green rectangular blocks. Identical to Layer 1 in terms of orientation, block type.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top):** Two yellow rectangular blocks. Identical to Layer 1.\n\n**Structure 2 (Arched Structure):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure seems to be composed of 4 blocks and has what can be best described as 2-3 \"layers\" due to its arched nature.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * **Bottom layer:** One red arch.\n    * **Middle Layer:** One yellow half cylinder on top of the arch.\n    *   **Top Layer:** Two orange triangular prism to form a roof.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Yellow Rectangular Blocks (Horizontal): Index **9** (Four needed)\n*   Red Cube: Index **5** (One needed)\n*   Blue Cube: Index **3** (One needed)\n*    Green Rectangular Block(Vertical): Index **6** (Two needed)\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*    Red Arch: Index **1**\n*   Yellow Half Cylinder: Index **11**\n*   Orange Triangular Prism: Index **15** (Two needed)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 3, 6, 6, 1, 11, 15, 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n```\n{\n   Step1: Move block with index 9\n   Step2: Move block with index 9\n   Step3: Move block with index 5\n   Step4: Move block with index 3\n   Step5: Move block with index 6\n   Step6: Move block with index 6\n   Step7: Move block with index 9\n   Step8: Move block with index 9\n\n}\n```\n**Structure 2:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 15\n    Step4: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

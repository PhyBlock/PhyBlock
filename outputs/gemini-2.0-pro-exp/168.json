There appear to be conceptually three layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** Four cylindrical orange blocks, two red arched blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Two green rectangular blocks, one vertical yellow rectangular, one green squared block.\n    *   **Top Layer:** One orange triangular prism.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer has four orange cylinders grouped together as support. Two red arched blocks are located on the left base.\n    *   Two green rectangular blocks are placed horizontally on top of the four cylinders.\n    *   One green squared block and one yellow rectangular block are put vertically behind the red arch.\n    *  One orange triangle is on the top of the yellow block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   Orange Cylinders: 12 (used four times)\n*   Red Arches: 1 (used two times)\n*   Green Rectangular Blocks (horizontal): 4 (used two times)\n*   Green Squared Block (vertical): 6\n*   Yellow Rectangular Block (vertical): 10\n*   Orange Triangular Prism:13\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 12, 12, 12, 12, 1, 1, 4, 4, 6, 10, 13.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 4\n    Step8: Move block with index 4\n    Step9: Move block with index 6\n    Step10: Move block with index 10\n    Step11: Move block with index 13\n}\n"

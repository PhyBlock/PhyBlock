Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure is composed of two distinct parts: a \"chair-like\" structure on the left and a more complex structure on the right.\n    *   Chair: 4 blocks, seemingly 3 layers (base arch, then rectangle and semi-circle, then triangle)\n    *   Right Structure: 6 blocks, seemingly 3 layers (base: ramps and one vertical rectangular prism. Middle: cylinder. Top: triangular prism.)\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Chair:** A red arch forms the base.  A red rectangular block sits on top of the arch.  A yellow semi-circular block rests on the red rectangle.  An orange triangular prism sits on top of the red rectangle.\n    *   **Right Structure:** Two orange ramps are on either side of the base with vertical green prisms resting behind/against them. A tall orange cylinder is positioned in the center, supported/enclosed by the green prisms. The triangular prism caps the cylinder. The ramps are angled upwards away from the center.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Chair:**\n    *   1 (Red Arch)\n    *   11 (Red Rectangular block)\n    *   9 (Yellow Semi-circle)\n    *   12 (Orange Triangle)\n* **Right structure**\n    *   13 (orange ramp)\n    *   14 (orange ramp)\n    *    6 (green rectangle)\n    *    6 (green rectangle)\n    *    7 (orange cylinder)\n    *    12 (orange triangle)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 11, 9, 12, 13, 14, 6, 6, 7, 12.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n    Step8: Move block with index 6\n    Step9: Move block with index 7\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n\n}\n```\n"

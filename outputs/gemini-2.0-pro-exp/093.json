Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks. It appears to have multiple layers. We can define them as:\n    *   Base Layer: Two vertical green blocks.\n    *   Second Layer: One horizontal yellow block spanning the two green blocks.\n    *   Third layer: One horizontal yellow block and on top of it, one red and one blue block.\n    *   Top Layer: One Yellow half-cylinder block.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two green blocks form the base and are spaced apart.\n    *   One yellow block placed horizontally on top of two green blocks.\n    *   One yellow block placed horizontally, adjacent to red and blue blocks.\n    *    One red block is placed veritcally on the yellow block.\n    *   One blue block is place vertically on top of the red block.\n    *   One yellow half-cylinder block is placed on top of the blue block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two Green vertical rectangular blocks: Index 8 (appears twice)\n*   One Yellow horizontal rectangular block: Index 11\n*   One Yellow horizontal rectangular block: Index 11\n*   One Red vertical rectangular block: Index 4\n*   One Blue vertical rectangular block: Index 1\n*   One Yellow half-cylinder block: Index 13\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 8, 8, 11, 11, 4, 1, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the selected blocks and their spatial relationships, here's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

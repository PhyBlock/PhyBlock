Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks. It has multiple layers:\n    *   Base Layer: Two cylindrical orange blocks standing vertically.\n    *   Second Layer: One rectangular yellow block lying horizontally on top of the base cylinders.\n    *   Third Layer: One cylindrical orange block, standing vertically and on top of the front of the yellow horizontal block.\n    *    Forth Layer: One yellow half cylinder piece.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two base cylinders are parallel to each other and spaced apart.\n    *   The horizontal rectangular block bridges the gap between the two base cylinders, resting on top of both.\n    *   The third layer cyclinder sits at the front edge of the rectangle.\n    *   The half cylinder sits atop the final cylinder.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   7 (Orange Cylinder - Vertical) - Used twice for the base.\n    *   1 (Yellow rectangle - Horizontal)\n    *    7 (Orange Cylinder - Vertical)\n    *    10 (Yellow half Cylinder)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the assembly:**\n1.  Place a vertical orange cylinder.\n2. Place the other, creating the base.\n3.  Place the long horizontal rectangle on top of these.\n4. Place the final cylinder vertically.\n5. Top with the half cylinder.\n"

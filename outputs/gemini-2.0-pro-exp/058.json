Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks. It has 5 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom):** Two red arch-shaped blocks are placed next to each other.\n    *   **Layer 2:** One green rectangular block placed horizontally, bridging the two arches below.\n    *   **Layer 3:** One red arch is placed on top of the middle of the green rectangular block from layer 2.\n    *   **Layer 4:** Two green rectangular blocks are standing vertically on the arch from Layer 3.\n    *    **Layer 5 (Top):** One horizontally placed yellow rectangluar block, that is resting upon the two vertical green blocks and lastly, one orange triangular prism on top of the yellow rectangular block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks from the provided dictionary image:\n\n*   **Block Indices:** 1, 1, 7, 2, 5, 5, 10, 15.\n\n**Matching Criteria Justification:**\n\n*   Two instances of Block 1 are used for the base.\n*   Block 7: Green horizontal rectangular block.\n*   Block 2 is the red arch resting on block 7.\n*  Two instances of Block 5: Green vertical blocks, correct orientation, that are on top of block 2.\n* Block 10: Yellow block resting on top of both blocks 5.\n* Block 15 is the orange triangular prism.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 2\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 5\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

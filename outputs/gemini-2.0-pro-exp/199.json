Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure appears to have two primary layers, with some blocks extending slightly above, creating a partial third layer. There seem to be 16 blocks.\n*    **Spatial Relationships**:\n    1.  Three arch, in red color, are put side by side, forming part of layer one.\n    2.  There are two yellow blocks behind the red archs, which form part of layer one.\n    3. A green block is put on the middle red arch.\n    4.  Two blue blocks are stacked on the green one.\n    5.  There are one red, one green and two yellow blocks in layer one, in front of the archs.\n    6. A red half-cylinder is put on the yellow one in layer one, in front of the archs.\n    7. Two orange blocks are put at the end of layer one.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   Red arch: 1 (x3)\n*   Blue cube: 3 (x2)\n*   Green small rectangle: 5 (x1)\n*   Yellow rectangle: 8 (x3)\n*    Green rectangle: 6(x1)\n*    Red half-cylinder: 2(x1)\n*    Orange small block:11(x1)\n* Orange triangle: 15(x2)\n*Red small rectangle:13(x1)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\nHere is the step by step instruction.\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 5\n    Step11: Move block with index 3\n    Step12: Move block with index 3\n    Step13: Move block with index 11\n    Step14: Move block with index 15\n    Step15: Move block with index 15\n\n}\n```\n"

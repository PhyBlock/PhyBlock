Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks. It has three primary layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** Two red arch-shaped blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Two rectangular blocks (one yellow and one blue) and one blue cube.\n    *  **Top Layer**: One green rectanglar block, one small orange block, and one large orange block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two red arch-shaped blocks form the base, positioned parallel to each other with a gap in between.\n    *   The yellow rectangular block spans the two red arches.\n    *  The blue rectanglar block is on top of the yellow block.\n    *   The blue cube block sits atop the blue rectanglar block, positioned more towards the \"left\" end (from the given perspective).\n    *   The green block spans the blue block and a bit of the yellow block, and the green block is lower than the blue block.\n    * One small orange block is on top of the green block.\n    * One large orange block is on top of the green and blue block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are needed:\n\n*   **1:** (Red arch) - Used twice.\n*   **4:** (Blue cube)\n*   **7**: (Green rectangular)\n* **8**: (Yellow rectangular)\n* **11**: (Yellow rectangular)\n*   **12:** (Small orange block)\n* **15**: (Large orange block)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 1\nStep2: Move block with index 1\nStep3: Move block with index 8\nStep4: Move block with index 11\nStep5: Move block with index 4\nStep6: Move block with index 7\nStep7: Move block with index 12\nStep8: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

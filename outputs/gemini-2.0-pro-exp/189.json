Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count:** The structure uses 17 blocks.\n*   **Layers:** The structure can be considered to have multiple layers, built from the ground up:\n    *   Base Layer: Consists of arches, triangular prisms and half cylinder.\n    *   Second Layer: Rectangular prisms, cubes, and roofs on top of the blocks from the first layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   There are three red arch shapes forming the main base of the structure.\n    *   There are orange triangular prisms that sit at various points of the structure.\n    *   Cubes, Rectangular Prisms and roof pieces sit on top of other blocks.\n    *   Yellow half-cylinders are laying on their curved side.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required (remembering that blocks cannot be rotated):\n\n*   **1:** Three times (Three red arch)\n*   **4:** One time (One Blue Cube)\n*   **5:** One Time (One small green cube)\n*   **6:** One Time (One small orange cube)\n*   **7:** One Time (One green Rectangular Prism)\n*   **8:** One Time (One yellow Rectangular Prism)\n*   **9:** One Time (One yellow Rectangular Prism)\n*   **10:** One time (One Yellow Half-Cylinder)\n*   **11:** One time (One Yellow Half-Cylinder)\n*   **12:** One time (One Yellow Half-Cylinder)\n*  **13:** One time (One small orange triangular prism)\n*   **14:** Two times (Two orange triangular prisms)\n*   **15:** Two times (Two orange roof)\n* **16**: one time (One small orange triangular prism)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence, inferred from the spatial relationships and the base-upwards construction:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n    Step5: Move block with index 16\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 11\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 4\n    Step10: Move block with index 8\n    Step11: Move block with index 15\n    Step12: Move block with index 6\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n    Step14: Move block with index 15\n    Step15: Move block with index 5\n    Step16: Move block with index 7\n    Step17: Move block with index 14\n    Step18: Move block with index 14\n\n}\n```\n"

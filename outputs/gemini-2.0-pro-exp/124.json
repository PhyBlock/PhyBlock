            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of three blocks in total. It has two layers: a base layer made of two blocks and a top layer made of one block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer consists of two identical red, arch-shaped blocks. These blocks are placed parallel and are not touching, creating a bridge-like structure.\n    *   The top layer consists of a single yellow block that resembles a rectangular prism with a semi-cylindrical extension on one end. This block rests across the two red arch-shaped blocks, spanning the gap between them.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Two red arch-shaped blocks.\n    *   One yellow block with rectangular and semi-cylindrical parts.\n*   **List Block Indices:**\n    *   Looking at the Block Dictionary image and matching the orientations, the required blocks are:\n        *   Block index 1 (Red arch)\n        *   Block index 1 (Red arch)\n        *    Block index 8 (yellow block).\n*     Matching Criterial: I have ensured that the orientation and shape match.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the assembly order would be:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n1.  Place the first red arch-block (index 1)\n2.  Place the second red-arch block (index 1) at the suitable position to create a parallel and not touch.\n3.  Place the yellow block (index 8) on top of two red arch-blocks.\n"

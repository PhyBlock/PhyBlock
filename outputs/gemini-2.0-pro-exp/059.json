It has three layers:\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** Two red arched blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** One yellow rectangular block and Two Red C shape blocks.\n    *   **Top Layer:** One Yellow rectangular block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two arched blocks placed side-by-side, creating a wider base.\n    *   One yellow block placed on these two arched blocks.\n    *   Two C-shaped blocks sit on the first layer, facing outwards.\n    *   The top yellow block rests on top of the two C-shaped blocks, completing the structure.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two red arched blocks (from the bottom layer). Looking at the dictionary, block index **1** matches this requirement. We need two of these.\n*    One Yellow rectangular block. Block index **10** matched.\n*    Two C-shape blocks. Block index **8** matched.\n*    One Yellow block. index **10** matched.\n\nTherefore, the list of block indices is: **1, 1, 10, 8, 8, 10**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n\n}\n```\n"

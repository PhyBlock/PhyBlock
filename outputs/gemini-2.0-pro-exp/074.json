Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks. It has two main layers. The bottom layer acts as a base, and the top layer is built upon it.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** Two red arch-shaped blocks form the base, with their curved sides facing downwards. A yellow rectangular block spans across the top of these two arches, connecting them.\n    *    **Top Layer:** on top of that yellow block, at either end is an identical red arch. In between the arches, there is a triangular prism.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Four red arch blocks.\n    *   One yellow, horizontal rectangular block.\n    *    One Orange, triangular prism\n*   **List of Block Indices:**\n    1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 12\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks. It has two primary layers:\n    *   Bottom Layer: Two cylindrical orange blocks lying horizontally and parallel to each other.\n    *   Top Layer: One green rectangular block laid horizontally on top of the two orange cylinders, and two orange triangular prism-like structure, one placed on top of the cylinders and the back side of it placed vertically.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two orange cylinders are parallel and adjacent, forming the base.\n    *   The green rectangle sits centrally on top of both cylinders, spanning across them.\n    *   One orange block is placed centrally on the green block.\n    *   The other orange block is vertically stacked on top of the orange block on the green block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two orange cylinders lying on its side: Block index **6** (we'll need this twice)\n*   One green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation: Block index **2**\n*    One orange triangular prism with the hypotenuse facing down: Block index **14**\n*   One orange triangular prism: Block index **8**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 6, 6, 2, 14, 8\n\n**3. Determination of the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n}\n```\n"

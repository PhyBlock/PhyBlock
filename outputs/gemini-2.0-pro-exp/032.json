Analysis of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 4 blocks. It has two layers. The bottom layer has two blocks, the top has two.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two orange, vertically oriented cylindrical blocks. These are spaced apart, parallel to each other.\n    *   Resting on top of these two cylinders is a yellow, horizontally oriented rectangular block.\n    *  Resting on the yellow block is an orange, triangle.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Two orange cylinders, vertical orientation: Block index 6 (we'll need two of these)\n*    One Yellow rectangular block, horizontal: Block index 2.\n*   One orange triangle: Block index 13.\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 6, 6, 2, 13\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

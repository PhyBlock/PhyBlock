            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the images and provide the construction plan.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 5 blocks. It has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer has two yellow cuboids placed horizontally and parallelly, with a space between them.\n    *   The second layer has a combined set of a blue square at the bottom and a red square at the top. The combined block is placed vertically between the space of the two cuboids.\n    *    The third layer has a green cuboid and it is put vertically on the top of the squares.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 7 blocks. It appears to have 5 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer is a green square block.\n    *   The second layer consists of an orange cylinder, placed vertically on top of the base.\n    *   The third layer consists of an orange triangle.\n    *    The forth layer contains two green cuboids put vertically.\n    *   The fifth layer has a yellow block.\n    *   The sixth layer is combined of a blue block and a red triangle.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on my analysis, here are the block indices needed from the dictionary image:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*    Yellow Cuboid: 10, 10\n*   Blue and Red Square: 1\n*    Green Cuboid: 9\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Green Square: 2\n*   Orange Cylinder: 12\n*   Orange triangle: 16\n*    Green Cuboid: 9, 9\n*   Yellow block: 11\n*    Blue and red block: 1, 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence for both structures:\n**Structure 1:**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n}\n\n**Structure 2:**\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 16\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 9\n    Step6: Move block with index 11\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: move block with index 15\n\n}\n"

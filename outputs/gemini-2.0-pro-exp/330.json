Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 5 blocks arranged in 3 layers.\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): One cylindrical orange block.\n    *   Layer 2 (Middle): one rectangular yellow block.\n    *   Layer 3 (Top): one block with a triangular hole and two green side blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The orange cylinder is at the base.\n    *  The yellow rectangular block is on the top of the orange cylinder.\n    *  The block with a triangular hole is placed on the top of the rectangular yellow block, and two green blocks are beside the block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 4 blocks to make only 1 layer.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   one block with a circular hole and two green side blocks are placed between two yellow blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 10 (Orange Cylinder)\n    *   Block 9 (Yellow Rectangular block)\n    *   Block 14 (one orange block with triangular hole).\n    *   Block 5 (green block) x 2\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 8 (Yellow block) x 2\n    *  Block 2 (one red block with a circular hole)\n    *   Block 4 (one green block) x2\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n   **Structure 1:**\n\n    {\n    Step1: Move block with index 10\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 5\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    }\n\n   **Structure 2:**\n   {\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 4\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 4\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n   }\n"

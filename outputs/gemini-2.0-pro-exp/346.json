Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 4 blocks and has two layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer consists of two cylindrical orange blocks (standing vertically).\n    *   The top layer consists of one horizontal yellow rectangular block on top and between two cylinders.\n    *   One orange pyramid on the top of the yellow rectangular block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure has 6 blocks across three visible layers, though a partially obscured block on layer 1 adds complexity.\n* **Spatial Relationships:**\n    * A red block is placed at the bottom.\n    * A green rectangular block, is laid horizontally in the middle of the red block.\n    * A yellow rectangular block is placed horizontally on top of the green block.\n    * One cylinder and two pyramids, all colored in orange, are on top of the yellow block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the list of required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n*   Block 8 (Orange Cylinder, x2)\n*   Block 7 (Yellow Rectangular Block)\n*   Block 16 (Orange pyramid)\n\n**Structure 2:**\n*    Block 1 (Red block)\n*    Block 4 (Green rectangular block)\n*    Block 7 (Yellow Rectangular Block)\n*    Block 8 (Orange cylinder)\n*    Block 12 (Orange pyramid, x2)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere's the step-by-step assembly instruction:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 16\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 8\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n\n}\n```\n"

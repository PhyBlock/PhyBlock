Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of three blocks. It has two layers:\n    *   The bottom layer is a single red arch-shaped block.\n    *   The top layer consists of two square blocks, one blue and one yellow, placed side-by-side on top of the arch.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The red arch-shaped block forms the base.\n    *   The blue and yellow square blocks sit directly on top of the flat, upper surface of the red arch.\n    *   The blue square block is to the left, and the yellow is on its right. They are adjacent, and the blue one occupies the first half space and yellow the second half of the arch's top space.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, we need:\n    *   One red arch-shaped block.\n    *   One blue square block.\n    *   One yellow square block.\n*   **List of Block Indices:**\n    *   Red arch: Looking at the dictionary, the correct orientation is block index **2**.\n    *   Blue square: The blue square block is index **9**.\n    *   Yellow square: The yellow square block is index **13**.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the structure, the assembly order is straightforward:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1.  **Step 1:** Place the red arch (index 2) as the base.\n2.  **Step 2:** Place the blue square block (index 9) on the left side on the top of the arch.\n3.  **Step 3:** Place the yellow square block (index 13) on the right side of the arch next to the blue block.\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks. It can be conceptually divided into three layers:\n    *   Base Layer: Two long green blocks and a red arch.\n    *   Middle Layer: A green cube and a blue cube.\n    *   Top Layer: Two orange triangle/roof pieces, one on each side of each cubes.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two green base blocks are parallel and spaced to the left and right.\n    *   The red arch is between the two green base blocks.\n    *   The green cube sits centered on top of the left green base, and the left side of the arch.\n    *   The blue cube sits centered on top of the right base, and the right side of the arch.\n    *   One orange triangle is placed to the left of the green cube, and the other to the right of the blue one.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Two Green Rectangular Blocks (Horizontal orientation): Block index 11 (used twice).\n*   One Red Arch: Block index 2.\n*    One Green Cube: Block Index 8.\n*   One Blue Cube: Block Index 7.\n*   Two Orange triangle/roof: Block index 14 (twice).\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 11, 11, 2, 8, 7, 14, 14.\n\n**3. Determination of the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 14\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

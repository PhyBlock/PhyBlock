It has two layers: a base layer with two yellow half-cylinder blocks and an upper layer with a green cube and a blue cube.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two yellow half-cylinder blocks are in the bottom layer, side-by-side.\n    *   The blue cube is on top of the right yellow half-cylinder.\n    *   The green cube is on top of the left yellow half-cylinder, adjacent to the blue block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:** Based on the analysis, we need:\n    *   Two yellow half-cylinder lying on flat side.\n    *   One blue cube.\n    *   One green cube.\n\n*   **List Block Indices:**\n    *   Yellow half-cylinder: 6, 7\n    *   Blue Cube: 1\n    *   Green Cube: 2\n\n*    **Matching Criteria Justification:**\n    *    The selected shapes (half-cylinder and cubes) and Colors (yellow, blue and green) match between the provided image and dictionary.\n    *    The selected orientation of index 6 and 7 match the target image.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 2\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n"

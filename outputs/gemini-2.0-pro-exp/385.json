Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 9 blocks in total. It appears to be built across three primary layers.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Consists of four blocks: two vertical green blocks forming the base and on the right, and on the left are the two red arched blocks.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Middle):** two long horizontal yellow block rest on top of layer 1.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):** An orange cylinder, followed by another orange cylinder stacked on it, and then a yellow dome-shaped block on the top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two red arch-shaped blocks are separate, parallel and on oposite sides.\n    *    A yellow rectangular block bridges across the two green blocks on the right structure.\n    *    A yellow rectangular block sits between and on top of the two red arches in the structure on the left.\n    *   An orange cyclinder rests on the right yellow rectangualr block, and then a dome topped cyclinder sits on that cyclinder.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block 1:**  Red arch (x2)\n*   **Block 6:** Green rectangular block, vertical orientation (x2)\n*   **Block 8:** Yellow rectangular block, horizontal orientation (x2)\n*   **Block 10:** Orange cylinder, vertical. (x2)\n*  **Block 12:** Yellow dome. (x1)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 10\n    Step8: Move block with index 10\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n\n}\n```\n"

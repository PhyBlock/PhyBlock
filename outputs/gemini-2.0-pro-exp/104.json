Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 4 blocks. It has two main layers:\n    *   A base layer consisting of two cylindrical blocks.\n    *   A top layer, made of one rectangular block, and a cube sitting on the rectangular block.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two cylindrical blocks are parallel to each other, laying on the ground, with some space in between.\n    *    A yellow, horizontally oriented rectangular block is resting on the top of the cylindrical blocks.\n    *    The blue cube is on top of the rectangular block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Two orange, horizontal cylinder: Block indices 13 and 14. These are laid parallel.\n*   One yellow, horizontal rectangular block: Block index 10\n*   One blue cube: Block index 1\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 13, 14, 10, 1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 14\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n"

            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 6 blocks. There are conceptually two layers: a base layer and a top layer resting on the base.  It's better described as two separate structures.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Structure 1:** Two red arch-shaped blocks form the base, side-by-side, but not touching. A yellow, arched-top block rests on top of these two red arches, bridging them.\n    *    **Structure 2:** One orange triangular block at the base, one red arch-shaped blocks form the middle, side-by-side, but not touching. One green rectangular block on top of the red arch.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required:\n\n*   **Red Arch:** We need *three* of these, matching the orientation in the dictionary. This corresponds to block index **1**.\n*    **Orange Triangular Block:** We need *one* of this, This corresponds to block index **15**.\n*   **Yellow Arched-Top:** We need *one* of these, in the horizontal orientation shown. This corresponds to block index **10**.\n* **Green Rectangular Block:** We need one of this block, flat. This corresponds to block index **7**.\n\nTherefore, the list of block indices is: **1, 1, 1, 10, 15, 7**\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 15\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n\n}\n```\nExplanation of assembly order, the structure can build that two independed structure seperately.\nFirst build the structure composed of yellow and red blocks. Put two red arch(index 1) on the ground, then put the yellow arched-Top(index 10) on top of that.\nSecond, build the structure composed of orange, red and green blocks. Put orange triangular(index 15), then put red arch(index 1), and finally put the green block(index 7).\n"

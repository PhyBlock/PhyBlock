Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Counts & Layers:** The structure we are focused on consists of 8 blocks and is broadly organized into 3 layers, excluding the separate small house construction. The base layer is made up of two arch pieces. The middle layer consists of three rectangular blocks, with two smaller rectangular blocks and a large rectangular block on top of them.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Two red arch blocks form the base, spaced apart.\n    *   A long yellow rectangular block spans the two arch blocks.\n    *    A blue cube sits on top of the yellow block, to one end.\n    *   A green rectanglar block sits on top of the yellow block, next to the blue cube.\n    *   An orange ramp block lies on the green block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   1 (Red Arch) - Need 2\n    *   3 (Blue Cube)\n    *    8 (Green Rectangle)\n    *   11 (Yellow Rectangle)\n    * 15 (Orange ramp)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 3\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

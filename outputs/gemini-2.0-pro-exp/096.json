Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks. It has roughly two layers. The base layer is composed of mostly rectangular blocks and a cylindrical one. The second layer has a U-shaped block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   A orange cylinder is standing upright, with a red U-shaped block sitting on top of it.\n    *   From left view, a small orange triangle block, green rectangular block, blue rectangular block, and yellow rectanglar block form together the rectangular shape to the left of the cylinder.\n    *   The green block is at the bottom, with the blue and yellow blocks stacked on top of it, side-by-side.\n    *  The orange triangle is beside the green block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   3 (Red U-shaped block)\n    *   6 (Blue rectangular block)\n    *   7 (Yellow rectangular block)\n    *   8 (Green rectangular block)\n    *   13 (Orange cylinder)\n    *  15 (small orange triangle)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 8\n    Step3: Move block with index 15\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 3\n}\n```\n"

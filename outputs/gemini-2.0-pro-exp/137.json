Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 11 blocks and has conceptually 3 layers, if we consider connected archs as the foundational layer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Two red arch blocks form the base, side by side, creating a longer arched tunnel.\n    *   **Layer 2:**\n        *   Two yellow half-cylinder blocks are placed on top of the connecting part of two arch blocks.\n        *    One blue square block is on top of the left arch.\n        *   One orange square block is on top of the right arch.\n        *   One green rectangular block is placed veritcally behind and connects the orange roof block and arch.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Top):**\n        *   Two orange roof blocks are placed on the top of the blue and orange square blocks respectively.\n        *   One yellow rectanglar block is in the middle and placed vertically, on top of two yellow half-cylinder blocks.\n        *   One small yellow rectangular block is placed between two orange roof bolcks and behind the vertical yellow block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **1:** Two (Red arch)\n*   **5:** One (Blue square block)\n*  **7:** One (Orange square block)\n*   **8:** One (Green rectangular block)\n*  **12:** One (Yellow rectangular block, vertical orientation)\n*  **13:** One (Yellow rectanglar block, horizontal orientation)\n*  **14:** Two (Yellow half-cylinder)\n*   **15:** Two (Orange roof)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 14\n    Step4: Move block with index 14\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 8\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 15\n    Step10: Move block with index 12\n    Step11: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

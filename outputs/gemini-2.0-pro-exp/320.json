Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 3 blocks and has 3 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The bottom layer is a single, horizontally-oriented green rectangular block.\n    *   The middle layer is orange cylinder.\n    *   The top layer has a green \"U\" shaped block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure is composed of 6 blocks, organized in roughly 3 layers.\n    * The bottom layer has a red \"archway/tunnel\" block. There are two orange triangle at both end of tunnel.\n    *   The middle Layer contains a yellow half-cylinder.\n    * The top layer has two yellow quarter-circle.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 8 (Green rectangular block, horizontal)\n    *   Block 9 (Orange cylinder)\n    *    Block 4 (Green \"U\" shaped Block)\n\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 1 (Red \"archway\" block)\n    *    Block 13, 16 (Two triangle block)\n    *   Block 10 (Yellow, half-cylinder block)\n    *    Block 11, 12 (Yellow, Two quarter-circle block)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n**Structure 1**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 8\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n**Structure 2**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 13\n    Step3: Move block with index 16\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n}\n```\n"

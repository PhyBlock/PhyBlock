Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure appears to have 5 blocks and is built in roughly three layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** A blue rectangular block at the base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A yellow rectangular block on top of the blue one.\n    *    **Layer3:** An orange square block is placed at the top of yellow block.\n    *   **Layer 4:** A orange cylinder is put on top of the square block.\n    *   **Layer 5:** Two connected blocks placed at the very top, a red half-cylinder linked with yellow curve.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right Side):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure uses 9 blocks and is also built in multiple layers (approximately 3).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1:** Two red arch blocks forming the base.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two yellow half-cylinder blcoks are put on top of the red arch blocks. Followed by a blue cube, a green rectangular block and a red cube placed adjacently.\n    *   **Layer 3**: Two yellow blocks placed on top.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the required block indices:\n\n**Structure 1:**\n\n*   Blue rectangular block (horizontal): Index 5\n*   Yellow rectangular block (horizontal): Index 10\n*  Orange Square block: Index 4\n* Orange cylinder: Index 11\n* Red half-cylinder and curve: Index 2\n\n**Structure 2:**\n\n*   Red arch: Index 1 (x2)\n*   Yellow half-cylinder: Index 14 (x2)\n*   Blue cube: Index 3\n*   Green rectangular block (vertical): Index 7\n*   Red Cube: Index 4\n*   Yellow rectangular block (vertical): Index 9 (x2)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 10\n    Step3: Move block with index 4\n    Step4: Move block with index 11\n    Step5: Move block with index 2\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 1\n    Step8: Move block with index 14\n    Step9: Move block with index 14\n    Step10: Move block with index 3\n    Step11: Move block with index 7\n    Step12: Move block with index 4\n    Step13: Move block with index 9\n    Step14: Move block with index 9\n\n}\n```\n"

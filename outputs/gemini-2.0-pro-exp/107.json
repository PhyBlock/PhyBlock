Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 4 blocks. It has conceptually two layers: a base layer of supports, an intermediate rectangular block, and a top layer with a triangular prism.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer is composed of two yellow, semi-cylindrical blocks placed horizontally and parallel to each other.\n    *   Resting on top and spanning across those two base blocks is a yellow rectangular prism, also positioned horizontally.\n    *   Centred on top of the rectangular prism is an orange, triangular prism.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks from the dictionary are needed:\n\n*   Two instances of the yellow half-cylinder in a horizontal placement: Block index **5** (need two)\n*   One yellow rectangular block, horizontally placed. Block index **1**\n*   One horizontally placed orange triangular prism. Block index **13**\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 5, 5, 1, 13\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe logical assembly order would be to place the base supports first, then the rectangular block, and finally the triangular prism on top.\n\n**Output in the Required Format:**\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 5\n    Step2: Move block with index 5\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

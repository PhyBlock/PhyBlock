Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks arranged in 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Two red arch-shaped blocks form the foundation. They are parallel to each other.\n    *   **Layer 2:** One yellow rectangular block placed horizontally, bridging the two red arches.\n    *   **Layer 3:** Two green rectangular blocks oriented vertically, standing on the yellow block, equal distant to the ends, and are parallel.\n    *   **Layer 4:** One yellow rectangle is placed horizontally to connect the tops of two green blocks, and an orange triangle is put on the yellow block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block Indices:**\n    *   1 (Red arch - used twice)\n    *   10 (Yellow rectangle)\n    *   8 (Green rectangle - used twice)\n    *    12(Yellow rectangle)\n    *    14(Orange Triangle)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

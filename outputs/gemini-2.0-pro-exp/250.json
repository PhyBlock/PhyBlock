            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the building instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two separate structures. Let's analyze them individually:\n\n**Structure 1 (Left):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure consists of 6 blocks and appears to have 3 layers.\n    *   Layer 1: A yellow rectangular block, laid horizontally.\n    *   Layer 2: Two orange cylindrical blocks, standing vertically on the yellow block.\n    *    Layer 3: A yellow rectangular block on the cylinders, one red rectangular block, one blue rectanglar block, and one orange triangle block on top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer is a single, long yellow rectangular block.\n    .   Two orange cylinders are placed vertically on top of the yellow base, side-by-side.\n    .   Another yellow rectanglar block is placed on top of the cylinders.\n    .  A red rectangular and a blue rectangular block is placed on the yellow block.\n    . An orange triangle block is placed on the red and blue block.\n\n**Structure 2 (Right):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** This structure appears to be made of a single, complex block. It essentially looks like a rectangular frame with a hollow, cylindrical core.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** N/A - It is a single combined unit.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the required block indices:\n\n*   **Structure 1:**\n    *   Block 9 (Yellow rectangular block - base) - Used Twice.\n    *   Block 11 (Orange cylinder) - Used Twice.\n    *    Block 5 (Red rectangular block)\n    *   Block 7 (Blue rectangular block)\n    *   Block 15 (Orange Triangle)\n*   **Structure 2:**\n    *   Block 1 (Reddish frame with a cylindrical hole)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 11\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 5\n    Step6: Move block with index 7\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\nExplanation of steps:\nSteps 1-7 are building the structure.\nStep 8 is moving the other block closer.\n"

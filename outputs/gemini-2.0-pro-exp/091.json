Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 9 blocks arranged in roughly 3 layers.\n    *   **Bottom Layer:** 4 orange cylindrical blocks forming the legs.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** 2 yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally, side-by-side, make up the seat.\n    *   **Top Layer:** A small green block, an upright blue cube and the yellow half cylinder on top of them at the back, forming the backrest, although this may also be considered as a separate layer.\n*    **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The four orange cylindrical blocks are positioned at the corners, supporting the structure.\n    *   The two yellow rectangular blocks are adjacent to each other, creating a wider surface.\n    *\t The green block is in the middle, back of the yellow rectangular. The blue cube is on top of that, and the yellow half-cylinder at the top of the construction.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are needed:\n\n*   **9:** (Orange Cylinder) - Used 4 times for the legs.\n*   **4:** (Yellow Rectangle) - Used 2 time for the seat.\n*   **2:** (Green Cube) - Used 1 time for the small green block.\n*   **1:** (Blue Cube)- Used 1 time.\n*   **10:** (Yellow Half Cylinder)- Used 1 time.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 9\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 9\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 4\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 2\n    Step8: Move block with index 1\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 11 blocks. It has two primary layers: a base layer and a top layer. There's also an isolated structure composed of two blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** There are four arch-shaped red blocks forming the foundation, all oriented in the same direction. Two yellow half-cylinders rest on two of the adjacent arches.\n    * **Top Layer:** There are two orange triangular prisms on top of the base layer. A blue cube sits on the yellow cylinder. Two yellow rectangular prisms stand up, one on the arch and the other on the orange triangular prism. A green rectangular prism sits next to the four arch-shaped red blocks.\n    *   **Isolated structure.** There is an additional structure that consists of one arch-shaped block, and on top of it is an orange triangular prism.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are required:\n\n*   **Block Indices:** 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 13.\n\n*There are five Block 1(arch shape), one Block 4(blue cube), one Block 7(green rectangular prism), one Block 8(yellow rectangular prism), one block 9(yellow rectangular prism), one block 11(yellow half-cylinder), and two block 13(orange triangular prism)*\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 11\n    Step6: Move block with index 4\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 8\n    Step9: Move block with index 9\n    Step10: Move block with index 13\n    Step11: Move block with index 13\n}\n```\n"

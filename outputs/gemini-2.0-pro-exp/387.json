            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the building instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Block Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 10 blocks. We can conceptually divide it into two sub-structures:\n    *   A green and orange structure (left side): 4 blocks, with the green \"U\" shape being multi-layered.\n    *  An orange, yellow structure(Right Side): 6 blocks, with the highest part composed of three orange blocks( two cylinders and one triangle), and the base has two vertical orange cyclinders, the top has two horizontal yellow blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Left Sub-structure:**\n        *   A green, square-like base.\n        *   An orange cylinder is placed vertically on top of the green base.\n        *  A green \"U\" shaped block rests vertically on top of the orange cyclinder.\n    *   **Right Sub-structure:**\n        *   Two orange cylinders are placed vertically, side-by-side.\n        *   Two yellow rectangular blocks are laid horizontally on top of these two orange cylinders, bridging them.\n        *   A third orange cyclinder put on the middle of the top yellow rectangular.\n        *   An orange triangular prism is placed on top of the third orange cyclinder.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   **Green and Orange Sub-structure:**\n    *   Block 1: Green Square Base\n    *   Block 12: Orange Cyclinder\n    *   Block 3: Green \"U\" shape\n    *  Block 12: Orange Cyclinder\n\n*   **Orange and Yellow Sub-structure:**\n    *   Block 12: Orange Cylinder (x2)\n    *   Block 7: Yellow Rectangular (need two)\n    *   Block 12: Orange Cylinder\n    *   Block 15: Orange Triangular\n\n    The block indices are therefore: 1, 3, 12, 12, 7, 7, 12, 12, 15.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 12\n    Step5: Move block with index 12\n    Step6: Move block with index 12\n    Step7: Move block with index 7\n    Step8: Move block with index 7\n    Step9: Move block with index 12\n    Step10: Move block with index 15\n\n}\n```\n"

I will focus on the structure on the *right* side of the main target image, as it appears to be the one not overlapping.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image (Right-Side Structure):**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure appears to be composed of 9 blocks. It has two main layers: a base layer and a top layer consisting of single, small cube centered on top.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** The base layer consists of a central, four way intersection made of 4 blue rectangular blocks, oriented vertically, meeting at the center. 4 orange wedge-shaped blocks surround the intersection, positioned in between each blue block and oriented inwards, such that the short angled side of each matches a side of the central square.\n    * **Top Layer:** One green, cube-shaped is places in the center on the base layer.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Four blue rectangular blocks, vertically oriented: Block index 6 (four times)\n*    Four orange wedge/triangular prism, sloped side facing center: Block index 15 (four times)\n*   One small green cube: Block index 2 (one time)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 6, 6, 6, 6, 15, 15, 15, 15, 2\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 6\n    Step4: Move block with index 6\n    Step5: Move block with index 15\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n    Step7: Move block with index 15\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n}\n```\n**Explanation of assembly**\nFirst place the four blue blocks in the correct orientation to form the base intersection. Then, Place the four orance wedge blocks in their respective positions. Finally, add the green cube on top.\n"

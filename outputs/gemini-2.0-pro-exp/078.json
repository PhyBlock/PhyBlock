            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the construction steps.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 9 blocks. It has two primary layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:**  A base layer made up of 4 blocks forming a square with a hole in the middle.\n    *   **Top Layer:**  A top Layer made up of 5 blocks. 2 square blocks, 1 on top of the left side of the hole, and 1 on top of the right side. 2 triangular prisms sitting on the remaining 2 blocks forming the base, and 1 square block spanning the top of the 2 square blocks, forming a \"roof\".\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** Four blocks (likely the 'tunnel' shaped blocks) form the base, creating a square shape with an empty space in the center. Two yellow blocks are on opposite sides of this square, the red tunnel shapes complete it on opposite sides.\n    *   **Top layer:** On top of the base, on the left, a green block. Next to it, on the right, a blue block. On the other side of the \"roof\", on the base blocks, 2 orange triangular prisms, and on top of it all, an orange square \"roof\".\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Red Tunnel shape blocks**: 2 (for the front and back of the base)\n*    **Yellow Block:** 2 (for the sides of base)\n*   **Green Block:** 1 (For top left)\n*  **Blue block** 1 (For top Right)\n* **Orange triangular prisms** 2\n*  **Orange roof**: 1\n\nThe Block Indices are:\n\n*   1 (Red Tunnel) - x2\n*   9 (Yellow block) - x2\n*   7 (Green block) - x1\n* 6 (Blue block) - x1\n* 12 (Orange Triangulare prism) - x2\n*  10 (Orange roof) - x1\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence, inferred from the images and chosen blocks:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 9\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 6\n    Step7: Move block with index 12\n    Step8: Move block with index 12\n    Step9: Move block with index 10\n}\n```\n"

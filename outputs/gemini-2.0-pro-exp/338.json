Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe target structure consists of two separate sub-structures:\n\n*   **Sub-structure 1 (Chair-like):**\n    *   **Layers:** This structure has roughly four layers.\n    *   **Blocks:**\n        *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Three orange cylindrical blocks standing vertically, side-by-side.\n        *   Layer 2: Two yellow rectangular blocks, lying horizontally, bridging the three cylinders.\n        *   Layer 3:One green rectangle block, standing vertically, in the middle.\n        *   Layer 4: (Top) A yellow arch, horizontal, with one end connecting to the top of the yellow block.\n    *    **Spatial Relationships:**\n        * The cylinders support two horizontal rectangles.\n        * A green vertical rectangle is standing on the horizontal rectangle.\n        * A yellow arch is on the top.\n\n*   **Sub-structure 2 (Bridge-like):**\n    *    **Layers:** This has two layer.\n    *   **Blocks:**\n        *    Layer 1: Consists of two connected red blocks, arch-shaped, making a larger, wavy base.\n        *    Layer 2: One small blue cube resting on top of the red structure, centered.\n\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   The blue cube sits centrally on the curved top of the joined red blocks.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Sub-structure 1:**\n    *   Block Index 12 (Orange Cylinder): x3\n    *   Block Index 10 (Yellow Rectangle): x2\n    *   Block index 9(Green Rectangle): x1\n    *   Block Index 13 (Yellow Arch): x1\n\n*   **Sub-structure 2:**\n    *   Block Index 2 (Red Arch): x2\n    *   Block Index 4 (Blue Cube): x1\n\n**Total Block Indices:** 12, 12, 12, 10, 10, 9, 13, 2, 2, 4.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\nHere's the step-by step assembly.\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 12\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 12\n    Step4: Move block with index 10\n    Step5: Move block with index 10\n    Step6: Move block with index 9\n    Step7: Move block with index 13\n    Step8: Move block with index 2\n    Step9: Move block with index 2\n    Step10: Move block with index 4\n}\n```\n"

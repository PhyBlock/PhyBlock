Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks and can be conceptually divided into 3 layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** Two vertical cylindrical blocks.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Two horizontal rectangular blocks and two house shaped blocks.\n    * **Top Layer**: One verticle cylindrical block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer consists of two orange cylinders, positioned vertically and parallel to each other, forming the support.\n    *   The middle layer has two yellow rectangular blocks placed horizontally, perpendicular to and on top of the cylinders. There are two orange blocks placed on top that look like houses.\n    *   The top layer constist of one orange cylinder, positioned vertically, with two orange house shaped blocks on top.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   **Block 6:** Orange Cylinder (Vertical) - Used three times (twice in the base, and one on top).\n*   **Block 1:** Yellow Rectangle (Horizontal) - used two times\n* **Block 13**: Orange House - used Two Times\n\n**List of Block Indices:**\n\n6, 6, 1, 1, 13, 13, 6\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 6\n    Step2: Move block with index 6\n    Step3: Move block with index 1\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 13\n    Step6: Move block with index 13\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n\n}\n```\n"

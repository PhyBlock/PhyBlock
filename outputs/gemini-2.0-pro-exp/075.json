There are conceptually three layers:\n    *   Bottom Layer: Two cylindrical blocks.\n    .   Middle Layer: Two horizontally placed rectangular blocks.\n    *   Top Layer: Two arch, one triangular prism.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two orange cylinder blocks creates the base and are spaced.\n    *   Two yellow rectangular blocks are placed above the cylindrical blocks.\n    *   One red arch block is placed on top of the two yellow blocks.\n    *   One triangular prism is placed on top of the yellow block and beside the arch.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   Two orange cylinder: 12, 13\n*   Two yellow rectangular block: 7, 10\n*    One red arch: 1\n*    One orange triangular prism: 15\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nThe assembly order is inferred as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 13\n    Step2: Move block with index 12\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 15\n}\n```\n"

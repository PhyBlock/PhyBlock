Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 5 blocks in total. It has two layers:\n    *   Bottom Layer: Four orange cylindrical blocks.\n    *   Top Layer: One green rectangular block.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The four orange cylindrical blocks are arranged vertically, forming the base. They are close together, forming a somewhat square-like formation, but not perfectly square. It is more like 2 pairs of cylinders close and then the two pairs next to each other.\n    *   The green rectangular block rests horizontally on top of the four cylindrical blocks, spanning across them.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\n*   **Needed Blocks:**\n    *   Four orange cylindrical blocks in a vertical orientation.\n    *   One green rectangular block in a horizontal orientation.\n*   **List Block Indices:**\n    *   Orange Cylindrical Block (Vertical): Block index 7 (we need four of these)\n    *   Green Rectangular Block (Horizontal): Block index 1 (or 2, 5, or 6, since they are equal)\n*    **Matching Criteria:** All blocks in the block dictionary image are in the correct orientation needed.\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 7\n    Step3: Move block with index 7\n    Step4: Move block with index 7\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n}\n```\n"

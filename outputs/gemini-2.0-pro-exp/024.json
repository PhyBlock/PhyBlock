            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the images and determine the building instructions.\n\n**1. Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks. It has 4 layers.\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): Two blocks (green and orange).\n    *   Layer 2: Two blocks (orange and green).\n    *   Layer 3: Two blocks (blue, stacked, one rotated)\n    *   Layer 4 (Top): Two triangular blocks.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The base layer has a green block and an orange block, side-by-side.\n    *   The second layer has a mirrored configuration of the first layer. An orange block and green block, side by side.\n    *    The third layer has two blue blocks. One is set back and to the left. The second blue block is to it's right, and rotated inwards, to create the gap.\n    *   The top layer consists of two orange triangular prism blocks forming a roof, spanning across the blue block below.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need the following blocks:\n\n*   Block Index 2 (Green Cube) - Appears once\n*   Block Index 3 (Orange Cube) - Appears twice.\n*   Block Index 7 (Blue Cube) - Appears Once\n*   Block Index 1 (Green Cube)- Appears once\n*    Block Index 8 (Blue Cube)- Appears once\n*   Block Index 14 (Orange Triangular Prism) - Appears once\n*   Block Index 15 (Orange Triangular Prism) - Appears once\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 2\n    Step2: Move block with index 3\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 7\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 14\n    Step8: Move block with index 15\n\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Assembly Steps**\n\n1.  Place down block with index 2.\n2.  Place block of index 3, next to block with index 2.\n3.  Place the third block (index 3)\n4.  Place the fourth block, with index 1, next to the second layer's first block (index 3).\n5. The fifth block with index 7 is placed in the third layer.\n6. Block of index 8 is placed next to the third layers first cube.\n7. Block with index 14 is placed on the blue layer.\n8. Block with index 15 is placed next to the other roof block to finish the model.\n"

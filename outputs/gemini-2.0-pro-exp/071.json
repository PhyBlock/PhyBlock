Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 11 blocks and can be conceptually divided into 4 layers.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** Two red arch-shaped blocks facing outwards, with a yellow rectangular block placed horizontally between them.\n    *   **Layer 2:** Two red arch shaped blocks facing outwards, perpendicular to the arches in layer 1. A yellow rectangular block placed horizontally between them, also perpendicular to the yellow block in Layer 1.\n    * **Layer 3**: Two green blocks placed vertically. One yellow rectangular block between the two green blocks.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Top):** One orange triangular prism block on top of the yellow block in Layer 3.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are required:\n\n*   **Red Arch:** 1 (Used four times)\n*  **Yellow Rectangular:** 8 (Used three times)\n*   **Green Rectangular:** 6 (Used two times)\n*  **Orange triangle:** 14 (Used one time)\n\n**List of Block Indices:** 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 8, 6, 6, 8, 14\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 1\n    Step2: Move block with index 1\n    Step3: Move block with index 8\n    Step4: Move block with index 1\n    Step5: Move block with index 1\n    Step6: Move block with index 8\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n    Step8: Move block with index 6\n    Step9: Move block with index 8\n    Step10: Move block with index 14\n}\n```\n"

Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 7 blocks. It can be conceptually divided into three layers:\n    *   **Base Layer:** One horizontal rectangular block.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Two vertical cylindrical blocks and one horizontal rectangular block.\n    *   **Top Layer:** One arch and two triangle blocks.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** A single, yellow, horizontally-oriented rectangular block forms the foundation.\n    *   **Middle Layer:** Two orange, vertically-oriented cylindrical blocks are placed on top of the base, spaced apart. Another yellow horizontally-oriented rectangular block is placed on the top of two cyclinder blocks.\n    *    **Top Layer:** A red arch block is placed on the top of the yellow rectangular block. And then, there are two triangle blocks are put on the arch block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following blocks are needed:\n\n*   Block Index 5: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (Base layer)\n*   Block Index 8: Orange vertical cylinder (x2) (Middle layer)\n*   Block Index 7: Yellow horizontal rectangular block (Middle layer)\n*    Block Index 1: Red arch (Top layer)\n*    Block Index 13: Orange triangle block(Top layer)\n*    Block Index 15: Orange triangle block (Top layer)\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\nHere's the step by step instruction.\n\n{\nStep1: Move block with index 5\nStep2: Move block with index 8\nStep3: Move block with index 8\nStep4: Move block with index 7\nStep5: Move block with index 1\nStep6: Move block with index 13\nStep7: Move block with index 15\n}\n"

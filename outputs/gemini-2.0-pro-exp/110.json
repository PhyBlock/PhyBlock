Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The structure consists of 8 blocks and can be conceptually divided into roughly 5 layers (from bottom to top):\n    1.  Feet (two yellow half-cylinder blocks)\n    2.  Base (a blue cube and yellow rectangle)\n    3. One green rectangle block\n    4.  Middle Section (a red arch and red rectangle)\n    5.  Top (an orange triangle).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   The two yellow half-cylinder blocks form the base and are placed side-by-side.\n    *  One Blue cube is on the top of part of two yellow half-cylinder.\n    *   The yellow rectangular block is on the top of the blue cube and partly two yellow half-cylinder.\n    *  One green rectangle block stands up straight, on the yellow rectangle block.\n    *   The red arch is placed on the green rectangle block.\n    *    A red rectangular block sits atop the green block, and partly on the red arch.\n    *   The orange triangular block forms the top, resting on the red rectangular block.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following block indices are needed:\n\n*   **11:** Two of these (yellow half-cylinders for the feet)\n*   **3:** One of this (Blue cube)\n* **9:** One of this (yellow rectangle block)\n*   **8:** One of this (green rectangle block)\n*   **1:** One of this (red arch)\n* **5**: One of this (Red rectangle)\n*   **16:** One of this (orange triangle for the top)\n\n**3. Determine the Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 11\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 3\n    Step4: Move block with index 9\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 1\n    Step7: Move block with index 5\n    Step8: Move block with index 16\n}\n```\n"

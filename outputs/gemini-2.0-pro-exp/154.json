Analysis and Description of the Main Target Image:**\n\nThe main target image shows two distinct structures. I will analyze the taller structure on the right, as it seems to be the primary focus based on similar prior examples.\n\n*   **Count & Layers:** The taller structure appears to be composed of 8 blocks, arranged in roughly 6 layers (from bottom to top).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Layer 1 (Base):** A single, light green, square block.\n    *   **Layer 2:** A tall orange cylinder placed centrally on the base.\n    *    **Layer 3:** A yellow, horizontal, rectangular block placed on top of the cylinder.\n    *   **Layer 4:** Two green, vertical, rectangular blocks. One block on each side, creating a frame.\n    *   **Layer 5:** One yellow, horizontal, rectangular block, spanning the space between the vertical frame blocks.\n    *   **Layer 6** A single blue cube.\n\n**2. Selection of Required Blocks from the Dictionary:**\n\nBased on my analysis, I need the following blocks from the dictionary:\n\n*   **Layer 1:** Block 7 (light green, square block)\n*   **Layer 2:** Block 11 (tall orange cylinder)\n*    **Layer 3:** Block 10 (horizontal yellow rectangle)\n*   **Layer 4:** Block 8 (vertical green rectangle) x 2\n*   **Layer 5:** Block 10 (horizontal yellow rectangle)\n*   **Layer 6:** Block 6 (blue cube).\n\n**Therefore, the list of required block indices is: 7, 11, 10, 8, 8, 10, 6**\n\n**3. Assembly Order:**\n\nHere's the inferred step-by-step assembly sequence:\n\n```\n{\n    Step1: Move block with index 7\n    Step2: Move block with index 11\n    Step3: Move block with index 10\n    Step4: Move block with index 8\n    Step5: Move block with index 8\n    Step6: Move block with index 10\n    Step7: Move block with index 6\n}\n```\n"
